The term \\nmicrobiology was given by French chemist Louis Pasteur (1822-95). \\nMicrobiology is said to have its roots in the great expansion a:r:td development of \\nthe biological sciences that took place after 1850. The term microbe was first used by \\nSedillot (1878). \\nMicroorganism were first living things to appear on earth and the study of fossil\\xad\\nremains indicate that microbial infections and epidemic diseases existed thousands of \\nyears ago. Varo and Columella in the first century BC postulated that diseases w~re \\ncaused by invisible beings (Animalia minuta) inhaled or ingested. Fracastorius of \\nVerona (1546) proposed a contagium vivum as a possible cause of infections disease \\nand Von Plenciz (1762) suggested that each disease was caused by a separate agent. \\nRogen Bacon in the 13th century postulated that disease is produced by invisible \\nliving creatures. This suggestion was made again in 1546 by a physician Girolamo \\nFracastoro (1478-1553) of North Italy. He wrote a treatise-De contagione in which he \\nsaid disease was caused by minute \\'seed\\' or \\'germ\\' and spread from person to person. \\nHis work represents a great landmark in the doctorine of infectious diseases. \\nIn 1665, Robert Hook an English scientist used a simple lens that magnified objects \\napproximately 30X. He examined thin slices of cork, the bark of oak tree and he referred \\nto as \"cells\".

Actually he was a Dutch linen merchant but spent \\nmuch of his spare time constructing simple microscopes composed of double convex \\nlenses held between two silver plates. He constructed over 250 small powerful \\nmicroscopes that could magnify around 50-300 times. Leeuvenhoek was the 1st person \\nto produce precise and correct descriptions of bacteria and protozoa using microscope \\nhe made himself. Because of this extraordinary contribution to microbiology he is \\nconsidered as the \"Father of bacteriology and protozoology\". He wrote over 200 letters \\nwhich was transmitted as a series of letters from 1674-1723 to Royal society in London \\nduring a 50 years period. He wrote four volumes of Arcana Naturae opeet Beneficio \\nExquisite Simom11l Mierovopionun Deteeta. \\nTRANSITION PERIOD \\nAlthough, there were a number of Significant developments in microbiology during \\nVan Leeuvenhoek\\'s time, Peoples were interested to correlate diseases with microbes. \\nThe main aspects were to solve the controversy over spontaneous generation which \\nincludes experimentations mainly of Francesco Redi, John Needham, Lazzaro Spallanzani \\nand Nicolas Appert etc and to know the disease transmission which mainly includes \\nthe work of Ignaz Semmelweis and John Snow. \\nFrancesco Redi (1626-1697): The ancient belief in spontaneous generation was first \\nof all challenged by Redi, an Italian physician, who carried out a series of experiments \\non decaying meat and its ability to produce maggots spontaneously. Redi was the first \\nwho put the theory of spontaneous generation to test by conducting a simple experiment \\nin which he placed meat in three jars. One jar was covered with fine gauze, second \\nwas covered with paper and third was left uncovered. Flies entered the jar that was \\nopen to air i.e. left uncovered and landed on meat where they laid their egg that later \\ndeveloped into maggots. The other two pieces of meat did not produce maggots \\nspontaneously. However flies were attracted to the gauze covered jars and laid their \\neggs on the gauze and maggots subsequently developed without access to the meat, \\nindicating that maggots were the offspring of the flies and did not arise from some \\n\\'vital source\\' in the meat as previously believed. \\nJohn Needham (1713-1781): He was probably the greatest supporter of the theory \\nof spontaneous generation. He proposed that tiny organisms the animalcules arose \\nspontaneously on his mutton gravy. He covered the flasks with cork as done by Redi \\nand even heated some flasks. Still the microbes appeared on mutton broth. \\nLazzaro Spallanzani (1729-1799): He was an Italian Naturalist who attempted to \\nrefute Needham\\'s experiment. He boiled beef broth for longer period, removed the air \\nfrom the flask and then sealed the container. Followed incubation no growth was \\nobserved by him in these flasks. He showed that the heated nutrients could still grow'),\n",

The flasks were heated to sterilize the broth \\nand then incubated. No growth occurred even though the contents of the flasks were \\nexposed to the air. Pasteur pointed out that no growth took place because dust and \\ngerms had been trapped on the walls of the curved necks but if the necks were broken \\noff so that dust fell directly down into the flask, microbial growth commenced \\nimmediately. Some of these ingenious little flasks are still on display at the Pasteur \\nInstitute in Paris in their original sterile form. This experiment clearly showed that \\nmicroorganisms present on or in non-living materials such as dust or water were \\nresponsible for the contamination of sterile solutions.

He also devised a method to destroy microorganisms \\nin the operation theatre by spraying a fine mist of carbolic acid into the air, thus \\nproducing an antiseptic environment. Thus Joseph Lister was the first to introduce aseptic \\ntechniques for control of microbes by the use of physical and chemical agents which \\nare still in use today. Because of this notable contributions, Joseph Lister is known as \\nthe Father of Antiseptic surgery. \\nRobert Koch (1893-1910) gave the first direct demonstration of the role of bacteria \\nin causing disease. He was a german physician who first of all isolated anthrax bacillus \\n(Bacillus alltlzracis, the cause of anthrax) in 1876. He perfected the technique of isolating \\nbacteria in pure culture. He also introduced the use of solid culture media in 1881 by \\nusing gelatin as a solidifying agent. In 1882 he discovered Mycobacterium tuberculosis. \\nHe proposed Koch postulate which were published in 1884 and are the corner stone \\nof the germ theory of diseases and are still in use today to prove the etiology (specific \\ncause) of an infectious disease. The postulates are: \\n1. The suspected microorganism must always be found in diseased but never in \\nhealthy individuals. \\n2. The microorganism must be isolated in a pure culture (one free of all other \\ntypes of microbes) on a nutrient medium. \\n3. The same disease must result when the isolated microorganism is inoculated \\ninto a healthy host. \\n4. The same organism must by reisolated from the experimentally infected host. \\nAlthough viruses and a few other microbes cannot be cultured in artificial media, \\nKoch's postulates are still used today for the cause of most infectious diseases. \\nRobert Koch also used gelatin to prepare solid media but it was not an ideal \\nsolidifying agent because of the two important reasons (i) since gelatin is a protein, \\nit is digested by many bacteria capable of producing a proteolytic exoenzyme gelatinase \\nthat hydrolyses the protein to amino acids and (ii) It melts when the temperature rises \\nabove 25°C. R. Koch will be remembered for both i.e. his contribution in the discovery \\nof important disease producing microorganism and his fundamental contribution to \\nbacteriological techniques. \\nFanne Eilshemius Hesse (1850 - 1934) one of Koch's assistant first proposed the \\nuse of agar in culture media. Agar was superior to gelatin because of its higher melting \\n(i.e. 96°C) and solidifying (i.e. 40-45°C) points than gelatin and was not attacked by \\nmost bacteria. Koch's another assistant Richard Petri in 1887 developed the Petri dish \\n(plate), a container used for solid culture media. Thus contribution of Robert Koch, \\nFannie Fannie Hesse and Richard Petri made possible the isolation of pure cultures of \\nmicroorganisms and directly stimulated progress in all areas of microbiology. \\nEdward Jenner (1749-1823) an English physician was the first to prevent small pox. \\nHe was impressed by the observation that countryside milk maid who contacted cowpox \\n(Cowpox is a milder disease caused by a virus closely related to small pox) while milking\"),\n",

On May 14th, 1796 he proved that inoculating \\npeople with pus from cowpox lesions provided protection against small pox. Jenner in \\n1798, published his results on 23 successful vaccinators. Eventually this process was \\nknown as vaccination, based on the latin word 'Vacca' meaning cow. Thus the use of \\ncow pox virus to protect small pox disease in humans became popular replacing the \\nrisky technique of immunizing with actual small pox material. \\nJenner's experimental significance was realized by Pasteur who next applied this \\nprinciple to the prevention of anthrax and it worked. He called the attenuated cultures \\nvaccines (Vacca = cow) and the process as vaccination. Encouraged by the successful \\nprevention of anthrax by vaccination, Pasteur marched ahead towards the service of \\nhumanity by making a vaccine for hydrophobia or rabies (a disease transmitted to people \\nby bites of dogs and other animals). As with Jenner's vaccination for small pox, principle \\nof the preventive treatment of rabies also worked fully which laid the foundation of \\nmodern immunization programme against many dreaded diseases like diphtheria, \\ntetanus, pertussis, polio and measles etc. \\nElie Metchnikoff (1845-1916) proposed the phagocytic theory of immunity in 1883. \\nHe discovered that some blood leukocytes, white blood cells (WBC) protect against \\ndisease by engulfing disease causing bacteria. These cells were called phagocytes and \\nthe process phagocytosis. Thus human blood cells also confer immunity, referred to as \\ncellular immunity. \\nEmile Roux (1853-1933) and Alexandre Yersin, the two notable French bacteriologists \\ndemonstrated the production of toxin in filtrates of broth cultures of the diphtheria \\norganism. Emil von Behring (1854 -1917) and Shibasaburo Kitasato (1852-1931) both \\ncolleagues of Robert Koch, in 1890 discovered tetanus (lock jaw) antitoxin. Only about \\na week after the announcement of the discovery of tetanus antitoxin, Von Behring in \\n1890 reported on immunization against diphtheria by diphtheria antitoxin. The discovery \\nof toxin-antitoxin relationship was very important to the development of science of \\nimmunology. \\nWhile all these milestones were being laid in the field of microbiology, an English \\nsurgeon, Joseph Lister (1827-1912) was trying to combat the microbes that caused post \\noperative and wound infection disaster searched for a way to keep bacteria out of \\nwounds and the incisions made by surgeons. He used a dilute solution of carbolic acid \\nto soak surgical dressings that kept the wounds free from microbial infection and healing \\ntook place rapidly. So remarkable was his success that the technique was quickly \\naccepted and the principle of present day aseptic technique was established. \\nPaul Ehrlich (1854-1915) in 1904 found that the dye Trypan Red was active against \\nthe trypanosome that causes African sleeping sickness and could be used therapeutically. \\nThis dye with antimicrobial activity was referred to as a 'magic bullet'. Subsequently \\nin 1910, Ehrlich in collaboration with Sakahiro Hata, a japanese physician, introduced \\nthe drug Salvarsan (arsenobenzol) as a treatment for syphilis caused by Treponema \\npallidu11l. Ehrlich's work had laid important foundations for many of the developments \\nto come and the use of Salvarsen marked the beginning of the eni of chemotherapy \\nand the use of chemicals that selectively inhibit or kill pathogens without causing damage \\nto the patient.\"),\n",

In the same year two French scientists Jacques \\nand Therese Trefonel showed that the compound Prontosil was broken down within \\nthe body of the animal to sulfanilamide (Sulfa drug) the true active factor. Domagk \\nwas awarded nobel prize in 1939 for the discovery of the first sulpha drug. \\nThe credit for the discovery of first 'wonder drug' penicillin in 1929 goes to Sir \\nAlexander Fleming of England, a Scottish physician and bacteriologist. Fleming had \\nbeen actually interested in searching something that would kill pathogens ever since \\nworking on wound infections during the first world war (1914-1918). One day in 1928 \\nupon his return from a week's vacation, Fleming observed that a plate of Staphylococcus \\naureus had become contaminated with a green mold Penicillium notahHn which had \\naccidentially fallen in plate. Observing this plate, Fleming noted that the colonies of \\nStaphylococcus bacterium were evidently being destroyed by the nearby Penicillium \\ncolonies. Rather than discarding the contaminated plate, he speculated that the mold \\nwas producing a diffusible substance that inhibited the bacterial growth. Fleming isolated \\nand subcultured the mold for further study. He extracted from the fungus a compound \\nwhich he called penicillin, after the name of the producer organism Penicillium notaium, \\nthat could destroy several pathogenic bacteria. Thus, Sir Alexander Fleming in 1929 \\ndiscovered the first antibiotic (Gr. Anti = against + bios = life, the microbial products \\nthat can kill susceptible microorganism and inhibit their growth) penicillin. The \\ncommercial production of penicillin in the USA began in 1941 Fleming, Florey and Chain \\nshared the nobel prize in 1945 for the discovery and production of penicillin.

Waksman received \\nthe noble prize in 1952 for his discovery of Streptomycin used in the treatment of \\ntuberculosis, a bacterial disease ca'..lsed by Mycobateriu11l tuberculosis that had been \\ndiscovered by Robert Koch in 1882.

The \\nrelative simplicity of the microorganism, their short life span and the genetic homogeneity \\nprovided an authentic simulated model to understand the physiological, biochemical \\nand genetical intricacies of the living organisms. The use of microorganisms as a tool \\nto explore fundamental life processes became attractive due to the following facts: \\n1. They reproduce (grow) very rapidly. \\n2. Can be cultured in small and vast quantities conveniently and rapidly. \\n3. Their growth can be manipulated easily by physical and chemical means and \\ntheir cells can be broken apart or the contents can be separated into fractions \\nof various particle sizes. Because of these characteristics microorganisms were \\nused as research models to determine exactly how various life processes take \\nplace in terms of specific reactions and the specific structures involved. \\nThe list of those who contributed to the development of microbiology is far too \\nlong to recite here in its entirety. Here we shall highlight briefly only few of the important \\nmicrobiological accomplishments. \\nGeorge W. Beadle and Edward 1. Tatum both US Scientists, were the pioneers \\nin the area of microbial genetics. They studied the relationship between genes and \\nenzymes in 1941 using mutants of the bread mold fungus, Neurospora crassa and gave \\nthe concept of one-gene -one enzyme hypothesis. Using mutants of Neurospora, they \\ndemonstrated that there was a direct relationship between a single gene and a single \\nenzyme. Beadle and Tatum hypothesized that the synthesis of the compounds essential \\nfor cell growth must be under genetic control. They also concluded that a defect in \\none gene produced a single defect in an essential enzyme resulting in the growth factor \\nrequirement, that is one gene one - enzyme theory. Lederberg, Beadle and Tatum were \\nawarded the nobel prize in 1958 for the discovery of one gene one enzyme hypothesis. \\nMax Delbruck and Salvadore Luria in 1943 described the genetic nature of viruses. \\nThey also proved that gene mutations were truly spontaneous and not directed by the \\nenvironment. DNA is the genetic material and carried genetic information during \\ntransformation in bacteria was demonstrated in 1944 by Oswald, T. Avery, Colin. M. \\nMaclead and Maclyn McCarty. In 1952 Joshua Lederberg first of all introduced the term \\n'Plasmid' to describe nonchromosomal genetic material in bacteria. In collaboration with \\nNorton Zinder, a student in his laboratory at Wisconsin, USA, Lederberg discovered \\nthat genetic information could be transferred between bacteria by bacteriophage this \\nprocess was known as transduction. Lederberg along with his wife Esther, developed \\na unique method of studying bacterial mutants, now known as 'replica plating' using \\nthis method it is possible to transfer bacterial colonies from one agar growth plate to \\nother so that each new plate is an exact replica of the original. With this technique, \\nLederberg showed that mutations in bacteria occur randomly and spontaneously. Thus \\ndiscovery made by Lederberg in bacterial genetics - transduction and conjugation in \\nbacteria have made the science of bacterial genetics and have subsequently spawned \\nmany advances including aspects of modern molecular genetics of gene cloning. Thus \\nJ. Lederberg single handedly changed the nature of bacterial genetics and biochemistry.\"),\n",

Berlage (1940), Whipple (1947) and \\nHoyle (1950) has proposed new hypothesis. The general trend is toward a modified \\nversion of the ancient nebular hypothesis. \\nAccording to nebular hypothesis about 10-20 bi11ion yrs ago, cosmos was in the \\nform of a small sphere of highly condensed mass of cosmic material, with a big bang \\nit exploded into numerous pieces called nebulae. Our solar system originated from one \\nof these nebulae. The nebula was a cold and spinning cloudy mass· of cosmic dust or \\ngases. The central mass of nebula condensed to form a primitive sun. As it condensed, \\nthe sun became hotter and brighter due to the conversion of gravitational energy into \\nheat. Higher temperature initiated thermonuclear reaction in the sun which then started \\nemitting solar radiation. \\nBecause of rotational movement of nebula, a ring of cloud got separated, spinning \\naround the central mass and condensed into planets including our earth. As the earth \\nwas formed by the condensation of nebular mass, its temperature increased due to \\ninternal pressure, gravitation and effect of solar heating. \\nThus initially the earth was a fiery spinning ball of hot gases and vapours of various \\nelements. Through hundreds, millions years, the gases condensed into a molten core \\nand different elements got stratified according to their density. The heavy elements like \\niron and nickel etc. sank to the centre and formed solid core of the earth, the lighter \\nelements like silicon and aluminum rose to the surface and solidified to form the surface \\nor crust. The part of the earth between core and crust formed mantle which is solid \\nand m~de up of iron, magnesium and silicates. \\nThe lightest ones like He, H, °2, N2 and C flowed out of the surface and formed \\nthe gaseous atmosphere. \\nThe Primitive Atmosphere of Earth \\nThe original temperature of earth was supposed to be 900°C initially. This \\ntemperature was such high that the elements like H 2, N2, °2, and C could not exist \\nin free state. These gases combined variously either among themselves or with metals \\nforming oxides, carbides and nitrides. Thus carbon formed dicarbon, cyanogens, \\nmethane, CO 2, CO and metal carbides. Nitrogen formed nitrides with metals, oxygen \\nformed oxides and H2 combined with 02 to form water, with N2 to form ammonia, \\nmethane and carbon cyanamide with carbon. \\nInitially the temperature was too high that all these compound existed in gaseous \\nstate and water as superheated steam. These formed the atmosphere of primitive earth. \\nThis atmosphere of primitive earth was unlike our present atmosphere in following \\nrespects: \\n1. Abundance of H2 : The interstellar dust from which earth originated was \\nespecially rich in H 2. It readily combined with N2 forming ammonia, with 02 to form \\nwater and methane with carbo~ The primitive earth atmosphere was highly reducing. \\n2. Absence of 02 : The atmosphere of primitive earth was non-oxygenic. The free \\noxygen was bound in water, CO, and CO 2 and in metallic oxides on the surface rocks \\nand particles. Because of the absence of free 02 and complex organic compound that \\narose during early time were not subjected to degradation.'),\n",

Absence of ozone layer: There was no layer of ozone to absorb UV rays coming \\non earth from sun. \\nLater the earth cooled gradually, some of the atmospheric gas liquefied, and some \\nof the liquid turned solid. Steam condensed into water and resulted into rain. The rain \\ndroplets on approaching the super heated earth crust immediately evaporated and \\nreturned into the atmosphere. This cycle contin:ued for millions of years and resulted \\nin the cooling of earth surface. As a result the earth surface became cool enough to \\nhold water and large water bodies/first oceans come into existence. About 3 billion \\nyrs ago the earth had a solid crust, frequently punctured by eruptions of molten rocks \\n(Volcanoes) and at places filled with hot boiling sea water. The sea water contained \\ndissolved NH3' methane, some minerals and salts.

The globular nucleoprotenoid microparticles might have been early ribosomes \\nand called protoribosome. \\nProtoviruses : Some giant nucleoprotenoid molecules had certain characteristic of \\na free living gene.

The \\ncomplex so formed represent the exposed nucleus. The cytoplasm might have been \\nacquired but not separated from the nuclear material as in blue green algae or in large \\nbacteria. Finally mutations led to the formation of typical cell with nuclear membrane. \\n(C) BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OR BIOGENY \\nThere are two hypothesis regarding the origin of primitive prokaryotic cell: \\n(a) Horowitz (1945) and Orgel (1973) proposed that nucleoprotein molecules formed \\naggregates in the hot soup of primitive sea. These got surrounded by nutrient shells \\nand limiting membrane and formed the first living cell. \\n(b) Oparin suggested that various macromolecules aggregated in the hot dilute soup \\nto form coacervates which got isolated from the surrounding by the formation of \\npolarized membrane of phospholipids. The coacervate with nucleoproteins developed \\ninto first living cells or protobionts. These first cells were similar to present day \\nmycoplasma and viruses.

They are as distantly related to each other as they are to eukaryotes. \\nTo accommodate this new information three microbiologists C. Woese, O. Kandler and \\nM.L. Wheelis introduced a new classification scheme in 1990. They proposed that all \\norganisms be divided into three major groups or super kingdoms called domains: the \\neukarya (containing all eukaryotes), the bacteria (containing most familiar prokaryotes), \\nand the Archaea (originally called archae bacteria and containing prokaryotes that live \\nmostly in extreme environments). \\nThe discovery of three cell types was based on the observations that ribosomes \\nare not the same in all cells. Ribosomes provide a method of comparing cells because \\nribosomes are present in all cells. Comparing the sequences of nucleotides in 16S rRNA \\nfrom different kinds of cells shows that there are three distinctly different cell groups: \\nthe eukaryotes and two different types of prokaryotes the bacteri~ and the archaea. \\nIn 1978 Carl R. Woese proposed elevating the three cell types to a level above \\nkingdom called domain. Woese believed that the archaea and the bacteria, although \\nsimilar in appearance, should form their own separate domains on the evolutionary tree. \\nIn this scheme, animals, plants, fungi and protests are the kingdoms in the domain \\neukarya. Organisms are classified by cell types in the three domain systems. \\nThe Domain Bacteria includes all of the pathogenic prokaryotes as well as many \\nof the nonpathogenic prokaryotes found in soil and water.

Biochemical and Physiological characters : Many of the biochemical and \\nphysiological characters used to classify bacteria are based on conditions that support \\ngrowth. Do the bacteria grow aerobically, anaerobically or both? What incubation \\ntemperature is most favourable? Over what range of PH do they grow? Are they able \\nto withstand high osmotic strength?

A plastic plate with 96 depressions is prepared each containing \\na colourless form of a tetrazolium dye (an oxidation jreduction indicator that is colorless \\nwhen oxidized and colored when reduced) and a different carbon source. Then a \\nsuspension of bacterial cells is added. If the organism can use the carbon source, the \\ndye is reduced and becomes colored.

Serology : The other way to classify and identify bacteria is through serology \\n(the science that studies serum, the noncellular fraction of blood). Serum contains \\nantibodies (protein molecules made in response to infection). And these antibodies are \\nhighly specific, they target specific microbes. Thus antibodies can distinguish between \\nclosely related microorganisms and even between strains. Sera that inactivate particular \\nbacteria are called antisera. This antisera are used in a number of ways. For example, \\nthey can be used in slide agglulination test to identify particular species or strains. \\nFluorescent labelled antibodies prepared from antisera are also used in a similar but \\nmore sensitive procedure. \\n5. Phage typing: Bacteriophages, or phages (viruses that attack bacteria) can also \\nbe used to classify bacteria. The pattern of strains attacked by a set' of bacteriophages \\nis called phage typing. The diversity of bacterial strains that one bacteriophage will attack \\n(termed the host range) is quiet narrow. Only closely related bacterial strains are attacked \\nby the same phages, phage typing is usually restricted to classifying strains within \\nspecies. \\nIn phage typing, a thin layer of the bacterial strain to be tested is spread on the \\nsurface of an agar plate and small drops of suspensions of various phages are placed \\non the surface. If the bacteria are susceptible to the phages in one or more of the drops \\nthey will lyse, producing a clear zone in the lawn (confluent layer of bacterial growth) \\nthat forms. \\nStrains with identifical phage types are identical. Strains with similar phage types \\nare closely related. Because phage typing can identify specific strains of bacteria, it is \\nused to determine if a cluster of bacterial infection is caused by the same strain. \\n6. Fatty acid analysis (FAME) : Bacteria differ in the type and reative quantity \\nof fatty acids that makeup their membranes, thus the cellular fatty acids composition \\ncan be used as an identifying marker. In gram -ve bacteria the fatty acids are present \\nin both, the cytophlasmic and the outer membranes. Whereas in gram +ve bacteria \\n(lacking an outer membrane), the cytoplasmic membrane is the source of fatty acids. \\nTo analyse their fatty acid composition, bacterial cells are grown under standardised \\nconditions. After this the cells are chemically treated with sodium hydroxide and \\nmethanol to release the fatty acids and to convert those acids to their more volatile \\nmethy ester form (FAME = Fatty acid methyl ester). \\nThe resulting fatty acids, methylated esters can than be separated and analysed \\nusing gas chromatography. By comparing the pattern of peaks, or chromatogram, to \\nthose of known species and isolate can be identified. \\nGENOME COMPARISON \\nIn the 1960s taxonomists began to develop methods to examine greater portions \\nof the genome.

Comparisons of proteins and nucleic acids yield considerable \\ninformation about true relatedness. These molecular approaches have become increasingly, \\nimportant in prokaryotic taxonomy. \\nComparison of Protein \\nAmino acid sequences of proteins are direct reflections of mRNA sequences and \\ntherefore closely related to the structures of the genes coding for their synthesis. \\nComparisons of proteins of different microorganisms are very useful taxonomically. If \\nthe sequences of proteins with the same function are similar, the organisms possessing \\nthem are probably closely related. The sequences of cytochromes and other electron \\ntransport proteins, his tones, heat shock proteins, transcription and translation proteins \\nand a variety of metabolic enzymes have been used in taxonomic studies. The \\nelectrophoretic mobility of proteins is useful in studying relationships at the species and \\nsubspecies level. \\nThe physical kinetic and regulatory properties of enzymes have been employed \\nin taxonomic studies. Because enzyme behavior reflects NH2 acid sequences, which is \\nuseful in studying some microbial group and group specific patterns of regulation have \\nbeen found. \\nNucleic Acid Base Composition \\nThis technique proved useful for microbes. There genomes can be directly compared \\nand taxonomic similarity can be estimated in many ways. It is possibly the most simplest \\ntechnique to be used in the determination of DNA base composition. However, it can \\nbe determined chemically by hydrolyzing DNA sample and separating the free bases \\nwith HPLC, it can be determined more easily by physical methods which is most \\nfrequently used. DNA contains four purine and pyrimidine bases-Adenine (A), Guanine \\n(G), Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T). In double stranded DNA, A pairs with T and \\nG pairs with C. Thus (G + C) / (A + T) ratio or G + C content is the percent of \\nG + C in DNA, reflects the base sequence and varies with sequence changes as \\nfollows:-\\nG+C Mol % G + C = x 100 G+C+A+T \\nThe G + C content often is determined from the melting temperature (fm) of DNA. \\nIn DNA structure 3 hydrogen bonds join GC base pairs and two bonds connect AT \\nbase pairs. As a result the DNA with greater G + C content will have more hydrogen \\nbonds and its strands will separate only at higher temperatures that is it will have a \\nhigher melting point. DNA melting can be easily followed spectro photometrically \\nbecause the absorbance of 260 nm UV light by DNA increases during strand separation. \\nWhen a DNA sample is slowly heated, the absorbance increases as hydrogen bonds \\nare broken and reaches a plateau when all the DNA has become single stranded. The \\nmelting point of the rising curve gives the melting temperature, a direct measure of \\nthe G + C content. Since the density of DNA also increases linearly with G + C content, \\nthe percent G + C can be obtained by centrifuging DNA in a Caesium chloride density'),\n",

This method can be used because the density of DNA is also a function of \\n(G + C): (A + T) ratio. \\nThe G + C content of the nuclear DNA of major groups of organism has been \\nstudied. In both plants and animals the ranges are relatively narrow and quiet similar, \\naverges around 40% and ranges between 30 -50%. However in prokaryotic microorganism \\nthe G + C content is highly variable ranging from around 25 to almost 80%. For example, \\nvarious Streptococci, Pneumococci and Lactobacilli have a similar value (38-40%) which \\nhave been traditionally grouped together as lactic acid bacteria (because of their \\ncharacteristic fermentation). The G + C content of strains within a particular species \\nis constant. If two organisms differ in their G + C content by more than about 10%, \\ntheir genomes have quite different base sequences. \\nTaxonomically these G + C data are valuable for at least two reasons: \\n-¢- They can confirm a taxonomic scheme developed using other data. If organisms \\nin the same taxon are too dissimilar, in G + C content the taxon probably should \\nbe divided. \\n-¢- The G + C content appears to be useful in characterizing prokaryotic genera \\nsince the variation within a genus is usually less than 10% even though the \\ncontent may vary greatly between genera. For example Staphylococcus has a \\nG + C content of 30 - 38% whereas MicroccocllS DNA has 64 to 75% G + C, \\nyet these two genera of gram positive cocci have many other features in \\ncommon. \\nNucleic Acid Hybridization \\nThe similarity between genomes can be compared more directly by use of nucleic \\nacid hybridization studies. This includes DNA-DNA homology or DNA base sequence \\nand RNA sequences. If a mixture of single stranded DNA (formed by heating of ds \\nDNA) is cooled and held at a temperature about 25°C below the Tm, strands with \\ncomplementary base sequences will reassociate to form stable dsDNA, and the non \\ncomplementary strands will remain single. Incubation at 10-15°C below the Tm permits \\nhybrid formation day with almost identical strands. \\nThe most widely used hybridization techniques include nitro-cellulose filters which \\nbounds nonradioactive DNA strands are incubated at the appropriate temperature with \\nsingle stranded DNA fragments made radioactive with 32P, 3H or 14C. After radioactive \\nfragments are allowed to hybridize with the membrane bounds single stranded DNA, \\nthe membrane is washed to remove any non hybridized single stranded DNA and its \\nradioactivity is measured. The quantity of radioactivity bound to the filter reflects the \\namount of hybridization and thus the similarity of the DNA sequences. The degree of \\nhomology is expressed as the percent of experimental DNA radioactivity retained on \\nthe filter compared with the percent of homologue DNA radioactivity bound under the \\nsame conditions. Two strains whose DNA's show at least 70% relatedness under optimal \\nhybridization conditions and less than a 5% difference in Tm is often considered as \\nmembers of the same species. However DNA preparation from two unrelated bacteria, \\ncould not hybridise or they will not form a stable detectable hybrid. Therefore DNA-\"),\n",

More useful for \\ntaxonomic purposes are sequences of larger molecules such as 16S or 18S rRNA. Carl \\nWoese was the first who initiated studies on the phylogeny of 16SRNA. He digested \\n16SRNA with a specific endonuclease producing a variety of short oligonucleotide which \\nwere separated and sequenced. It was the finding that the 16SrRNA sequences of \\nmethanogens halophiles and thermoacidophiles were unexpectedly divergent from those \\nof other bacteria that allowed the recognition of archaebacteria as a distinctive \\nassemblage of bacteria. \\nThe methods deviced by Woese is as follows: radioactive 16S rRNA (obtained by \\ngrowing organisms in the presence of phosphate containing the radioactive isotope 32p) \\nis purified and digested with the endonuclease T l' This endonuclease cleaves the RNA \\non the 3' side of every guanosine residue hence a mixfure of oligonucleotides is obtained \\nthat range in size from a single nucleotide to a dozen or more, all containing a single \\nguanosine residue at the 3' terminus. These are now separated by two dimensional \\nelectrophoresis (the mixture is electrophoresed in one dimension in one buffer system, \\nthen in a second dimension in another buffer system) and their position determined \\nby autoradiography. The labelled oligonucleotides can then be removed and sequenced. \\nPractically only those with a chain length of five residues or more contain sufficient \\ntaxonomic information to be worth cataloguing. Oligonucleotide catalogues of a number \\nof organism are analysed with the help computer program, which compares them in \\na pairwise fashion and result can be displayed as a dendrogram. \\nA detailed analysis of 16SrRNA oligonucleotide catalogues or complete sequences \\nreveals that there are both, quiet variable and highly conserved regions of the molecule, \\nreflecting different degrees of functional constraint on different parts of the molecule. \\nSeparate comparison of the variable and conserved regions allows determination of both \\nclose and distant relationship.

Although they differ \\nin chemical detail, both rest on the same basic principle; a series of DNA fragments \\nare generated which have a common starting point, but variable termini (\"nested\" \\nfragments); by determining their exact length and the terminal base, the sequence can \\nbe inferred with great accuracy. Sanger method can be explain with an example. \\nIn order to determine the sequence of bases in a segment of DNA, a large number \\nof identical copies of it must be obtained. If the molecule that contains the sequence \\nis relatively small (e.g. a viral genome or a plasmid), one can feasibly sequence the \\nentire molecule. In such a case one need only separate the molecule from contaminating \\nnucleic a~id (e.g. fragments of the bacterial chromosome). If the sequence is part of a \\nmuch larger molecule, such as the bacterial chromosome, the usual approach is to clone \\nthe desired segment, and sequence a restriction fragment purified from the cloned DNA. \\nSince the Sanger method uses single-stranded DNA, the segment must either be digested \\nwith a nuclease to convert it to single-stranded DNA or, preferably, cloned in a single\\xad\\nstranded vector to begin with (bacteriophage M13). \\nSequencing of a purified single-stranded fragment is accomplished by generating \\na series of complementary nested fragments of DNA by incubating the fragment with \\nDNA polymerase, a short primer sequence complementary to a region of the fragment \\n(often a short restriction fragment itself), the four deoxy nucleoside triphosphates (one \\nor more of which are radioactive), and a small amount of one dideoxy nucleoside \\ntriphosphate (e.g. dideoxythymidine triphosphate). Chance incorporation of \\ndideoxythymidine, which lacks a 3\\' -hydroxyl group, terminates polymerization at that \\npoint. Thus, after a suitable incubation period, the mixture will contain radioactive DNA \\nstrands of variable length, all of which terminate in a thymidine residue. The number \\nof classes of DNA molecules, differing from each other in length, depends on the number \\nof thymidine residues, since for every thymidine residue in the new strand, there will \\nbe a family of radioactive DNA molecules that terminates at that point. \\nIn practice four parallel incubations are performed, identical except that each \\ncontains a different dideoxy nucleoside triphosphate, and hence will terminate at a \\ndifferent base. The mixture is then denatured and electrophoresed to separate the newly \\nsynthesized strands by size.

Each node \\nrepresent taxonomic units like species or genes. The external node those at the end of \\nthe branches represent living organism. The length of branches may represent the number \\nof molecular changes that takes place between the two nodes. Finally a tree can be rooted \\nor uprooted. The rooted tree gives a node that serves as the common ancestor and shows \\ndevelopment of the species from the root. It is a difficult task to develop a rooted tree. \\nIn contrast an unrooted tree simply represent a phylogenetic relationships but does not \\nprovide an evolutionary path. \\nThe Phylogenetic trees are developed by comparing molecular sequences. The first \\nstep to compare two molecules is to align there sequences so that similar parts match \\nup. The object is to align and compllre homologous sequences (once that are similar \\nbecause they had a common origin in the part). The computer plus complex mathematics \\nis employed to minimize the number of gaps and mismatches in the sequence is \\ncompared. \\nOnce the molecule is aligned the number of position that vary in the sequence \\ncan be determined and this data is used to calculate a measure of the differences between \\nthe sequences. The difference is expressed as the evolutionary distance. The evolutionary \\ndistance is a quantitative indication of the number of positions that differ between two \\naligned macromolecules. Statistical calculation is then made for back mutation and \\nmultiple substitution. In the next step the organism are then clustered together on the \\nbasis of similarity in the sequences. The most similar organism are then clustered together \\nand compared with the remaining organUim to form large duster associated together \\nat a lower level of similarity or evolutionary distance. This process is continued till all \\norganism are included in the tree. The another technique to estimate phylogenetic tree \\nis by parsimony analysis. Here the relationship are determined by estimating the \\nminimum number of sequence changes required to give the final sequences being \\ncompared. It is assumed that evolutionary changes occur along the shortest pathway \\nwith the fewest changes or steps from an ancestor to the organism in question. \\nrRNA, DNA AND PROTEIN AS INDICATORS OF PHYLOGENY \\nThe comparison of 165RNA isolated from various strains of prokaryote is of great \\nimportance in determining the phylogenetic relatedness then any other molecular \\ntechnique. The association coefficient or 5ab Value from rRNA studies is assumed to \\nbe a true measure of relatedness, the higher the 5ab value obtained from comparing \\ntwo organism, the more closely the organism are related to each other. If the sequence \\nof 165 rRNA of two organism are identical (5ab Value = 01). A group of prokaryote \\nthat branches off from other prokaryote long ago show a large range of 5ab value because \\nit has had more time to diversify than a group that developed more recently. Therefore \\nthe narrower the range of Sab value of a group of prokaryote the more modern it is. \\nAfter the determination of 5ab value the computer calculates the relatedness of the \\norganism and summarize its relationship in a tree or dendrogram. \\nThe 165rRNA of most major phylogenetic groups has one or more character sites'),\n",

These sequences are specific sequences which occur in most of all members \\nof a particular phylogenetic groups. They are rarely or never present in other groups \\neven of the closely related onces. Thus these sequences can be used to place the \\nmicroorganism in the proper group. These sequences has been identified for various \\norganism viz. bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and many other prokaryotic groups. \\nAlthough rRNA comparison are useful for the species level but DNA similarity \\nstudies are more effective in categorizing individual species and genera. These comparison \\ncan be carried out by using G + C content or hybridization studies. Like rRNA the \\nDNA composition of a cell does not change with growth conditions. The DNA \\ncompal'ison are based on complete genome rather than a fraction and precisely define \\na species based on 70% relatedness criteria. \\nCurrently many protein sequences are used to develop phylogenetic trees. This \\napproach has some advantages over rRNA comparisons. The sequence of 20 amino acids \\nhas more information persite than a sequences of four nucleotides. The protein sequences \\nare less affected by organism specific differences in G + C content than DNA and RNA \\nsequences and finally the protein sequence alignment is easier because it is not dependent \\non secondary structure as in an rRNA sequence. This approach involve some disadvantages \\nlike; indispensable protein with constant function do not change as rapidly whereas some \\nprotein like Ig evolve quiet rapidly. Thus all proteins are not suitable for studying large \\nscale change that occur over long periods. \\nSummary it is clear that sequences of all three macromolecules viz, rRNA, DNA \\nand proteins can provide valuable phylogenetic information but more molecular data \\nplus further study of phenotypic properties will help to resolve uncertainities. \\nNumerical Taxonomy: The earliest system of biological classification were based \\non arbitrarily chosen criteria and this classification was termed as artificial classification. \\nThe first such system of classification which was widely accepted was that given by \\nLinnaeus. Later when the fact of biological evolution was recognized another dimension \\nwas immediately added to the concept of natural or phentic classification. In the 19th \\ncentury the classification was based on the terms of evolutionary affinities and the \\ntaxonomic hierarchy in a certain sense become the reflection of a family tree and such \\na taxonomic system is called as phylogenetic system. \\nAn alternative approach for the classification is empirical one where the taxonomic \\narrangement is based on quantification of the similarities and differences among \\norganism. This was first suggested by a French biologist Michal Adansona and the \\nclassification is also named as Adansonian (or numerical) taxonomy. Here each \\nphenotypic character is given equal weighting, it should express numerically the \\ntaxonomic distances between organisms in terms of the number of characters they share, \\nrelative to the total number of characters examined. \\nThe process begins with a determination of the presence or absence of selected \\ncharacters in the group of organisms under study. Many characters at least 50 and \\npreferably several hundred should be compared for an accurate and reliable classification. \\nIt nlcludes many different kinds of data viz. morphological, biochemical and physiological.\"),\n",

Phylum : Planctomycetes (related to chlamydias according to rRNA sequences \\nit contain only one order (are coccoid to avoid or pear shaped that lack peptidoglycan, \\nnormally unicellular, divide by budding and may produce non prosthecate appendages \\ncalled stalks, grow in aquatic habitats.) Ex. - Isosphaera \\n2. Phylum: Chlamydiae (small phylum, obligate, intracellular parasite with unique \\nlife cycle involving two distinctive stages-elementary bodies and reticulate bodies, small \\ncoccid form with no appendages. Important pathogen and cause many human diseases). \\n3. Phylum Spirochaetes : (contain helically shaped, motile, gram - ve bacteria with \\nunique morphology and motility, chemoheterotroph, free living, symbiotic, parasitic. It \\nhas special exterior boundry the outer membrane that surrounds the protoplasmic \\ncylinder. Several important human pathogens). Ex. Spirochaetes \\n4. Phylum: Bacteroidetes - (it has three classes, Ex. - Bacteroides, Flavobacterium, \\nFlexibacter. ) \\nThus Bergey's manual is the principle resource in prokaryotic, taxonaomy and is \\nused by micro~iologists around the world. \\nFinally, it is emphasized that prokaryotic nomenclature is as much in flux as \\nclassification. The names of families and genera are fairly well established and stable \\nin the new system (At least in the absence of future discoveries). \\n000\"),\n",

The general characters of bacteria are: \\n1. They are omnipresent i.e. present in soil, air and water. \\n2. They are unicellular, prokaryotic microorganism. \\n3. The cell bears a thick rigid cell wall outside the plasma membrane (because \\nof this character they are kept in plant kingdom). \\n4.

It is \\nthe simplest form of bacteria in which bacteria appears like a minute sphere (0.5~ -\\n1.25~ in diameter) they lack flagella. On the basis of arrangements cocci are further \\nclassified as follows: \\n1. Micrococci: When a bacterium appears singly e.g. Micrococcus agitis, M. aureus. \\n2. Diplococcus: When they appear in a pairs of cells e.g. Diplococcus pneumoniae. \\n3. Streptococci: When they appear in rows of cells or in chains e.g. Streptocoocus \\nlactis. \\n4. Staphylococci: When they arrange in irregular clusters like bunches of grapes \\ne.g. Stapllyloccolls aureus. \\n5. Tetracoccus: When they arrange in a sequence of four e.g. Neisseria and \\nMicrocOCCIiS te trogen us. \\n6. Sarcinae: When they arrange in cuboidal or in a different geometrical or packet \\narrangements e.g. Sarcillae lutea. \\n(2) Rod Shaped Bacteria or Bacillus \\nThe word bacillus originated from greek word, bacillii means rod or stick. There \\nends are rounded flat or pointed. There size ranges from 0.5-1.2~ in diameter and 3-\\n7~ in length. They may be flagellated or non-flagellated. Most of the bacteria causing \\ndisease in plants belongs to bacilli category.

It is \\nbasically a polymer of N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG), N acetylmuramic acid (NAM), and \\n4 amino acids (L-alanine, D-alanine, D-glutamate and a diamino acids). \\nThe tetrapeptide of one peptidoglycan layer is cross linked with the other \\npeptidoglycan layer and as a result a strong framework is formed around the cell and \\nimpart great rigidity to the total structure. Some antibiotics viz. penicillin inhibit the \\nsynthesis of this framework thus the cell wall synthesis is stopped. \\nTetrapeptide side chain \\nPeptide cross bridge \\n__ --Carbohydrate \\n'backbone' \\nFig. 7 : General structure of peptidoglycan \\nWalls of Gram +ve and Gram -ve Bacteria \\nGram + ve bacteria have a much greater amount of peptidoglycan in their cell \\nwalls than do gram - ve bacteria.

It is hydrophilic and its main function is to transport positively charged \\nsubstances to the bacterial cell in the storage of phosphorous. Teichoic acid was \\ndiscovered by Baddiley (1933). \\nCell Wall of Gram Negative Bacteria \\nThe wall of gram - ve bacteria are more complex than those of gram + ve bacteria. \\nThe envelop of this kind of bacteria is made up of two unit membranes and are separated \\nby 100Ao space known as periplasmic region and contains a peptidoglycan layer. The \\noutermost membrane is known as cell wall while the inner one is referred as cytoplasmic \\nmembrane . Peptidoglycan is only about 5-10% of the dry weight of cell wall. The outer \\nmembrane serve as selective barrier for various external chemicals and enzymes that \\ncould damage the cells. Its structure is similar to plasma membrane or cell membrane. \\nThe outer membrane is anchored to the underlying peptidoglycan by means of Braun's \\nlipoprotein. The membrane is bilayered structure consisting mainly of phospholipids \\nprotein and lipopolysaccharide (L.P.S.). The phospholipids are bilayered consisting of \\nboth hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends. The wall contains 4 types of protein components \\nalong with other major types of protein called lipoprotein. \\nThe Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has toxic properties and is also known as endotoxin. \\nIt occurs only in the outer layer of the membrane and is composed of three covalently \\nlinked parts : \\n(i) Lipid A = firmly embedded in the membrane. \\n(ii) Core polysaccharide = located at the membrane surface. \\n(iii) O-antigens = which extend like whiskers from the membrane surface into the \\nsurrounding medium . Many antigenic properties of gram - ve bacteria are \\nattributable to O-antigens. \\nThe outer membrane is although impermeable to large molecules but can allow \\nsmaller molecules such as nucleosides, oligosaccharide, monosaccharides, pep tides and \\namino acids. This is accomplished by means of channels in special proteins called porins. \\nStructure Internal to Cell Wall \\nCytoplasmic Membrane: Immediate below the cell wall is cytoplasmic membrane \\nwhich is similar in both gram + ve and gram -ve bacteria. It is about 75 nm thick \\nbilayered membrane and is composed primarily of phospholipids (about 20-30%) and \\nproteins (about 60-70%) . The phospholipid form a bilayer in which most of the proteins \\nare tenaciously held (integral proteins). These protein only can be removed by \\ndestruction of the membrane or by the treatment with detergents. Other proteins are \\nloosely attached (peripheral proteins) and can be removed by mild treatment such \\nas osmotic shock. Each phospholipids molecule of the bilayer has both hydrophilic \\nhead facing outwards and a hydrophobic tail facing towards each other. The lipid \\nmatrix of the membrane has fluidity. This type of structure of plasma membrane is \\nknown as fluid mosaic model. \\nThe cytoplasmic membrane act as a hydrophobic barrier for the penetration of most\"),\n",

However specific proteins in the membrane facilitate the \\npassage of small molecules (nutrients and waste products) across the membrane. \\nThe cytoplasmic membrane also contains various enzymes involved in respiratory \\nmetabolism and in synthesis of capsular and cell wall components. \\nINTRACELLULAR MEMBRANE SYSTEM \\nMesosome : Bacterial cell do not contain membrane bound organelles (Viz. \\nmitochondria, chloroplast, golgi apparatus etc). But in bacteria the cytoplasmic \\nmembrane have specialized invagiantions that can increase their surface area for certain \\nfunction. \\nEspecially in gram positive bacteria these membrane invaginations are in the form \\nof convoluted tubules and vesicles termed mesomes. They are well developed in bacilli, \\nand may be 2-4 in number in each cell. Their number is higher in those bacteria involved \\nin higher respiratory activity e.g. Azatobacter. The mesosomes may be central or \\nperipheral in position. The central mesosome penetrate deeply into the cytoplasm and \\nlocated ncar the middle of the cell, and seemed to be attached to the genetic material \\nof the cell and thought to be involved in replication of DNA and cell division. While \\nthe peripheral mesosome show only a shallow penetration into the cytoplasm seem to \\nbe involved in export of exocellular enzymes such as penicillinase. \\nThe nature of mesosome was initially considered to be equivalent to mitochondria \\nof higher plants and considered to be pockets of respiratory activity since they lack \\nouter membrane they are not considered analogous to mitochondria. Along with this \\nit is also devoid of many plasma membrane enzymes viz. ATPase, dehydrogenase, \\nand cytochrome. It has been suggested that mesosomes help in the formation of septum. \\nRibosomes : Ribosomes are found in free floating conditions and are randomoly \\ndistributed in the cytoplasm. They constitute about 30% of the total weight of the \\nbacterium (10,000 -15000 ribosome in a bacterial cell). During protein synthesis a number \\nof ribosomes are held together by mRNA and form polyribosomes. The number of \\nribosome is directly proportional to the rate of protein synthesis. \\nThe ribosome of prokaryote are of 70s type whose molecular weight is about \\n2.7 million. Each 70s ribosome is composed of two subunits larger 50S and a smaller \\n30S. At low concentration of Mg+2 ions these 70S ribosome is dissociated into its two \\nsubunits. \\nRibosome of E. coli bacteria is made up of 63% RNA and 37% protein or they \\nare in 2:1 ratio. Many antibiotics like streptomycin and tetracycline who inhibit the \\nprotein synthesis in bacterial cell have a main target on the ribosome of the bacterium. \\nLamellae or Chromatophore : Lamellar thylakoid or vesicles are found in many \\nphotosynthetic bacteria. They are known as chromatophores. Lamellae are synthesized \\nby two unit membranes. These membranes are distributed throughout the cytoplasm. \\nThese chromatophore are hollow rounded structure with a diameter of about 300A 0. \\nThey bears photosynthetic pigments, enzyme required for light reaction, ETS system \\nof photophosphorylation. They lack the enzyme required for dark reaction.'),\n",

Generally the bacteria are classified \\nin two nutritional types on the basis of their nutrition requirement: \\n, (1) Autotrophic (2) Heterotrophic \\n(1) Autotrophic \\nA very small group of bacteria possess this type of nutrition. Few bacteria possess \\nphotosynthetic pigment bacteriochlorophyll other than normal chlorophyll found in \\nhigher plants are called photosynthetic bacteria. Thus autotrophic bacteria are of two \\ntypes: \\n(i) Photosynthetic bacteria (ii) Chemosynthetic bacteria \\n(I) Photosynthetic Bacteria \\nThis type of bacteria possess a special type of pigment called bacteriochlorophyll. \\nAlong with this other pigment viz. BactE~riviridin or chlorobium chlorophyll is also found. \\nThese pigments are found on spiral structures called chromatophores. Like other higher \\ngreen plants they synthesize carbohydrate by the fixation of atmospheric CO 2, Generally \\nthis fixation process occur in the presence of sulphur compounds which is mainly H 2S \\n(hydrogen sulphide). Therefore it can be said that hydrogen sulphide is main hydrogen \\nsource in photosynthesis in bacteria and here sulphur is produced as byproduct in place \\nof oxygen (produced in higher plants) in the chemical reaction. \\nThe chemical reaction of photosynthesis is as follows \\nCO 2 + H 2S ~ (CH 20)n + 2S + H 20 + energy \\ne.g. Chromatium, Chlorobium and Chlorobacterium \\n(II) Chemosynthetic Bacteria \\nMany bacteria uses the energy released from different type of chemical reactions \\nfor the conversion of carbon dioxide into carbohydrate (because they cannot utilize the \\nphoto energy due to lack of chlorophyll). Therefore they use the energy released from \\nthe oxidation of certain substances sulphur and its compound. Ammonia, Nitrites, Iron, \\nHydrogen, Carbon monoxide, methane are certain chemical substances whose oxidation \\nis carried out by certain bacteria and the energy released is used by these bacteria for \\nthe synthesis of food. The important chemosynthetic bacteria are as follows: \\n(i) Sulphur Bacteria : The example of sulphur bacteria are Thiobacillus, Beggiatoa \\nand Thiothrix.

No sexual reproduction was reported by many microbiologist but electron \\nmicroscopic study reports the unidirectional genetic recombination among certain \\nbacteria. \\nReproduction in bacteria includes the following methods \\n(i) Vegetative reproduction \\nIt includes the following types \\n(1) Binary fission \\n(2) Budding \\n(3) Cyst \\n(4) Gonidia or segmentation \\n(1) Binary fission \\nThe most common and most important mode of cell division which occur in bacteria \\nwhen the environmental factor such as light, moisture, temperature are favourable is \\ntransverse binary fission. In this a single cell divides after developing a transverse septum \\n(cross wall). Bacilli and spiral bacteria divide along the longitudinal axis of the cell while \\nin coccus this division can be on any axis. Mesosomes play an important role in binary \\nfission. Binary fission occurs in following steps: \\n(a) Division of nuclear or genetic material : When bacterial cell attains its \\nmaximum size, it generally increase longitudinally. After that its circular DNA undergo \\nreplication and results into two DNA components. This replication is of semi conservative \\ntype. Now these two DNA moves to two opposite poles with the help of mesosomes. \\nBecause no spindle fibres are formed during this entire process, this division is known \\nas amitosis. \\n(b) Division of cytoplasm and septum formation: By the end of the division of \\nnuclear material, the cytoplasmic membrane start invagination in the middle of the cell.'),\n",

This constriction continuously \\ndeepens and results into two daughter cells. Under favourable conditions a single binary \\nfission is completed within 18-20 minutes. But such a rapid rate of cell division cannot \\ncontinue for a long time because the rapid iPcrease in growth rate of bacterial population \\nis inhibited due to following reasons : \\n1. Lack of space, food, water, oxygen other salts and accumulation of their own \\nharmful waste products in the medium. \\n2. Environmental factors like light, temperature, moisture becomes unfavourable. \\n3. Death due to senescence and sometimes they are eaten by microscopic animals \\nand viruses. \\nTherefore survival rate of bacteria in nature is only 1 %. \\n(2) Budding \\nIn this type of process the bacterial cell wall gets thinned at the end of cell, and \\nit develops a cytoplasmic growth or protuberance which is covered by thin membrane. \\nThis structure is known as bud.

They are produced under conditions of limited supply of carbon, nitrogen \\nand phosphorous. This process was first of all reported by Cohn (1817) and late by \\nKoch (1877). Endospores are generally formed in bacteria pathogenic to plants, animals \\nand human beings. Endospores are heat, chemical, drying, freezing and radiation \\nresistant bodies. They can survive under dormancy even upto 50 years and on getting \\nfavourable environmental conditions they may germinate to start a new bacterial \\nlife. \\nEndospores are found in bacteria like Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporolactobacillus, \\nSporosarcina and Desulfotomaclllu111. \\nGenerally a single cell transform into a single endospore but in certain cases two \\nendospores are also reported from a single cell. They may be oval, ellipsoidal or spherical \\nin shape and usually in central, terminal or sub-terminal in position. \\nThus endospore is a highly resistant structure.

In the presence of RNA polymerase enzyme \\nthis gene synthesize a special protein which initiate the formation of endospore in the \\ncell. \\nFitz-James & Young (1969) studied the process of formation of endospore in \\nClostridium Electron microscopically This can be divided into six main steps which are \\nas follows: \\n(1) 0 Stage: In this stage the cell which is going to form endospore, enlarges in \\nsize and its chromatin material condenses attain the shape of an axial filament reaching \\nfrom one end to the another end of the cell. \\n(2) I Stage: Axial filament develop completely. There is a change in the metabolic \\nactivity of the cell. \\n(3) II Stage: The plasma membrane start invaginating towards the one end of the \\ncell. This invagination grows centripetally and both the end unite to form a spore septum. \\nSeptum formation ends by the formation of a small spore known as fore spore. The \\ngenetic material also get transported to this structure. \\n(4) III Stage : Spore septum of both i.e. mother cell and fore spore grows around \\nthe protoplasm of fore spore by a process called engulfment. Thus fore spore lies freely \\nin the cytoplasm of mother cell. \\n(5) IV Stage : Cell wall of peptidoglycan is synthesized outside the plasma \\nmembrane of fore spore. This structure is called as spore wall. \\n(6) V Stage: There is a deposition of peptidoglycan cortex between the spore wall \\nand cell membrane. The protoplasm condenses and synthesize dipiconilic acid whose \\ndeposition occurs on cell membrane. There is an increase in the concentration of Ca +2, \\narginine and glutamic acid in the spore cytoplasm. Spore wall become multilayered. \\n(7) VI Stage : The spore mature into spore mother cell, the mother cell is called \\nas sporangium. \\n(8) VII Stage : There is autolysis of sporangium and the spore is released free \\nin the environment and it is transmitted by air.'),\n",

Generalized transduction \\n2. Specialized transduction. \\n1. Generalized Transduction : It is completed in following steps: \\n(1) This type of transduction starts with the infection of bacteria with the \\nbacteriophage. This process is controlled by the DNA segments called as \\nprophage particle present in the cytoplasm of bacterial cell. \\n(2) During the infection of the lysosgenic bacterial cell by bacteriophage, the DNA \\nof the bacteria breaks down into small fragments and the nucleic acid of the \\nbacteriophage utilizes the bacterial enzymes and synthesize new phage \\ncomponents. \\n(3) At the same time when these progeny phage particles are form the DNA \\nfragments of the bacteria incorporate into these DNA particles of the phage. \\n(4) The genetic material or DNA fragments of the previous bacterial cell is \\ntransferred to the new bacterial cell infected by these progeny phage particles. \\nThus generalized transduction is the process where bacterio phage plays an active \\nrole in the transfer of DNA fragments of the bacterial cell. \\n2. Specialized Transduction: Andre Lwoff et al. (1953) reported that ceitain \\nbacterial strains are able to survive for a long time even after infected by the \\nbacteriophage and these is no lysis of bacterial cell. Here in these bacteria there is a \\njoining of bacterial DNA with the phage DNA and both DNA i.e. bacterial DNA and \\nphage DNA replicate commonly. This bacteria is known as lysogenic bacteria and the \\nphage is called as prophage. \\nThis bacterial celIs can survive in lysogenic stage for many generations which is \\ndue to the synthesis of a special repressor protein. This protein inhibits the synthesis \\nof phage particle inside the bacterial cell. As the synthesis of this protein is stopped \\nthe bacterial cell start the synthesis of phage components. \\nThe DNA of both i.e. of phage DNA and bacterial DNA break~ down before the \\nsynthesis of the phage particles starts. At the same time some bacterial genes are carried \\nout by phage DNA and replicate with the phage DNA. These resultant progeny phage \\nparticles are entirely different from the parent one when these progeny phage particles \\ninfect a new bacterial cell, some of the gene (of the previous bacterial cell) are also \\ntransmitted to the newly infected bacterial cell. In this type of transduction only those \\nspecial genes are transmitted which are attached very closely to the phage DNA.'),\n",

This technique was introduced by Christian Gram \\n(1884). In this process the fixed bacterial smear is subjected to the following staining \\nreagents in the order, crystal violet, iodine solution, alcohol (decolorizing agent), and \\nsafranin. Bacteria stained by the gram method fall into two groups: Gram positive \\nbacteria which retain the crystal violet and hence appear deep violet in color, and gram \\n-ve bacteria which loses the crystal violet and counterstained by safranin and hence \\nappear pink in colour. \\nThe most plausible explanation for this phenomenon are associated with the \\nstructure and composition of the cell wall. The cell wall of gram negative bacteria is \\ngenerally thinner than those of gram positive bacteria. Gram negative bacteria contain \\na· higher percentage of lipid than do Gram p~sitive bacteria. During staining of gram \\nnegative bacteria the alcohol treatment extracts the lipid which results in increased \\nporosity or permeability of the cell wall.

These cells subsequently \\ntake on the color of the safranin counterstain. The cell wall of gram positive bacteria, \\nbecause of their different composition (lower lipid content), become dehydrated during \\ntreatment with alcohol. The pore size decreases, permeability is reduced and the \\nCV-I complex can't be extracted. There for these cells remain purple violet. \\nAnother explanation is also based on permeability differences between the two \\ngroups of bacteria. In gram positive bacteria, the CV-I complex is trapped iD. the wall \\nfollowing the ethanol treatment which presumably causes a diminution in the diameter \\nof the pores in the cell wall peptidoglycan. Walls of gram negative bacteria have a very \\nmuch smaller amount of peptidoglycan, which is less extensively cross-linked than that \\nin the walls of gram positive bacteria. The pores in the peptidoglycan of gram negative \\nbacteria remain sufficiently large even after ethanol treatment to allow the CV-I complex \\nto be extracted. \\nThe two explanations, both contribute to the explanation of the'mechanism of the \\ngram stain. Furthermore if gram positive cells are treated with lysozyme (an enzyme) \\nto remove the cell wall, the resulting structure called protoplast will be stained by the \\nCV - I complex. However they are easily decolarized by alcohol.

According to regressive theory of evolution put forward by \\nLwoff, some primitive microorganism (like bacteria) become endoparasitic on some host \\nand gradually lost synthetic enzymes to become today's viruses.

The bacilli form particles of Agaricus bisporous is the only fungal virus reported \\nthat contains ssRNA. \\nDEFINITION \\nVirion: A single infective particle of virus is called as virion. It consists of nucleic \\nacid core surrounded by a protein coat or capsid. The capsid with enclosed nucleic acid \\nis called nucleocapsid. \\nViroids: These are the smallest infectious agents causing diseases in host. They \\nconsist solely of a protein free low molecular weight (75,000 - 1,25,000 dalton) with \\n243-360 nucleotides and small fragments of double stranded RNA molecules. They are \\nalso known as naked virus, meta virus or pathogene. \\nEvidence shows that viroids replicate by direct RNA copying in which all components \\nrequired for viroid replication including RNA polymerase are provided by the host. During \\nviroid replication, the circular (+) strand of the viroid is replicated while it acts as a rolling \\ndrum producing multimeric linear strands of (-) RNA. The linear (-) strand then serves \\nas a template for replication of multimeric strand (+) of RNA. The (+) RNA is subsequently \\nprocessed (cleaved) by enzymes that release linear, unit length viroid (+) RNA's which \\ncircularize and produce many copies of the original viroid RNA. \\nViroids apparently interfere with the host metabolism in ways resembling those \\nof viruses but of what way is still unclear. It has been shown that both virus specific \\nRNA's synthesized during infection and viroid RNA in vitro activate a protien kinase \\nenzyme, which in turn activates other cellular enzymes while it impedes the initiation \\nof protein synthesis. As viroid strain that cause mild to severe plant symptoms activate \\nthe protein kinase more than 10 times as much as mild strains, it is possible that \\nactivation of the protein kinase represents the triggering event in viroid pathogenesis \\nand in disease development by the plant. \\nViroids are spreaded from diseased to healthy plants primarily by mechanical \\nmeans, i.e. sap carried through hands or tools during cultural practices while some are \\ntransmitted by pollen and seed. \\nViroids survive in nature outside the host or in dead plant matter for periods of \\ntime from few minutes to few months. They are quiet resistant to high temperature \\nand can't be inactivated in infected plant by Heat treatment. \\nThe control of diseases caused by viroids is based on the use of viroid-free \\npropagating stock, removal and destruction of viroid infected plants and washing of \\nhands or sterlizing of tools after handling viroid infected plants before moving on to \\nhealthy plants. \\nPotato spindle tuber viroid (PSTvd) is the first recognized viroid, which consist \\nof 359 nucleotides under E.M. Purified PSTvd appears as short strands about 40 nm \\nlong and has the thickness of a dsDNA. \\nViroids seem to be associated with cell nuclei particularly the chromatin and \\npossibly with the endomembrane system of the cell. \\nIt was first discovered by Diener (1971) as the causal agent of potato spindle tuber \\ndisease. Other viroid caused disease reported so far are-tomato bunchy top disease,\"),\n",

They do not show any metabolic activity except \\n(multiplication) self-duplication that too only within the host cytoplasm. Viruses require \\nspecific host cells for their multiplication. \\nTwo different types of life cycles are exhibited by bacteriophage, virulent or lytic \\ncycle and temperate or lysogenic cycle. In the former the intracellular phage multiplication \\nresults in the lyses or disintegration of the cell of the host bacterium and then final \\nrelease of the progeny virions. In later no harm is caused to the cell of the host bacterium \\nand the nucleic acid of the virus is first inserted in the bacterial (host) DNA and then \\nreplicates along with bacterial DNA. Bacteria containing prophages are called lysogenic \\nbacteria and those viruses whose nucleic acid can become prophage (i.e. gets incorporated \\nin bacterial DNA) are known as lysogenic, temperate or avirulent phages (eg. F2, M 12). \\nLytic or Virulent Cycle \\nThe major events involved in the lytic cycle of T -even phages are: \\n(1) Attachment of phage particle to the host. \\n(2) Adsorption of virus particle. \\n(3) Penetration into the host. \\n(4) Replication of viral nucleic acid. \\n(5) Protein synthesis. \\n(6) Assembly of new virions. \\n(7) Release of mature viruses \\n(1) Attachment to the host: Random collision brings the phage particles in contact \\nwith the bacterial cells. The tail plate of the phage attaches to the surface of a susceptible \\nhost bacterium along with tail fibres. Specific components of the protein capsid are \\nknown to be involved in the process of attachment of the virus to a specific receptor \\nsites of the host bacterial cell. In E.coli such sites are located in outer lipoprotein layer \\nof peptidoglycan layer. \\n(2) Adsorption: When the contact is made between tail fibres and bacterium, it \\nbecomes unfolded from the tail. Unfolding and release of tail fibres from whiskers are \\ngoverned by certain co-factors for ego tryptophan is needed (1 mgl ml). The whole process \\nof interaction of phage to recognition of specific receptor site is known as landing (A) \\nAfter landing there starts the second process of adsorption which is known as pinning \\n(B).

The base plate through the centre enlarges after contraction of sheath. \\nAfter making the contact with a component of plasma membrane, unplugging of phage \\nDNA begins (E). Thereafter, DNA is injected into the cell without requiring metabolic \\nenergy. (F) Phage head and tail remain outside the cell. Such empty protein coats are \\nknown as 'ghosts'. \\nThe adsorption of the virus particles is a specific process for which the presence \\nof some cations is necessary.

It causes \\nthe hollow core of the phage tail to pierce through the bacterial cell wall and possibly \\nthe plasma membrane. At this stage the contractile tail sheath functions like a muscle. \\nIt derives the energy from ATP present in the tail of the phage. Through the hollow \\ncore of the contracted tail the phage DNA is injected or penetrated into the body of \\nthe bacterium.

This is accomplished by the synthesis of viral specific m-RNA. The replication \\nof phage DNA follows the semi conservative mechanism. Most of the phage DNA serves \\nas a template in its own synthesis and the rest is used as a template for the synthesis \\nof viral specific m-RNA. The later directs the host cell to synthesize proteins which are \\nused as a subunits (capsomeres) of the protein coat of the phage particle. These protein \\nare called late proteins as mentioned above. After the penetration of phage DNA some \\nenzyme are first synthesized. These enzymes are necessary for building complex \\nmolecule peculiar to the phage, and represent early proteins. Subsequently, late proteins \\nappear, which include the protein subunits of head and tail of the bacteriophage.\"),\n",

The packaging mechanism of T4 DNA involves cutting a \\nsegment of DNA from the concatemer sufficient to fill a phage head (at least one genomic \\nequivalent) rather than cutting the DNA at a specific sequence. Since the T4 head holds \\nslightly more than a genome length, this 'headful mechanism' leads to circular permutation \\nand terminal redundancy. T4 DNA contains the modified base 5-hydroxymethy1cystosine \\ninstead of cytosine. It is these residues that are glucosylated and DNA with this \\nmodification is resistant to virtually all known restriction enzymes. Consequently, the \\nincoming T4 DNA is well protected from host defenses. The multiplication cycle of these \\nphages like that all viruses (as mentioned in chap 9) can be divided into five distinct \\nstages viz. attachment, penetration, biosynthesis, maturation and release. \\nMultiplication in T4 Phage \\nThings happen rapidly in a T4 infection. \\nEarly in infection T4 directs the synthesis of its \\nown RNA and also begins to replicate its unique \\nDNA.

Transcription from the late promoters requires a new T4- encoded sigma \\nfactor. Sequential modification of host cell RNA polymerase as described here for phage \\nT4 is used to regulate gene expression by many other bacteriophages as well. \\nT4 encodes over 20 new proteins that are synthesized early aft.er infection. These \\ninclude enzymes for the synthesis of the unusual base 5-hydroxymethykytosine and for \\nits glucoslyation, as well as an enzyme that degrades the normal DNA precursor \\ndeoxycytidine triphosphate. In addition, T4 encodes a number of enzymes that have \\nfunctions similar to those of host enzymes in DNA replication but that are formed in larger \\namounts, thus permitting faster synthesis of T4 specific DNA. Additional early proteins \\ninclude those involved in the processing of newly replicated phage DNA. \\nMost of the late genes encode structural proteins for the virion, including those for \\nthe head and tail. Assembly of heads and tails occurs independently; DNA is packaged \\ninto the assembled head and the tail and tail fibers are added later. Exit of the virus from \\nthe cell occurs as a result of cell lysis. The phage codes for a lytic enzyme, T4 lysozyme, \\nwhich attacks the peptidoglycan of the host cell. After a lytic cycle, which takes only about \\n25 min, over 100 new virions will be released from each host cell, which itself has now \\nbeen almost completely destroyed. The various stages involved in the multiplication of \\nphages can be demonstrated experimentally in what is known as a one-step growth \\nexperiment. In this procedure, a phage suspension is diluted until a sample containing \\nonly a few phage particles is obtained. These particles are then introduced into a culture \\nof host cells. Periodically samples of phage particles are removed from the culture are \\ninoculated into a plate culture of susceptible host cells, the plaque method is used to \\ndetermine the number of infective phage particles on this culture. A few minutes after \\nattachment no infective particles are present. However phage nucleic acid is found inside \\nthe infected cells and capsid proteins will be synthesized. The time required for maturation \\nis the interval between the appearance of phage nucleic acid and the synthesiS of mature \\nphages.

The burst size is determined once the number of infective phage particles \\nremains constant indicating that no further phage multiplication will occur. \\nTEMPERATE BACTERIOPHAGES \\nBacteriophages T4 is virulent. However, some other viruses, although also able to \\nkill cells through a lytic cycle, have the option of undergoing a different life cycle resulting \\nin a stable genetic relationship with the host. Such viruses are called temperate viruses. \\nThese viruses can enter into a state called lyosgeny, where most virus genes are not \\nexpressed and the virus genome, called a prophage, is replicated in synchrony with the \\nhost chromosome. \\nThe temperate phage genome can be replicated along with that of the host and during \\ncell division be passed from one generation to the next. Under certain conditions cells that \\nharbor a temperate virus, called lysogens, can spontaneously produce and release virions. \\nLysogeny is probably of ecological importance because most bacteria isolated from \\nnature are lysogens for one or more bacteriophages.

Rather it is expression \\nof the viral genome that is deleterious. Host cells can harbor viral genomes without harm \\nif the expression of the viral genes can be controlled. This is the situation found in \\nlysogens. However, if this control is lost, the virus enters the lytic pathway and produces \\nnew virions, eventually lysing the host cell. Lysogeny can thus be considered a genetic \\ntrait of a bacterial strain. \\nThe temperate virus does not exist in its extracellular form inside of the cell. Instead, \\nthe prophage is integrated into the bacterial chromosome and replicates along with the \\nhost cell as long as the genes controlling its lytic pathway are not expressed. Typically \\nthis control is maintained by a phage-encoded repressor protein (the gene encoding the \\nrepressor protein is expressed). The virus repressor protein not only controls the lytic genes \\non the prophage but also prevents the expression of any incoming genes of the same virus. \\nThis results in the lysogens having immunity to infection by the same type of virus. \\nIf the phage repressor is inactivated or if its synthesis is prevented, the prophage \\nis induced. Induction results in the production of new virions and the lysis of the host \\ncell. In some cases, induction can be brought about by environmental conditions. If the \\nvirus loses the ability to leave the host genome (because of mutation), it becomes a cryptic \\nvirus.

PHAGE \\nOne of the best-studied temperate phages is lambda, which infects Escherichia coli. \\nMorphologically, lambda virions look like those of many other tailed bacteriophages\" \\nalthough unlike phage T4, no tail fibers are present. The genome of lambda consists of \\na linear double-stranded DNA molecule, but at the 5\\' terminus of each of the strands \\nis a single-stranded tail 12 nucleotides long. These single-stranded ends are complementary \\n(the ends of the DNA are said to be cohesive). Thus, when the two\\' ends of the DNA \\nare free in the host cell they associate (the cos site), and the DNA is ligated to form a \\ndouble-stranded circle of 48,502 base pairs. \\nLambda Infection and the Lytic Pathway \\nThe lambda virion attaches to a specific receptor protein in the cell wall of Escherichia \\ncoli and injects its DNA. The DNA circularizes almost immediately and expression of the \\nphage genome begins. The first steps in gene expression are the same whether the final \\nresult is lysis or lysogeny. This replication shows an interesting example of molecular level \\ncontrol of gene expression. The completion of rightward transcription of the phage genome \\nrequires the expression of Q gene expression. The complete counter clock wise transcription \\nof the lambda genome requires the expression of the N gene that codes for an N protein. \\nBoth the N and Q genes must be expressed for the transcription of the complete genome. \\nThe A. phage genome contains a a gene which codes for a repressor protein that binds \\nto the operator that controls the expression of N protein. In the absence of N protein synthesis \\nthe replication of A. phage DNA can\\'t proceed.

Negative control is by means of the formation of proteins that stop host \\nRNA polymerase and shut off early T7 gene transcription. Positive control is by the \\nformation of new RNA polymerase that recognizes the rest of the T7 promoters. \\nA structural feature of T7 DNA that is important for its replication is a direct terminal \\nrepeat of 160 bp at both ends of the molecule. To replicate DNA near the 5' terminus, \\nRNA primer molecules have to be removed before replication is complete. There is thus \\nan unreplicated portion of the T7 DNA at the 5' -terminus of each strand. Genetic elements \\ncomposed of linear DNA employ various strategies for solving this problem in DNA \\nreplication. The strategy employed by T7 is similar to that used by T4 and involves the \\nrepeated sequence at its ends. The opposite single 3' -strands on two separate DNA \\nmolecules, being complementary, can pair with these 5' -strands, forming a DNA molecule \\ntwice as long as the original T7 DNA. The unreplicated portions of this structure are \\nthen completed through the activity of T7 DNA polymerase and ligase, resulting in a linear \\nbirnolecule called a concatemer. \\nContinued replication & recombination can lead to concatemers of considerable \\nlength, but ultimately a phage-encoded endonuclease cuts each concatemer at a specific \\nsite, resulting in the formation of virus-sized linear DNA molecules with terminal repeats. \\nBecause T7, like lambda but unlike T4, cuts the concatemer at specific sequences, the DNA \\nsequence in each T7 virion is identical.

This is because both ends of the Mu genome contain host DNA. At the left \\nend of the Mu DNA are 50-150 bp of host DNA, and at the right end are 1-2 kbp of \\nhost DNA. These host DNA sequences are not unique but simply represent DNA adjacent \\nto the location where Mu was inserted into the genome of its previous host. \\nWhen a Mu phage virion is formed, a length of DNA containing the Mu genome \\njust large enough to fill the phage head is excised from the host. The DNA is packaged \\nuntil the head is full, but the place at the right end where the DNA is cut varies from \\none virion to another, there is a variable sequence of host DNA at the right-hand end \\nof the phage (right of the attR site). Thus, each virion arising from a single infected cell \\nwill be genetically unique, since it will have different host DNA. \\nA specific segment of the Mu genome called G is invertible, being present in the \\ngenome either in the orientation designated G+ or in the inverted orientation G. The \\norientation of this segment determines the kind of tail fibers that are present on the phage. \\n5ince adsorption to the host cell is controlled by molecular interactions between the tail \\nfibers and the cell surface, the host range of Mu is determined by which orientation of \\nthis invertible segment is present in the phage. For example, if the G segment is in the \\norientation designated G+, then the phage will make tail fibers that allow it to infect \\nEscherichia coli strain K12. By contrast, if the G segment is in the G- orientation, then the \\nphage will infect E. coli strain C or several other species of enteric bacteria. The two tail \\nfiber proteins are encoded on opposite strands within this small G segment. \\nLeft of the G segment is a promoter that directs transcription into the G segment. \\nIn the orientation G+, the promoter directing transcription of genes 5 and V is active, \\nwhereas in the orientation G-, a different promoter directs transcription of genes 5' and \\nV' on the opposite strand.

At the site where the Mu \\nDNA becomes integrated, a 5-bp duplication of host DNA arises at the target site. This \\nhost DNA duplication arises because staggered cuts are made at the point in the host \\ngenome where Mu is inserted. The resulting single-stranded segments are converted to \\nthe double-stranded form as part of the Mu integration process.

In transverse section the elongated viruses appear as hollow tubes \\nwith the protein subunits forming the outer coat and the nucleic acid, also spirally \\narranged, embedded between the inner ends of two successive spirals of the protein \\nsubunits. The rhabdoviruses and a few spherical viruses are provided with an outer \\nlipoprotein envelope or membrane. Inside the membrane is the nucleocapsid consisting \\nof nucleic acid and protein subunits. The nucleic acid makes up 5-40% of the virus protein \\nmaking up the remaining 60-95%. The spherical virus contain higher percentage of nucleic \\nacid whereas the low nucleic acid percentage is found in elongated virus. The weight \\nof nucleic acid ranges between 1-3 x 106 dalton per virus particle. Although some have \\n6 x 106 dalton. All viral nucleic acid sizes are quiet small as compared, to 0.5 x 109 dalton \\nfor mollicutes and 1.5 x 109 dalton for bacteria. \\nThe protein shell of plant viruses are composed of repeating sub-units. The amino \\nacid content and sequence for identical protein subunits of a given virus are constant \\nbut vary for different viruses and even for different strains of the same virus. The content \\nand sequences of amino acids are known for the proteins of many viruses. For example \\nthe protein subunit of TMV consist of 158 amino acids in a constant sequence with a \\nmass of 17,600 dalton. \\nThe protein subunits of TMV are arranged in a helix containing 16, 1/3 subunits \\nper turn (49 subunits per three turns). Each TMV particle consists of approximately 130 \\nhelix turn of protein subunits. The nucliec acid is packed tightly between the helices of \\nprotein subunits. In rhabdovirus the helical nucleoproteins are enveloped in a membrane. \\nIn polyhedral plant viruses the protein, subunits are tightly packed in arrangement \\nthat produce 20 facets and form a shell. In this shell the nucleic acid is folded or otherwise \\norganized. \\nThe nucleic acid of most plant viruses consists of RNA but about 80 viruses are known \\nto contain DNA. Both nucleic acid either DNA or RNA are long chain like molecules \\nconsisting of hundreds/thousands of units called nucleotides. The size of both RNA and \\nDNA is expressed either as Dalton or as the number of bases (Kb for ssRNA and DNA \\nor kilobase pairs (Kbp) for double stranded RNA and DNA. Most plant viruses contain \\n(540) ssRNA, but 40 contain dsRNA, 30 contain dsDNA and about 50 contain ssDNA. \\nSATELLITE VIRUS AND SATELLITE RNA \\nThe satellite viruses are virus that must always be associated with certain typical \\nviruses (helper viruses) because they depend upon the later for multiplication and plant \\ninfection. Satellite virus reduce the ability of the helper viruses to multiply and cause \\ndisease i.e. satellite virus act like parasites of the associated helper virus. \\nThe satellite RNA are small, linear, circular RNAs found inside the virion of certain \\nmulti component viruses.

Then the virus moves from cell to cell through plasmodes\\xad\\nmata, connecting the adjacent cells. Viruses multiply in each parenchyma cells infected. \\nIn leaf parenchyma the virus moves approximately 1 mm or 8-10 cells/day. \\nMost viruses require 2-5 days to move out of an inoculated leaf. In all economically \\nimportant viral infections virus reach the phloem and transport to long distance within \\nthe plant. Once the virus entered the phloem, it moves rapidly in it towards growing region \\nlike apical meristem and other food utilizing parts of the plant like tubers and rhizome. \\nThe development of local lesion symptoms is an indication of the localization of the \\nvirus within the lesion area. In systemic symptom the virus continued to spread beyond \\nthe borders of the lesion. \\nIn systemic virus infection some viruses are limited to phloem and a few adjacent \\nparenchyma cells. Many virus leave the growing point of stems or roots of affected plants \\napparently free of virus but few virus invade all new meristem tip tissues. \\nIt appears that the diseased condition induced in plants by viruses is the result of \\ninterference and disruption of normal metabolic processes in infected parenchyma or \\nspecialized cells. This interference is caused by the mere presence and multiplication of \\nvirus and possibly by the abnormal or toxic effects of additional virus-induced protein \\nor their products (not found yet). \\nPlant virus do not contain any enzymes, toxins or other pathogenic substances and \\nyet cause a variety of symptoms on host. Viral diseases of plant are not due primarily \\nto depletion of nutrients but due to more indirect effects of virus on the metabolism of \\nplant which is due to virus induced synthesis of new proteins by the host (like enzyme) \\nand may interfere with the normal metabolism of the host. \\nViral infection generally cause a decrease in photosynthesis through decrease in \\nchlorophyll/leaf, chlorophyll efficiency and leaf area per plant. Virus generally cause a \\ndecrease in the amount of growth regulating substances in the plant frequently by \\nincreasing a growth inhibiting substances. There is a decrease in soluble nitrogen during \\nrapid virus synthesis. A chronic decrease in the levels of carbohydrate is seen in the mosaic \\ndisease. \\nThe respiration of plants is generally increased immediately after infection but after \\nthe initial increase the respiration of infected plants became lower than that of healthy \\nplant. \\nSYMPTOMS \\nThe symptoms of plant virus diseases are of major importance in the identification \\nof the virus concerned. Most virus are named on the basis of chief symptom they produce \\non the host on which they were first reported. Symptomatology was very important in \\nthe early days of virus research before any of the viruses were isolated and characterized.'),\n",

They are also \\ninfluenced by the type and strain of virus, type and variety of host plant, age and stage \\nof development of virus and pathogens. Virus like symptoms may be caused by other plant \\npathogens like viroids, phytoplasma and fastidious bacteria. \\nThe term symptoms refers to visible abnormalities in plants. These symptoms are \\nin the form of colour changes of foliage or growth abnormalities. Mostly the hosts are \\naffected systematically by the viruses and the virus persist in infected· plants throughout \\nlife. Thus in vegetatively propagated plants the virus persist throughout life and the \\nprogenies are always virus infected. \\nWhen the infection remains confined near the site of virus entry, it is called local \\ninfection, but when infection spreads slowly to surrounding cells through plasmodesmata \\nand phloem to long distance in host system is called systemic infection. The time period \\nbetween the virus entry and first appearance of symptoms is called the incubation period. \\nThe abnormality develop in all parts of infected plants, not only externally but \\ninternally as well. \\nExternal Symptoms \\nThe external symptoms produced by virus infection is divided into two broad \\ncategories, those resulting due to infection of single inoculated cells of host plant and. \\nthose which cause systemic infection where the virus moves from the site of initial infection \\nto the entire plant. \\n(a) Colour changes: The word variegation refers to all types of colour changes on \\nleaves. The mosaic symptom are characterized by mottled green (spot or blotches of colour) \\nor patterns of green and yellow areas. When yellow colour is uniform and unbroken it \\nis known as chlorosis. In graminaceous plants, the mosaic pattern may be in the form \\nof streaks and stripes. Scorching of entire leaf or its margins is burnt appearance. In vein \\nclearing the tissues close to the veins turn yellow and the remaining lamina surface stays \\ngreen. In vein banding the tissue near the veins remain green and rest of the lamina surface \\nturns yellow. Colour changes are accompanied by some structural changes of the organ. \\nPouch like development of green parts of leaves are called puckering. The drying of cell \\nin a particular fashion leads to rings pots, black spots etc. The ring spot lesion consist \\nof a central group of dead cells beyond this there develop one or more superficial concentric \\nrings of dead cells with normal green tissue between them. Viruses producing ring spot \\ntype of symptoms are mostly transmitted by soil-living organism. Ring spot patterns may \\nalso occur on other organs for example bulbs and tubers. \\n(b) Changes in growth pattern: Leaf curl is a symptom in which leaves curl from \\nthe margins backward bringing the centre of the lamina upward. In leaf roll the margins \\nroll inward froming a trough like shape with midrib in the centre of the trough. The leaves \\nbecome thick and leathery due to accumulation of starch. Galls can be formed on leaves \\nand other organs. In mosaic diseases leaves may be abnormally lobed with fern like \\nappearance forming filiform or shoe-string structures. \\nVirus infected plants may show a wide range of developmental or growth abnor-'),\n",

Reduction in size of leaves and shoots is a common symptom in many virus \\ndiseases. When leaves are small they give a bushy appearance to the plant. Hypertrophy \\nand hyperplasia results in bunchy top or witches broom symptom. Stem sometimes show \\na spike like growth. Spindle tuber and spindle shoots are other growth abnormalities. \\nSome virus infections produces out growth or enations from the upper or lower \\nsurface of the leaves. These outgrowth are generally associated with vein of upper and \\nlower surface. These enations may be due to abnormal cell proliferation, as a result of \\nvirus induced changes in hormone concentration. Wound tumor virus produces wart like \\nout growths on the stems and roots of infected clover plants. \\n(c) Symptom on stems and roots: The major stem symptoms due to viral infection \\nare seen in swollen stems in cacao infected with cocoa swollen shoot disease. Tumors \\nare produced on the stem of clover plants by wound tumor virus. In woody plants stem \\nsymptom appears as flaking, cracking, necrosis of bark and excessive gum formation, stem \\nsplitting and scar formation. The prominent symptom seen on roots are abnormal \\nproliferation of rootlets, reduced number of adventitious roots. In legumes the N2 fixation \\nis reduced by virus infection. \\n(d) Flower Symptoms: In flowers the virus infection produces marked changes in \\ncolour. Colour breaking symptoms are very common in the flowers of many virus-infected \\nplants. The breaking usually consists of flecks, streaks or sectors of tissue. The breaking \\nof petal colour is due to loss of anthocyanin pigments. In a few instances there may be \\nincreased pigmentation in some areas of the petals. Infected flower are frequently smaller \\nand may drop prematurely. Flowers may be reduced in size, deformed in shape and quiet \\nfrequently flowering may be reduced. This effect the yield of viable seeds. \\n(e) Abnormalities in fruits, seeds and pollen: The viral infection show colour \\nchanges in the fruits. Fruits show mottling, ring, spotting and necrotic symptoms. Fruits \\nmay be distorted and misshappened. The texture of fruits can be changed like in cucumber \\nthe wart like projections develop due to cucumber mosaic virus infection. In tomato the \\nfruits may be dwarfed, malformed and seedless due to tomato aspermy virus. Virus \\ninfection may have drastic effects on seed production like in wheat, soybean. Sometimes \\nthe seed produced are completely abortive. The pollen production and pollens from \\ninfected plants are frequently sterile or viability is reduced. \\nIn musa cultivars infected with Banana virus the fruit bunch emerges from the side \\nof pseudo-stem inspite from the top of it. \\nInternal Symptoms \\nThe external symptom induced by viruses are frequently reflected in anatomical and \\nhistological changes within the plant. Mesophyll cells are smaller and less differentiated \\nwith few or no intercellular spaces. The vascular bundle may enlarge. The chloroplast \\nis reduced and as a result the tissue may become abnormally transleucent. Large number \\nof sieve elements in companion cells develop. Necrosis resisting from phloem may spread \\nto other tissues also. The internal changes in virus affected plants can be observed by \\nlight and electron microscopy and include anatomical and histological deviation, cyto\\xad\\nlogical and ultra structural changes and formation of inclusion bodies.'),\n",

There are mostly reports of increase in respiration rate in mosaic diseased plants. \\nBut in some cases where disease is well developed respiration rate may be lower. In plants \\ndeveloping local lesions the respiration rate is always higher. Increased respiration may \\ninvolve increase in the activity of some enzymes of glycolytic and pentose phosphate \\npathways. The results have been contradictory because various variable factors have not \\nbeen taken into account. \\nPhotosynthesis \\nVirus infection usually affects the process of photosynthesis. There is reduced carbon \\nfixation due to virus infection which may be due to a variety of biochemical and physical \\nchanges and becomes detectable a few days after infection. \\nChloroplast colour may change from normal green to colourless. There is a reduction \\nin the number of grana and chlorophyll content. Photosynthetic activity can be changed \\nor reduced due to change in chloroplast structure by reduced content of photosynthetic \\npigments or by reduction in specific proteins. \\nThe biochemistry of photosynthesis and related pathways can be affected as a result \\nof virus infection. There may be diversion of the products of photosynthesis carbon \\nfixation. Instead of sugar formation there may be production of organic acid and amino \\nacid. These changes, may be transitional and may return to normal pattern when active \\nvirus multiplication is over. \\nThe most general effect of virus infection is a reduction in photosynthetic activity \\nwhich is due to change in a variety of biochemical and phYSiological changes. \\nTranspiration \\nIn severly infected plants, transpiration rate is generally reduced as compared to \\nhealthy plants. The reported effects over the first 1-2 weeks after inoculation vary. \\nEnzymes \\nInfection may affect enzyme activities through changes in the amount of enzyme \\ninhibitors or activators released when cells are disrupted. Increase in catalase, peroxidase \\n(enzyme or isoenzymes) and polyphenol oxidases has been reported for various host-virus \\ncombinations. There is a marked increase in the activity of nucleases enzyme which may \\nbe because of there direct involvement with virus synthesis. Increase in activity was also \\nobserved in acid phosphatase, aconitase and starch synthetase in different host-virus \\ncombination. However pentose phosphate isomerease and succinyl co-A synthetase \\nactivity was decreased following infection with TMV in tobacco plants.

Systemic virus infections tend to impair the steady state auxin levels \\nwith consequent morphological alterations. Stunting in virus infected plants has been \\nassociated with a decrease in gibbrellins. Change have been observed in reduced or \\nincreased cytokinins and absicic acids. \\nThe most affected plant growth regulator is ethylene which is associated with \\nsenescence in plants. Generally its production is increased in virus' infection. \\nCHANGES IN LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT METABOLITES \\nThere are reports of accumulation of free amino acids in virus infected plants. An \\nincrease in amides (glutamine and asparagines) may be due two reasons: either due to \\nthe breakdown of host proteins or due to inhibition of normal protein synthesis as a result \\nof which they are not properly utilized and accumulate in free from. However in many \\nhost virus combinations deficiency of both soluble and insoluble nitrogen compounds may \\noccur during periods when virus is rapidly being synthesized. \\nPhosphorus is a vital component of all viruses and disturbances in phosphorus \\ncontent is observed in virus infected plants. However there is no clear picture of the effect \\nof virus infection on host phosphorus metabolism. Increase in organic acid synthesis \\nduring virus replication is reported. Some essential elements like Mn, Cu, Zn are highly \\nreduced in virus infection whereas the infection has slight effect on K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Band \\nAI. Reduction in specific mineral elements are associated with certain virus disease \\nsymptoms. \\nVirus infection causes loss of chlorophylls giving the yellowish colouration due to \\ncarotene and xanthophylls but these pigments are also decreased in' some diseases. In \\nsome virus infections particularly characterized by dark green symptoms, there may be \\nmore chlorophyll than the uninoculated control plants. \\nChanges in nucleic acid: Virus infection has little effect on DNA content of host cell. \\nHowever this infection affect differently with RNA synthesis in different host virus \\ncombinations. Chloroplast and cytoplasmic rRNA synthesis may be affected as a result \\nof virus infection. This effect of infection may vary with age. The changes observed in \\nyoung and old leaves significantly vary. A reduction in chloroplast ribosomes without \\na marked effect on cytoplasmic ribosomes is a fairly common feature for mosaic diseases. \\nChanges in Proteins: There is a substantial reduction in host protein synthesis (by \\n75%), when the virus is actively replicating in virus infection. During this period the host \\nmachinery is involved in the synthesis of viral proteins rather than host proteins. The \\ncoat protein of a virus (like TMV) can represent half of the total protein in the diseased \\nleaf. A reduction in the amount of most abundant host protein ribulose biphosphate \\ncarboxyl oxygenase (RUBISCO) is one of the commonest effects of virus that cause mosaic \\nand yellowing diseases. \\nLipids: The lipid content of leaves infected with virus may be greater than healthy \\nleaves or in few host-virus combinations it may be less. \\nCarbohydrates: Virus infection significantly influences the carbohydrate synthesis\"),\n",

Sastry and Singh (1971, 1974a), Sastry \\net al. (1976) and Singh et al., (1973) have made detailed study of reiationship between \\nvector, vector control, and incidence of tomato leaf curl. Viral diseases causes severe losses \\non all fresh market and canning tomatoes. \\nLEAF CURL OF TOMATO \\nThe disease has been reported from India, Sri Lanka, Nyasaland (Malawi) and South \\nAfrica. Leaf curl disease incidence is reported to be 83% in the winter crop planted in \\nOctober and 14% in the summer crop planted in February (Tripathi and Varma, 2002). \\nWhen the plants are infected within 20 days of transplanting the loss may be up to 92% \\nwhile infections of 35 and 50 days old crops result in 74 and 29% loss, respectively. \\nSymptoms \\nLeaf curl is characterized by severe stunting of the plants due to shortening of \\ninternodes and downward rolling and crinkling of the leaves. The newly formed leaves \\nshow chlorosis. The older curled leaves become leathery and brittle. After the plant \\nbecomes infected there is considerable drop of flowers, fruit fails to set, and no more \\nmarketable fruit is produced. The whole plant looks pale and produces more lateral \\nbranches resulting in a bushy appearance. There is partial or complete sterility of the plant. \\nThe Causal Organism \\nLeaf curl of tomato is caused by the Tobacco leaf curl virus (geminivirus group or \\nfamily Geminiviridae, genus Begomovirus). Its synonyms are Tobacco cabbaging virus, \\ntobacco curly leaf virus and tobacco frenching virus. The genome of geminiviruses is \\ncomposed of circular, single stranded DNA, encapsulated by multiple subunits of a single \\ncapsid protein. Most are bipartite having two almost equal sized genomic components \\ndesignated A and B, separately encapsulated in geminate particles (Poiston et al. 1997). \\nThe Indian isolates from New Delhi and Karnataka have been separately named such \\nas Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNdV), a bipartite strain, and Tomato leaf curl \\nBangalore virus (ToLCBV), a monopartile strain. Chakraborty et al (2003) have described \\ntomato leaf curl Gujarat virus (ToLCGV) from Varanasi in India which causes a severe \\nleaf curl disease of tomato.\"),\n",

The \\nToLCV is neither seed nor sap transmissible but external contamination of seed m2ty occur. \\nDodder transmission has been reported in India. The main agency of its transmission \\nin nature is the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci. TYLCV is a whitefly transmitted geminivirus \\ngenome consists of a single circular SSDNA the genome of the other known whitefly \\ntransmitted goes viruses consists of two ssDNA. The vector can transmit the virus after \\na 20-minute acquisition access period and 60 min of inoculation access period with \\nminimum latency period of 4-9 hours. In India, the virus is reported to be transmitted \\nby the vector after 30 minutes of acquisition access and 30 min of inoculation access \\nperiods with a latency period of 6 hours. Even a single viruliferous whitefly is able to \\ntransmit the virus. The virus is retained by the vector for more than 12 days or for the \\nwhole life but there is no evidence that it multiplies in the vector or is transferred to the \\nprogeny of the vector. The time required for symptom expression varies in different \\ncultivars of tomato. Whitefly populations per plant also vary with host cultivar. The \\nnumber of whiteflies per plant has no relationship with the time of appearance or severity \\nof symptoms. At low temperatures symptoms are delayed. \\nControl and Treatment \\nResistance to the virus in commonly cultivated tomato varieties is lacking. Wild \\ntomato (Lycopersicon pemvianum) has high degree of resistance to the leaf curl virus. L. \\nglalldulosll1n also does not show symptoms of leaf curl. Some accessions of the wild species \\nLycopersicon hirslltll11l have been identified as the best source of resistance to tomato leaf \\ncurl virus as well as tomato yellow leaf curl virus. In Punjab, the genotypes TLB 111, \\n119, 122, 128, 129, 130 and 134 have been found resistant to ToLCV. \\nProtection of seedlings from infection brought by the vectors is important. It can be \\nachieved by using insecticides or insect repellents. Tripathi and Verma (2002) have \\ndemonstrated that seedlings protected by perforated polythene bags and transplanted in \\npolysheet mulched fields have low incidence of the disease. Some workers have claimed \\ngood control of the disease through reducing vector population. Use of systemic insec\\xad\\nticides such as methyl parathion (0.02%) and dimethoate (0.5%) as spray of carbofuran \\n(1.5 kg a.i.jha) as soil application has been found effective in controlling build up of \\nwhitefly population and thus reducing the incidence of leaf curl. Spraying should be \\nstarted soon after transplanting. Carbofuran (Furadon 3G) at the rate of 3.3gj Sq.lll. not \\nonly reduces disease incidence but also increases fruit yield. Nursery treatment, seedling \\nsoak, and plot treatments reduce populations of Bemisia tabaci and diseases incidence. \\nSastry et al (1976) suggested increased plant population from 30 to 90 per sq.m., three \\napplications of insecticides (parathion 0.02%, demetonmethyl 0.02% or dimethoate 0.05%) \\nas spray at 15-days interval with one soil application of phorate or carbofuran for control \\nof the disease. Foliar application of the antibiotics Validomycin-A (0.02%), Avomycin-A \\n(0.01 %) and of guanidine azoguanine, etc. suppress the disease. Mukherjee and \\nRaychaudhuri (1966) had reported that the root dip of tomato seedlings in gibberellic acid \\nand 2-thiouracil at 50 pp, reduces leaf curl incidence. Spraying of 2,4-D is highly effective'),\n",

Considerable efforts are presently \\nbeing made to genetically engineer tomato plants to express certain genomic areas of \\nTyLCV that seem to protect the plant from subsequent infection by the virus. \\nMOSAIC OF TOMATO \\nTomato mosaic can be caused by many different viruses such as TMV, Cucumber \\nmosaic virus (CMV), Potato virus X, and Potato virus Y. The common tomato mosaic was \\nearlier thought to be the same as TMV but now it is considered to be a distinct virus \\n(ToMV) of the same tobamovirus group. \\nSymptoms \\nThe symptoms of tomato mosaic are generally influenced by temperature, day length, \\nlight intensity, plant age, virus strain, and tomato variety. In the tropics or in warm weather \\nwith long day length and high light intensity leaves show light and dark green mosaic \\nmottle, sometimes with distortion of young leaves. Green areas are sunken giving the leaf \\na rough appearance. In winter, with low light intensity, short day length, and temperature \\nnot above 20°C, plants often are severely stunted and leaves distorted to \"fern-Ieaf\" or \\ntendril-shape but mottling may be slight. Seedling infection may kill the plants. Fruits \\nare fewer, undersized, and often deformed. In some cases there is necrosis of stem, petioles, \\nleaves and fruits. \\nIn aucuba mosaic the symptoms appear as downward curling of the whole leaf \\nwith slight turning down at the margins. Surface of the leaf is rough, wrinkled or \\ncorrugated. Chlorosis appears as small points of yellow areas and gradually spreads. \\nIn extreme cases almost the entire lamina of old and new leaves becomes pale yellow \\nto white, with scattered small islands of green which stand up as blisters. In less extreme \\ncases the green areas are larger but not as large as the chlorotic areas. The plant is \\nnot killed but growth is retarded. The virus induces pollen sterility which results in \\nlow fruiting and low yield. \\nThe Causal Organism \\nThe virus causing the common mosaic of tomato is known as TOlllato mosaic virus \\n(ToMV, tobamovirus group). There are many strains of the virus producing different \\nsymptoms and often these have been described as different diseases. These strains are \\ntomato aucuba mosaic, tomato enation mosaic, yellow rings spot strain and tomato rosetted \\nstrain. \\nParticles of the virus are straight tubules with helical construction and measure 300 \\nx 18 nm. The single stranded RNA constitutes about 5% of the particle weight. The \\nparticles occur in all the tissues including the pollen and seed but not in the embryo. \\nThe inclusion bodies appear as crystalline structures, amorphous masses, fine needles, \\nfibrous spikes, spindle bodies, and amoeboid X-bodies.'),\n",

In air-dried tomato leaves the virus has been found to remain infective even \\nafter 24 years at laboratory temperatures. The sap retains infectivity for 77 days or more \\nat laboratory temperatures and for several years at 0° to 2°C. The virus, like the TMV, \\nis easily sap transmissible and is mainly transmitted by man through contact during \\ncultivation. No natural vector are known. Seed transmission also occurs mainly as external \\nseed contamination. TMV and ToMV become established in the seeds of tomato and bell \\npepper, irrespective of plant growth stage, at the time of inoculation. However, concen\\xad\\ntration of the virus is high in seeds from plants inoculated early. Dodder can transmit \\nthe virus. Diseased crop debris is also a source of primary inoculum. \\nControl \\nUse of virus-free seedlings is the most important step for control of tomato mosaic. \\nTo produce healthy seedlings the seedbeds should be those in which no solanaceous crop \\nsusceptible to TMV had been grown for the last 4-6 months. Soil sterilization by heat is \\nalso recommended. Seeds should be treated in hot water at 50°C for 25 min or with 20% \\ntrisodium phosphate solution. There should be an interval of at least 5 months between \\nsusceptible crops in the same filed. Field workers should avoid use of tobacco products \\nwhile working in the field. If they remove a diseased plant they should wash their hands \\nin soap solution. \\nRICE TUNGRO VIRUSES \\nTungro is the most important virus disease of rice in south and south-east Asia and \\nalso in the southern part of China. The virus is reported from Philippines, Malaysia, \\nIndonesia, Thailand, India and Pakistan. In India the disease is present in the south east \\nto the north west parts of the country. The annual loss due to tungro is estimated at US \\n$ 1.5 billion globally. \\nSymptoms \\nIn rice the symptoms depend on host cultivar. In the cultivar TN 1, seedlings show \\nstunting with mottling and yellowing of leaves. In growing plants there is reduced \\ntillering. Yellowing and orange yellow coloration of leaves is a common symptom. Small \\nand sterile panicles develop in mature plants. In early infection the young plants may \\ndie prematurely. \\nThe Causal Organism \\nTungro is a composite disease caused by two viruses: the rice tungro spherical virus \\n(RTSV) and the rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV). The RSTV is a ssRNA virus which \\ncauses only very mild stunting of the host plants without leaf symptoms but it intensifies \\nthe symptoms of tungro caused by RTBV. The RTBV is a dsDNA bacilliform virus which \\ncauses mild stunting and yellowing of leaves. RTBV causes the main symptoms of tungro. \\nIt is dependent on RSTV for transmission by the insect vectors. In Philippines and South'),\n",

However, all except \\nOnJza species are poor hosts of the vectors. \\nThe rice tungro viruses are not transmitted by sap inoculation or ,by seed or dodder. \\nIn nature the main agency of tungro transmission is the green leafhopper, Nephotettix \\ncincticeps (N. virescens). Other vectors are N. nigropictus, N. malayanus, N. parvus, N. apicalis \\nand Recilia (Anazuma) dorsalis. N. cincticeps is the most effective vector and disperses the \\nvirus in the rice fields.

The vector becomes viruliferous \\nimmediately after feeding. Nymphs cease to transmit the virus when they molt. All stages \\nlose ability to transmit the virus within 5 days after the end of the acquisition feed. Weed \\nhosts that may playa role in survival and dissemination of the rice tungro viruses include \\nLeersia hexandra, Eleusine indica, Echinochloa crusgalli, Echinochloa glabrescens, E. colona and \\nLeptochloa chinensis. \\nN. cinticeps is monophagous to rice. Its density can reach high levels depending on \\nthe environment. After rice is harvested, the density of this vector falls rapidly to a low \\nlevel or to nil in the rice fields. Seasonal pattern of immigration and population dynamics \\nof the major vectors (N. cincticeps, N. nigropictus and Recilia dorsalis) determines the \\nincidence of tungro. Under Assam conditions, Nath and Bhagabati (2002) observed that \\nleafhopper populations are first seen during June-July in the seedbeds. The population \\nreaches the peak in the main field in October-November and then disappears from \\nDecember to May. N. virescens populations were lower than N. nigropictus but higher than \\nR. dorsalis. Tungro infected plants including rice stubbles or volunteer rice serve as source \\nof RTBV and RTSV. The vector that feeds on source plants, moves to newly transplanted \\nfields in surrounding areas and disperses the viruses. Probably the flight range of N. \\ncincticeps is several kilometers. Initially few plants are infected and form the source for \\nfurther spread. Generally, the plants with secondary infection from such sources form'),\n",

Such patches later fuse with each other. In \\ntungro-endemic areas major infection of rice plants with the viruses occurs after trans\\xad\\nplanting. Infection rate in the seedbeds is low. In transplanted fields, infection with RTSV \\nalone precedes infection with RTBV. The disease incidence is generally low in fields \\nplanted in the early crop season when the vector population is low, but it is high in fields \\nplanted later when the vector population has built up. \\nControl \\nUse of rice cultivars resistant to tungro has been a major approach for control of. \\nthe disease. The resistance to the viruses is correlated with resistance to the vectors. The \\nresistant cultivars become susceptible in few years because populations of the vector \\ndevelops that can feed on these cultivars. A transgenic japonica rice plant is reported that \\ncontains RTSV replicase gene.

The occurrence of sugarcane mosaic in India was first discovered in 1921 \\nat Pusa (Bihar). Although a source of potential danger to sugar industry in countries like \\nthe USA, the disease has not been regarded as menace to sugarcane in this country. Even \\na 100% mosaic affected crop shows a reduction of about 10-12% in yield and the juice \\nquality remains unaffected. Perhaps, it is due to prevalence of some mild strain(s) of the \\nvirus occurring in most of the sugarcane varieties in India. There are indications that more \\nvirulent strains are also present in the country on certain varieties like Co. 313 in Punjab \\nand Co. 527. The disease may cause as much as 21 % loss in yield. \\nSymptoms \\nThe first symptom of sugarcane mosaic appear about 6 weeks after planting and \\ncontinue to develop throughout the monsoon season after which they are obliterated on \\nmaturity of the plants. The primary and critical symptom of the disease is the appearance \\nof pale patches or blotches in the green surface of the leaf. Small areas of the leaf are \\nof a paler green colour than the rest. These patches are not uniform in size and shape.'),\n",

In other parts of the world, the patches on \\nsugarcane leaf are not confined between veins but in India there is a clear demarcation \\nof these patches by the leaf veins. The youngest unfolded leaves show the mottling very \\nclearly while the symptoms are not very clear on older leaves. Sometimes leaves of young \\ntillers are stiff, erect and crinkled. Mottling of the stem also occurs in some varieties and \\nmay lead to death of cells resulting in formation of cankers. \\nThe cells of affected leaves always show, in one part of the cytoplasm, an area of \\nproteolysis.

Stems may show \\nmottling or marbling , the areas later becoming necrotic. The stems becomes small and \\ndeformed. \\nThe Causal Organism \\nSugarcane mosaic virus (750 x llnm) is transmitted primarily vegetatively in \\nsugarcane during propogation of the crop. The disease is caused by sugarcane mosaic \\nvirus (SCMV) which belongs to potyviruses group. Its synonym is grass mosaic virus. \\nThe particles of the virus are flexuous filaments measuring 620-750 x 13-15 nm. Maximum \\nconcentration of virus particles is found in young leaves and minimum in roots of old \\ninfected plants. Particle composition is not fully known. In addition to sugarcane, the virus \\ncan infect other graminaceous plants such as maize, sorghum, millets, wheat, barley, \\nrye, and some grasses. Natural occurrence of the virus on maize, sorghum, pearl millet \\nand elephant grass has been reported from India. Brachiaria is also a natural host of \\nsome strains of SMV. One strain that attacks Mllsa textilis has some hosts outside the \\ngramineae. \\nThe following serologically related potyviruses were considered strain of the Sug\\xad\\narcane mosaic vims. Sugarcane mosaic strains A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K (these strains \\nrarely infect sorghum), Maize dwarf mosaic strain A and B, Sorghum red stripe strain, \\nEuropean maize mosaic strain and Abaca mosaic strain on Musa textilis. \\nDisease Cycle \\nThe virus is transmitted from sugarcane to sugarcane by at least 7 species of aphids \\nsuch as Dacttj1lOtus ambrosiae, Hysterolleura setariae, Rhopalosiphll1n maidis, Toxoptera graminum, \\nR. maidis and Shizaphis graminum are reported as vectors of sugarcane mosaic virus in \\nIndia. Transmission is in the non-persistent manner. Seed transmission is reported only \\nfor maize dwarf mosaic strain. Vegetative propagation is the main source of primary \\ninfection in sugarcane. \\nThe thermal inactivation point of SCMV is 53-55°C and dilution end point 1:1000. \\nIn vitro longevity is 2-24 hours. \\nFor experimental purposes the virus can easily be transmitted by introducing it into \\nthe actively growing tissues. Young leaves are most suitable for testing. Most common \\nmethod is to use a needle to puncture the tissue over which infected juice has been spread \\nor infected leaf has been wrapped.

The first actual demonstration of an algal virus was made by Safferman & \\nMorris (1963) from the waste stabilization pond of Indiana University (USA). They isolated \\nthe virus from the filamentous blue-green alge Plectonema bonJanum. Safferman and morris \\ntested 78 algal species For susceptibility to the virus and of these the virus lysed 11 \\nfilamentous strains. Among the genera infected were LyngbtJa, Plectonema and Phormidium. \\nThe first algal virus was named as strain LPP-I, the initials representing these three hosts. \\nThere after several serological strains of LPP were isolated and named LPP-I LPP-2, \\nLPP-3, LPP-4 and LPP-5. These viruses are called as blue green algal viruses or \\ncyanophages. They screened 78 host organisms and found the cyanophages only in 11 \\nfilamentous cyanobacteria. \\nAfter the initial discovery several workers including Singh et al from Banaras Hindu \\nUniversity, India and Padan et al (1967) from Israel, Daft et al (1970) from Scotland \\nreviewed different type of cyanophages. \\nProperties of Cyanophages \\n(1) The morphology of LPP-I is studied in more detail as compared to other \\ncyanophages. They differ, morphologically as well as in their physio chemical properties. \\n(2) They are an icosahedron with a hexagonal head capsid and the tail is short with \\na length of approximately one quarter the diameter of the capsid (similar to T3 and T7 \\nbacteriophages) where as N-I group resembles with T2 and T4 phages (like T even, the \\ntail may be contractile or non-contractile). According to Smith et al. (1966b) the tail \\nassembly is longer in virus particles attached to the photosynthetic membranes.'),\n",

The group G m and D-I are \\nserologically related but not show any relationship with T -phages. \\nLife Cycle \\nSimilar like bacteriophages the cyanophages follow the same one-step growth curve. \\nThe growth cycle resembles with that of T 4 phages. \\nThe first sign of infection in the alga can be readily recognized under optical \\nmicroscope by displacement of photosynthetic membranes. The actual infection of the alga \\ncan be observed on the electron microscope. Large number of virus particles can be seen \\nwith their tails inserted in the alga. \\nThe growth cycle of LPP-I has been studied in greater detail. LPP- I is adsorbed on \\nhost surface and the DNA is injected into the host cell leaving the protein coat outside \\nthe cell wall. The mechanism of DNA injection is not known. However soon after injection \\nof the genome the rate of protein synthesis is reduced and gradually blocked at the end \\nof 5 hour of injection. The phage multiplies in the invaginated photosynthetic lamellae \\nor in virogenic stroma. After injection following three types of proteins are formed earliest \\nproteins, earlier protein and the late or structural proteins. After three hours of infection, \\ndegradation of the host DNA begins and by the end of ~ hr it is converted into acid \\nsoluble matfrial. Sufficient amount of degraded DNA material is used up in building of \\nviral DNA. It is seen that in virogenic stroma synthesis of viral DNA takes place. The \\nlatent period differs in different viruses for example 7 hrs in LPP-I and N -I. At the end \\nafter maturation and assembly the progeny cyanophages are released almost from each \\ncell leaving aside the lysed cell. \\nAll nucleic acids of cyanophages analysed so far are linear double stranded DNAs. \\nThe cyanophages can playa significant role in control of blooms.

It aggregate to form crystalline granules. \\nLee (1971) described a virus from a algae (Sirodotia) it occurs in crystalline arrays of \\npolygonal particles each about 500-600A ° in diameter. \\nA virus has been isolated from a green alga, Oedogonium which occur in the germling \\nstages of the alga and is hexagonal in transverse section with a maximum dimension \\nof about 2400A o.'),\n",

It is the most resistant virus known so far of which the thermal death \\npoint is 90°C for 10 minutes. TMV was the first virus that was crystallized by Stanley \\nin 1935 from USA. \\nPathogen causes the damage on leaves, flowers, fruits and causes stunting in plants. \\nThe general symptom are chlorosis, curling, mottling, dwarfing, distortion and blistering \\nof leaves. TMV damages the solonaceous plant. After infection the common symptom is \\nappearance of irregular dark green and light green areas on the leaves (patchy pattern \\nof discoloured areas). The dark green areas are thicker and appears elevated, blister like \\nover the thinner, chlorotic light green areas. Slight downward curling and distortion of \\nleaves can also be seen. The leaves become narrow and elongated rather than oval shaped. \\nMottling of older leaves with or without malformations of the leaflets is produced \\nwhen the disease affects tomato. Leaflets become long and pointed and sometimes \\nshoestring like. The virus reduces the yield as well as quality of products i.e. nicotine \\ncontent is decreased by 20-30%. \\nFranklin et al.

The virion consist of protein \\ncoat, made up of 2,130 protein subunit of identical size. The protein subunits are arranged \\naround a central hole of 4 nm (40AO). Each protein subunit is made up of single \\npolypeptide chain made by 158 amino acids, the molecule weight of each polypeptide \\nchain is 17,500 dalton. The central/hole consist of ssRNA molecule which is also spirally \\ncoiled to form helix. This RNA consist of 6,500 nucleotides.

Viral disease like small pox \\nwas linked to super natural causes and people used to perform offerings to goddess, 'Shitala' \\nthroughout the country assuming that shitala had incarnated in the sufferers. Animal \\nviruses have the same type of components as plant and bacterial viruses. They have the \\nvirion or the virus particle made up of the viral capsid which is made up of protein \\ncontaining inside nucleic acid either DNA or RNA. The virus architecture is of two types \\nhelical (rod shaped, cylindrical) or icosahedral (spherical, quasispherical). For example the \\nadenovirus is icosahedral, where as rabies virus is bullet shaped. Unlike plant and bacterial \\nviruses the animal pathogenic virus contain an extra envelop outside the protein coat. This \\nenvelope is generally derived from the host cell membrane, but modified by insertion of \\nvirallyencoded glycoproteins and removal of host membrane protein during virus maturation. \\nThese enveloped viruses are sensitive to drying and treatment with acid and detergent.

Adsorption! Attachment \\nThe virus particles get absorbed to the plasma membrane of the host cells by binding \\nto specific sites where the receptor proteins (usually glycoproteinsl are situated. The \\npresence of these receptor proteins is crucial in the viral infection and it may determine \\nhost resistance or susceptibility. The receptor proteins are usually surface proteins \\nnecessary for the host cell, as these proteins are also receptors for hormones and other \\nimportant molecules which get into the cell and are essential to the cell's function. The \\nvirus mimics these essential molecules and manages to get into the cell by endocytosis. \\nMany host receptor proteins are related to immunolgobulins. For example HIV CD4 \\nreceptor, and the polio ICAM (intercellular adhesion molecule) receptor. In some cases \\ntwo or more cell receptors may be involved. The surface site on the viral particle will \\nbe an array of specific proteins. Envelope glycoproteins may also be involved in adsorption \\nin enveloped viruses. The herpes simplex virus has two glycoproteins that are involved \\nin adsorption. In adenoviruses, the projections extending from the corners of the capsid \\nplaya role in binding to host cell receptors. Spikes of some enveloped viruses also play \\nsimilar roles (myxovirus). For example, the influenza virus has two kinds of spikes, \\nhaemagglutinin, and neutraminidase. The haemogglutinin (H spike) attach to the host \\ncell receptor site and recognize siatic acid (N-acetyl neuraminic acid). The N spike \\n(Neuraminidase) helps the virus in penetrating the nasal and respiratory tract secretions \\nby degrading mucosal polysaccharides. However the receptor sites vary from person to \\nperson. \\n2. Penetration and Uncoating \\n(a) and (b) Direct penetration or fusion with plasma membrane \\nSome non-enveloped viruses such as the polio virus, undergo changes in capsid \\nstructure on adsorption to the plasma membrane, and release only their nucleic acids into \\nthe host cell. In the paramyxoviruses, and some other enveloped viruses, the capsids fuse \\nwith host cell plasma membrane. Fusion occurs between the envelope glycoprotins and \\nthe host plasma membrane proteins. Then the membrane lipids rearrange forming a \\nproteinaceous fusion pore. The nucelocapsid enters the host cell where uncoating take \\nplace. \\n(c) Endocytosis \\nEnveloped viruses may enter the host cell in another way.

In some viruses the coating is done by lysosomal enzymes \\nof the host cell which degrade protein coat and make the nucleic acid free in cytoplasm. \\nIn Pox virus the viral DNA synthesizes a specific protein after infection. Thus it varies \\nwith virus groups. \\n4. (i) Replication of DNA Viruses \\nThe genes which express early are the ones which are meant to execute host cell \\narrest. The virulent animal viruses arrest all the functions of the host cell such as DNA, \\nRNA and protein synthesis. The virus DNA replication usually takes place in the host \\nnucleus using host DNA polymerase-II, except in the poxviruses (such as vaccinia) whose \\ngenomes replicate in the cytoplasm. In most viruses, early transcription occurs using host \\nenzymes (polymerases) except in poxvirus where early mRNA is transcribed by a viral \\npolymerase. \\nThe genome of some viruses are too small to have enough genes for their replication \\n(e.g., Parvoviruses). The Parvovirus has the genome to code for three polypeptides which \\nare components of the capsid. The DNA of the virus is single stranded and linear. The \\nDNA being very small has to replicate in the host nucleus during the host DNA replication \\nusing the host DNA polymerases. This virus is usually associated with adenovirus and \\ncalled adeno-associated virus. Replication along with the adenovirus will help the virus \\nto replicate in a dependent way. \\nHepatitis-B virus (a number of Hepadnavirus group) is an enveloped virus with \\nan incomplete dsDNA genome. It has a genome replication strategy similar to that of the \\nretroviruses. Its genome is first completed and circularized in the cytoplasm, and \\ntransported to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the mRNAs are transcribed. Nucleocapsid is \\nassembled in the cytoplasm along with virally coded reverse transcriptase. The DNA is \\nsynthesized inside the virion by reverse transcribing RNA copies of the genome. \\nHerpesviruses are dsDNA viruses with icosahedral enveloped virions causing \\nimportant human and animal diseases. The genome-contains 50-100 genes. Upon \\nuncoating, the DNA is transcribed by the host RNA polymerase to form mRNAs to direct \\nthe synthesis of early proteins, the enzymes required for DNA replication, DNA replication \\ntakes place in the nucleus with the formation of virus-specific DNA polymerase. Host \\nDNA synthesis slows down. \\nPoxviruses (e.g., vaccinia) are the largest animal viruses known and are also most \\ncomplex. The double-stranded DNA contain'> around 200 genes. The virus enters through \\nendocytosis in coated vesicles. The central core of the virus contains DNA and DNA \\ndependent RNA polymerase that synthesizes the early mRNAs. DNA polymerases and \\nother enzymes needed for the DNA replication are also synthesized in the early part of \\nthe reproductive cycle, DNA replication begins about 1.5 hours after infection.

In faeces, at room temperature, the virus can remain infective for \\nseveral weeks. Being non enveloped they are insensitive to ether, chloroform and \\ndeoxycholate. The virus is readily killed by moist heat at 50-55°C, but in food stuffs the \\nvirus may survive exposure to 60°C and holder method of pasteurization. Enteroviruses \\nare rapidly inactivated by ultraviolet light, drying, formaldehyde (0.3%), hydrochloric acid \\n(0.1 M) or free residual chlorine (0.3-0.5 ppm). However, higher concentrations of chlorine \\nare necessary to inactivate virus in the presence of organic matter because the latter \\ndiminishes the activity of chlorine. \\nComposition: The RNA genome constitutes about one quarter of the virion. The RNA \\nis single stranded and of positive sense and can be translated directly by host ribosome. \\nThe capsid consist of a protein shell arranged in icosahedral symmetry around the RNA \\nmolecule. Four major peptides are reCOgnized in the shell VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4 and \\nare formed from a single precursor protein VP 0 by proteolytic cleavage.

The size chemical properties and physical \\nproperties and resistance of the three types are all identical and so their antigenic \\nproperties provide one of the main method to differentiation. These viruses have affinity \\nfor nervous tissue and narrow host range. Only man and some primates like cynomologous \\nand rhesus monkeys are susceptible. These monkeys can be infected by the oral route \\nand develop paralysis. \\nConsiderable interest was generated in poliomyelitis after 1916 when more than \\n27,000 persons were paralysed and 6,000 died in a major epidemic in the USA which \\nhad mainly hit the adult population. \\nNatural infection occurs only in man. The virus is spread from man to man by faecal\\xad\\noral route and because early multiplication occurs in both the or9phanynx and the \\nintestinal mucosa, therefore, the virus is also spread by pharyngeal secretions (droplet \\ninfection) during first week of illness. No intermediate host is known. \\nOn entering the body of a new host the virus multiplies in then tonsils and peyer's \\npatches of the ileum. Spread to regional lymph nodes (cervical and mesenteric) leads to \\na viraemia, enabling the virus to become disseminated throughout the body including cord \\nand brain. \\nPathogenesis \\n1. Neural spread may occur in children with inapparent infection at the time of \\ntonsillectomy. Poliovirus present in the orophanynx may enter nerve fibres \\nexposed during surgery and spread to brain resulting in bulbar paralysis. \\n2. A similar mechanism of viral spread via neural pathways may be responsible \\nfor paralysis of a limb recently injected with inflammatory injections such as \\ndiphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vaccine.

Rabies \\nvirus is excreted in the saliva of affected animals. Man acquires infection by the bite of \\nrabid dog or other animals. Rarely infection can occur following licks on abraded skin \\nand intact mucosa. Infection has occurred through the inhalation of massive virus aerosle \\ngenerated in bat caves and in laboratory accidents. \\nInfection by bite of rabid animal results in deposition of rabies infected saliva deep \\nin the striated muscles. The virus replicates in the muscle cell or cells of epithelial tissues. \\nAfter reaching a sufficient concentration it infects peripheral nerves in the muscle or skin. \\nOnce within the nerve fibres it is out of reach of any circulating anti body and travels \\nalong the axon towards the central nervous system at a speed of 3 mm per hour. In the \\ncentral nervous system it multiplies and produces encephalitis. The virus then spreads \\noutwards along the nerve trunks to various parts of the body including the salivary glands. \\nIt multiplies in the salivary glands and is shed in the saliva. There is little evidence that \\nhaematogenous or other modes of spread are involved. \\nThe presence of virus in the saliva and the irritability and aggression brought on \\nby the enc~phalitis ensure the transmission and survival of the virus in nature. The virus \\nultimately reaches virtually every tissue in the body and is almost invariably present in \\nthe cornea and the skin of face and nape of the neck of the patient because of their \\nproximity to the brain. This provides a method for the antemortem diagnosis of rabies. \\nThe virus may also be shed in the milk and wine.ln humans the incubation period is \\n1-3 months or may be as short as 7 days or as long as three years. \\nExposure of humans to rabies virus does not necessarily result in .infection. Contrary \\nto popular belief, man is not highly susceptible to the virus. The incidence of human rabies \\nafter bites by known rabid dogs is about 15%. However, the incidence ranges from \\n1 % after contamination of minor wounds to more than 60% after severe bites on the \\nface. \\nIn dogs the incubation period is usually 3-6 weeks but it may range from 10 days \\nto a year. The initial signs are an alert, troubled air and a change in disposition with \\nrestlessness Snapping at imaginary object licking or gnawing at the site of the bite. After \\n2-3 days of this prodromal stage the disease, develops into either the furious or dumb \\ntype of rabies. In furious rabies (more common) the dogs runs amok, biting without \\nprovocation & indiscriminately. The lower jaws droops and saliva drools from the mouth. \\nParalysis, convulsions and death follow. In dumb rabies the animal lies huddled, unable \\nto feed. The dog may not bite but attempts to feed it are dangerous. About 60% of rabid \\ndogs shed the virus in saliva. Rabid dogs usually die in 3-5 days. \\nThe characteristic histopathological feature in rabies is the intracytoplasmic inclusion \\nbody (Negri body) in the neurons, most abundant in cerebellum and hippocampus. \\nNegribodies are composed of a finely fibrillar matrix and rabies virus particles. \\nPhysical and chemical properties: The virus is sensitive to ethanol, iodine \\npreparations, quarternayr ammonium compounds, soap, detergents and lipid solvents like \\nether chloroform and acetone.

Two epidemiological types of rabies exist-urban, \\ntransmitted by domestic animals like dogs and cats, and sylva tic, involving animals in \\nthe wild, such as jackals, wolves, foxes, mongooses, skunks and bats. Most cases of human \\nrabies follow dog bites but in endemic areas almost any animal can transmit rabies. In \\nIndia, antirabic treatment is to be considered following the bite of any animal except rats. \\nWhere urban or domestic rabies has been controlled, as in the USA, the majority of \\ninfections are due to bites by wild animals. \\nThe primary source of the rabies virus in nature seems to be in the mustelids and \\nviverrids, the ermine in the northern coniferous forests, the skunk, mink and weasel in \\nNorth America, the mottled pole cat in the USSR, the civet and pole cat in Africa and \\nthe mongoose in Asia. Rabies virus has been isolated repeatedly from the brain and \\nsalivary glands of apparently healthy wild rodents. The virus survives in this reservoir \\npopulation by achieving a state of latency with occasional activation such that only a \\nsmall proportion of them will be shedding the virus at anyone time. 'From the reservoir \\nspecies, wild vectors such as foxes, wolves and jackals acquire the infection and \\noccasionally epizootics occur in these species. Carnivorous animals may acquire the \\ninfection by eating carcasses containing the virus. From these species the disease spreads \\nto dogs and other domestic animals. \\nAnother natural cycle of rabies concerns bats. A fatal paralytic disease of cattle & \\nhumans was noticed in Central and South America and the west Indies early in the \\ntwentieth century. This was identified as rabies only years later. The disease was shown \\nto be transmitted by vampire bats that sweep down on their prey at night. Vampire bat \\nrabies had taken a heavy toll of cattle. Vampire bats may shed the rabies virus as \\nsymptomless carries over a period of several months. \\nRabies is ehdemic in India. It has been estimated that more than 30,000 people die \\nof rabies in India every year and more than 700,000 receive antirabies vaccine. Human \\nrabies can be checked by control of rabies in domestic animals, by registration, licensing\"),\n",

Eradication of rabies from countries like India with abundant wildlife may \\nnot be practicable. \\nVaccination \\nPasteur introduced vaccination after exposure to rabies in 1885 on the basis that \\na long incubation period should allow time for immunity to develop before the onset of \\nsymptoms. His vaccine was a crude extract of rabbit spinal cord containing virus \"fixed \\nas a result of serial passage. A well publicized early success established the procedure, \\nstill in use despite various vicissitudes. A phenolized brain suspension formed the basis \\nof the sample vaccine, used in the UK from 1919 until 1966. Its drawbacks included a \\nvariable but generally low potency, which necessitated a considerable number of daily, \\noften painful, injections, with an antibody response mainly of the IgM class. There was \\nalso the disadvantage that the amount of myelin in its nervous tissue content sensitized \\na proportion of those being immunized, estimated to range from 1 in 500 upwards so \\nthat many went on to develop an allergic type of encephalomyelitis. When the risk of \\na possible exposure to a rabid animal was assessed as only marginal, it was matter of \\ndebate whether the risk of rabies was greatest than the risk of allegric encephalomyelitis. \\nA suckling mouse brain vaccine was developed and contains much less myelin. \\nIt is claimed to have a five fold reduction or more in the incidence of allegric \\nencephalomyelitis, and is widely used in latin American countries. A non-neurogenic duck \\nembryo vaccine was used in the UK from, 1966 to 1976. A purified version has shown \\nincreased potency, but this vaccine has been superseded by cell culture vaccines, of which \\nthere are several types.

Rotavirues \\nalso cause diarrhoea in the young of a wide variety of mammals and birds. In the early \\n1980s, a rotavirus (adult diarrhoea rotavirus, ADRV) was identified as the cause of \\noutbreaks of diarrhoea in children and adults in different parts of China. \\nMorphologically, rotaviruses are polyhedrons of 75 nm diameter displaying \\ncharacteristic sharp-edged double-shelled capsids, which in electron micrographs look like \\nspokes grouped around the hub of a wheel. The name 'rotavirus' was derived from this \\nappearance which is pathogenomic. More detailed structural studies have shown that \\nthe double-shelled capsid is penetrated by a large number of channels and that it \\ncarries on the surface of 60 protrusions that consist of dimers of VP4 (viral protein 4) \\nmolecules. \\nThe genome of rotaviruses is located inside the inner core and consists of 11 \\nsegments of double-stranded RNA that can be easily extracted from viruses and separated \\nby polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All segments, except one, code for only one virus\\xad\\nspecific protein (VP), and gene-protein assignments have been completed for several \\nrotavirus strains. \\nRNA segments 1, 2 and 3 code for the inner core proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3, \\nrespectively: VP2 is the main scaffolding protein (core layer). RNA segment 6 codes for \\nthe inner capsid protein, VP6 which forms a middle layer interacting with the core protein \\nVP2 and the outer capsid proteins. VP6 carries epitopes specifying groups & sub groups. \\nSo far, seven different groups (A-G) have been identified. For groups A-E complex lack \\nof serological cross-reactivity has been proven. Within a group, all viruses share common \\nVP6 antigens but may be further differentiated into sub groups. Thus, within group A \\nthere are at least four subgroups (I, II, I + II, non - I, non - II), which are identified by \\nspecific antisera and monoclonal antibodies. Most of the human rotavirues are of group \\nA; the Chinese ADRV is a group B; group C rotaviruses cause occasional outbreaks in \\nhumans. The outer capsid (third layer) is formed by two proteins, VP7 a glycoprotein \\n(encoded by RNA, 7, 8 or 9 depending on strain), and VP4 (encoded by RNA 4). Both \\nsurface proteins carry neutralization -specific epitopes that define serotypes. VP4 is post\\xad\\ntranslationally cleaved into the VP5 and VP8 subunits; proteolytic cleavage is essential \\nfor infectivity. Six non-structural proteins (NSP1-NSP6) are coded for by RNAs 5, 7, 8 \\nor 9 (depending on strain), 10 and 11 (encoding NSP5 + NSP6), and have various functions \\nduring replication, mainly in morphogenesis. \\nSo far, 14 different VP7-specific serotypes (G types, derived from glycoprotein) and \\nover 20 different VP4- specific types (P types, derived from protease-sensitive protein) have \\nbeen distinguished. Whilst the correlation between G serotypes and genotypes is complete, \\nnot all P types have been confirmed as serotypes yet, and therefore the P serotype \\ndesignation differs from the P genotype designation, e.g., strain Wa being designated as \\nA/human/Wa(GIP1A[8]) etc. As VP7 and VP4 are coded for by different RNA segments, \\nthey can segregate independently, and a large variety of different G-P-type combinations \\nof rotaviruses have been observed after reassortment in vitro and in nature in vivo.

Various minor \\ndifferences in the migration of corresponding segments have been recognized. These \\ndifferences have been utilizing extensively in epidemiological studies, but for many \\nsurveillance purposes and for vaccine development serological classification remains \\nessential. \\nPathogenesis and Immunity \\nRotaviruses replicate exclusively in the differentiated epithelial cells at the tips of \\nthe villi of the small intestine. New virus is produced after 10-12 h. Progeny virus is \\nreleased in large numbers into the intestinal lumen ready to infect other cells. Biopsies \\nshow atrophy of the villi with reactive crypt hyperplasia and lymphocytic infiltrates in \\nthe lamina propria. The cellular damage leads to malabsorption of nutrients, electrolytes \\nand water and the crypt hyperplasia to hypersecretion. An osmotic and secretory diarrhoea \\nwith vomiting and dehydration results. It has been established that the product of RNA \\n4, VP 4, holds a central position for replication, spread and pathogenicity of rotaviruses, \\nbut that products of other RNA segments also contribute to the development of disease. \\nIn particular NSP4 (encoded by RNA segment 10) has been recognized as a viral \\nenterotoxin. \\nThe infection is followed by a local, humoral and cell-mediated immune response \\nand is normally overcome within a week. Rotavirus-specific IgA enteric antibodies, which \\nare secreted into the gut, are the best known correlate of protection. Infection with one \\nserotype provides homotypic, and re-infection leads to partial heterotypic, protection. In \\nthe immunodeficient host, however, a persistent infection can occur with severe chromic \\ndiarrhoea. \\nClinical Symptoms \\nThe onset of symptoms is abrupt after a short incubation period of 1-2 days. \\nDiarrhoea and vomiting are seen in the majority of infected children and last for 2-6 days. \\nAlthough symptoms of respiratory tract infection are frequently observed at the time of \\nrotavirus infections, there is no evidence that rotaviruses replicate in the respiratory tract. \\nClinical symptoms can range from mild to very severe, in part depending on the rotavirus \\nstrain. Asymptomatic infections of neonates with 'nursery strains' are not uncommon. It \\nhas been estimated that about half of all gastro-enteritis cases' in children requiring \\nadmission to hospital are caused by rotaviruses. Infection has been detected in older \\nchildren and adults, but is usually asymptomatic. Only in the elderly have outbreaks of \\ndiarrhoea due to rotavirus infection been observed. Rotavirus infections can be life\\xad\\nthreatening if children are already malnourished. Five million children under the age of \\n2 years die from diarrhoeal disease in developing countries each year, rotavirus infections \\naccount for about 20% of these deaths.\"),\n",

However the availability of nucleotide sequences from a large number of \\nhuman and animal retroviruses has indicated that viruses referred to as oncoviruses \\nbelong to several distinct groups. In the new classification of retroviruses there are five \\ngroups, including two corresponding to the original lentiviruses and spumaviruses, a \\ngroup containing HTLV-1 and II and the BID group that contains a number of oncogenic \\nviruses from other animals. \\nThe human viruses HTLV-1 and HTLV-II are related to the simian viruses STLV-\\n1 and II that are widely distributed in old and New world monkeys . In common with \\nHTLV-I, they can cause lymphomas in some primates. \\nMorphology \\nHIV is a spherical enveloped virus, about 90-120 nm in diameter with a three layer \\nstructure. In the centre are two identical copies of ssRNA (9.2 kb each) associated with \\nreverse transcriptase and surrounded by an icosahedral capsid,. which in turn is \\nsurrounded by a matrix protein followed by a host cell membrane derived lipid bilayer \\nenvelope from which project 72 glycoprotein peplomers. The genome organization is \\nsimilar for all retroviruses in that their genomes contain in the same order the genes gag, \\npol and env, which code for the three groups of structural protein. The long terminal repeat \\nsequences (LTR) at both ends of the genome contain promoter and enhancer sequences. \\nThere are important differences between the types in the nature and arrangement of the \\ngenes involved in the regulation of the replication cycle. The genome of HIV contains three \\nmajor genes each coding for two or more polypeptides. The gag (group specific antigen) \\ngene encodes the core or capsid and matrix proteins, the pol gene encodes the reverse \\ntranscriptase (polymerase) and the env gene encodes the virion envelope peplomer protein \\nand transmembrane protein. HIV-1 is divided into 3 groups. HIV-1M (major group), HIV-\\n10 (outlier) and HIV-IN (new virus). HIV-IM comprises eight sub types or clades, \\ndesignated A,B, C, D, F, C, Hand J as well as four major circulating recombinant forms \\n(AE, AC, ACI, AB) India predominantly has HIV-1M sub type C. Sub types A and Bare \\nless frequent. However western developed countries have HIV-1M sub type B as predominant \\nsub type. Sub type C is usually acquired by heterosexual contact and subtype B by \\nhomosexual contact. HIV-2 has been divided in 5 sub types (A to E). There are at least \\nsix regulatory genes in HIV and at least two in HTLV-1. In HIV, tat codes for a protein \\nthat has a general stimulating effect on the synthesis of all viral proteins through its \\nbinding to a region in the LTR that promotes transcription of viral mRNAs. The rev gene \\nproduct has a regulatory effect, switching on viral protein synthesis by favouring the \\nproduction of full-length RNA molecules rather than the spliced RNA from the regulatory'),\n",

The env gene codes for \\na large protein that is glycosylated and cleaved to gp 41, the transmembrane protein and \\ngp 120, the external envelope glycoprotein present on the envelope as a trimer with many \\nglycosylation sites. Both HIV-1 and -2 show considerable sequence variability, which has \\nallowed their classification into a ilumber of sub types that show marked difference in \\ngeographical distribution and association with different risk groups. HIV variants are \\ncurrently classified into at least eight subtypes (A-H) that differ from each other by \\n20-30% in nucleotide sequence. In addition, in areas with more th~n one subtype in \\ncirculation, viruses with recombinant genomes have been described. \\nReplication \\nRetroviruses differ from other RNA viruses in that they replicate and produce viral \\nRNA from a DNA copy of the virion RNA. The best studied method of attachment of \\nHIV to cells is by the interaction of the external envelope glycoprotein gp 120 with part \\nof the CD4 molecule of T helper lymphocytes and other cells. Attachment is followed by \\ninteraction of tlle HIV envelope with a second (co-) receptor.

The CD4 molecule has binding avidity for gp 120 of HIV. \\nThen by pinocytosis, the nucleocapsid of the virion enters into host cell. The envelope \\nof the same does not enter into the cell. After entry into the cell, the nucleocapsid releases \\nits RNA into the cytoplasm. The viral reverse transcriptase, acting as an RNA dependent \\nDNA polymerase, makes a DNA copy of the genomic RNA. The ssDNA is made double\\xad\\nstranded by the same enzyme, now acting as a DNA-dependent DNA- polymerase. \\nThis dsDNA moves to the nucleus and several such molecules become integrated \\nas provirus at random sites in the host cell chromosome causing a latent infection. The \\nintegrated provirus is transcribed by cellular RNA polymerase II either for the production \\nof mRNAs which are translated into proteins or for the production of genomic RNA for \\ninsertion into progeny virions. \\nHIV establishes a latent infection with or without an initial productive phase. In \\nthis state, the integrated proviral DNA remains silent without transcription or expression \\nof most viral proteins. Certain factors, however, can activate the virus and convert the \\nlatent state into productive HIV infection. During viral replication, naked virus buds from \\nthe surface qf the infected cell and acquires a lipoprotein envelope which contains lipid \\nderived from the host cell membrane and glycoproteins which are virus-encoded. \\nPathogenesis \\nSince HIV infects cells expressing CD4 antigen, therefore, in the circulation the virus \\nis found in CD4+ T lymphocytes and also in monocyte-macrophage cells, which may act \\nas a reservoir for virus. Macrophage are also important in carrying the virus into the central \\nnervous system across the blood-brain barrier. Virus is also present in the plasma. It is \\nprobably derived from the lysis of activated lymphocytes. Within one month or so, viraemia \\ndeclines to a near undetectable level and illness subsidies. This is brought by CD8+ \\ncytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and antibody-dependent cell-mediated \\ncytotoxicity (ADCC). \\nThis is followed by a long asymptomatic period of 1-15 years (average 10 years). \\nDuring this period, only a small number of circulating CD4+ cells are producing virus \\nand only low titres of virus are present in the blood. However, many infected cells can \\nbe detected in the lymph nodes. Follicular hyperplasia develops in these and other \\nlumphoid organs. When CD4+ T cell count falls below 400/ ilL, a large number of virions \\nspill over from the degenerating lymph nodes into the blood and opportunistic infections \\nwith various microorganisms may develop. Cause of death is the opportunistic infections, \\nmalignancy and cachexia-like state. Fall in CD4+ T cell count is d~e to: \\n1. Viral cytolysis of CD4+ T cells. \\n2. Infected CD4+ T cell can fuse, via. gp 120, with up to 100 uninfected CD4+ \\nT cells forming a unit called syncytium. This will lead to the death of the entire \\nunit.'),\n",

The incubation period in the acute \\nstage is from 1 to 2 months. This is preceded by a period of intense, unrestrained viral \\nreplication, reflected in the presence of high numbers of viral RNA genomes and p24 \\nantigen in the circulation. After entering the body, virus is taken up by cells such as \\ndendritic cells that carry the viral receptors. Within 24-48 h infected cells are present in \\nthe regional lymph nodes; virus can be detected in the blood and circulating lymphocytes \\nby 5 days. As the immune system responds, both p 24 antigen and RNA copy number \\ndecrease, so that by 6-12 months p24 antigen is usually undetectable and the RNA load \\nhas stabilized at a lower level; in some it may be undetectable.

The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA is 99.7% and 95% or \\nmore respectively.

A few recombinants have been isolated from \\nareas in the East. \\nThe existence of different sub types of HIV, and recombinants, is important for two \\nreasons. Firstly, assays for anti-HIV and viral nucleic acid must be able to recognize all \\ntypes. Secondly, vaccine developers must take account of the various types and establish \\nthe spectrum of protection of candidate vaccines. \\nCONTROL \\nSexual Transmission \\nUntil a vaccine is available, the emphasis in controlling the spread of infection must \\nbe on risk reduction by avoiding unprotected penetrative intercourse with partners of \\nunknown status. Despite knowledge of the major routes of infection, there has only been \\nlimited success in reducing sexual transmission. Globally the problem is enormous and \\nefforts are hampered by the poverty and lack of resources of the countries worst affected. \\nThe use of condoms and vaginal antiseptics could have an impact, but they need to be \\navailable and acceptable to the local population. \\nIn the areas of the world with low levels of infection early efforts to encourage safe \\npractices had an effect on the spread of the virus among gay men in the Americas and \\nEurope, but this was not always maintained as the perception of the risks changed as \\na result of declining rates of infection and, more recently, as the latest therapies appeared \\nto be succeeding and prolonging survival. Also, it is difficult to persuade the heterosexual \\nmajority that safe practices are relevant to them. \\nMother to Child Transmission \\nThis can be reduced by identifying infected mothers & giving specific therapy in \\nthe later stages of pregnancy and to the baby after birth. It has been shown that zidovudine \\nalone can reduce the transmission rate by a factor of three if given: \\n• Orally to the mother from weeks 14 to 34 of the pregnancy. \\n• Intravenously to the mother during labour pain. \\n• Orally to the child for 6 weeks after delivery. \\nIf the mother is already being treated, zidovudine should be part of her treatment, \\neven if she has had it before, transplacental transfer of the drug is important, perhaps \\naided by phosphorylation of the drug in the placenta.

After infecting mucosal cells in upper respiratory tract without \\nproducing symptoms it spread to the regional lymph node and after a transient viraemia, \\ninfected cells throughout the body. Multiplic,!tion of virus in these cells led to a second \\nand more intense viraemia which heralded the onset of clinical illness. During first few \\ndays of fever the virus multipled in skin epithelial cells, leading to the development of \\nfocal lesions and characteristic rash.

The last case of variola minor occurred \\nin Merca, Somalia in October 1977. The incubation period is around 12 days. \\n3. Morphology \\nPoxviruses are the largest animal viruses. They are large enough to be seen by light \\nmicroscopy after special staining procedures. In most genera, the virions are brick-shaped \\nwith rounded corners, measuring 250 x 200 x 200 nm in size. They are known as complex \\nviruses. Pox viruses have a biconcave dumb-bell-shaped DNA core and two lateral bodies \\nenclosed in a protein shell about 12 nm thick. It is known as outer membrane, surface \\nof which consists of irregularly arranged tubules. Virions released from the cells are \\nenclosed within an envelope which consists of host cell lipids and several virus-specified \\npolypeptides, including the haemagglutinin. Their DNA genome range in mass from 85 \\nM Da (parapoxvirus) to 185 M Da (avipoxviruses). The vaccinia virus genome has 186.000 \\nbase pairs (123 MDa). The pox virus genome is distinct in that covalent links join the \\ntwo DNA strands at both ends of the molecule, the genome thus being a single \\nuninterrupted molecule that is folded to form a linear duplex structure. The characteristic \\nfeatures is, identical sequences being present at each end of the genome. \\n4. Physical and Chemical Properties \\nPox virus are stable and if protected from sunlight may remain viable for months \\nat room temperature. In the cold or when freeze dried, they survive for years. They are \\nsusceptible to UV light and other irradiations. They are resistant to 50% glycerol and 1 % \\nphenol but readily inactivated by formation or oxidizing disinfectants. The virion contains \\na multiplicity of enzymes and entire multiplication of virus takes place in the cytoplasm \\nof infected cell. All pox virus share a common nucleoprotein antigen. \\n5. CONTROL OF SMALL POX \\nBefore Vaccination \\nBefore the introduction of vaccination, the control of small pox relied on two \\napproaches, variolation and isolation. Variolators aimed to induce immunity equivalent \\nto that after natural infection. Susceptible individuals were deliberately infected with \\nsmallpox pus or scabs by scratching the skin or by nasal insufflation. Although the virus \\nwas not attenuated, infections had lower case fatality rates and were less likely to cause \\npermanent pock marks than those acquired naturally. Variolation was first recorded in \\nChina nearly 1000 years ago, and was practiced in many parts of the world. Variolators'),\n",

In Afghanistan, Pakistan and Ethiopia their activities \\ncaused problems towards the end of the small-pox eradication programme in the 1970s \\nbecause they spread virus in a way that evaded the measures erected to control natural \\nvirus transmission. \\nVaccination \\nEdward Jenner vaccinated James Phipps with cowpox virus on 14 May 1796 and \\nchallenged him by variolation some months later. He repeated this 'trial', as he called \\nit, in other children, and the description of these events in his 'Inquiry' in 1798 led to \\nthe rapid world wide acceptance of vaccination. Introduction of the vaccine virus into \\nthe epidermis led to the development of a local lesion and the induction of a strong \\nimmunity to infection with small pox virus that lasted for several years. Although the \\nessentials of Jennerian vaccination remained unchanged for the rest of its history, early \\nvaccinators developed their own vaccine viruses, which became known as vaccinia. The \\norigin of these viruses is obscure, and modern vaccinia viruses form a distinct species \\nof orthopoxvirus, related to but very clearly distinct from the viruses of both cowpox and \\nsmallpox. \\nSmall pox was brought under control by: \\n1. routine vaccination of children-compulsory in some countries \\n2. Odtbreak control by isolation and selective vaccination \\nThis was achieved gradually in Europe, the former USSR, North and Central \\nAmerica, and Japan, and the virus had been eradicated from all these areas by the mid-\\n1950s. In 1959 this achievement prompted the world health organization (WHO) to adopt \\nthe global eradication of smallpox as a major goal. At this time 60% of the world's \\npopulation lived in areas where small pox was endemic. A slow reduction in disease \\nwas maintained for the next few years, but epidemics continued to be frequent. \\nConsequently the WHO initiated its intensified small pox eradication programme. This \\nstarted on 1st January 1967 when the disease was reported in 31 countries. It had the \\ngoal of eradication within 10 years. The goal was achieved in 10 years, 9 months and \\n26 days. From a starting point of 10 million to 15 million cases annually and against \\na background of civil strife, famine and floods, success came because of a major \\ninternational collaborative effort-aided by some virus-specific factors. At the beginning \\nof 1976 small pox occurred only in Ethiopia. Transmission was interrupted there in \\nAugust of that year, although an importation of virus into Somalia and adjacent \\ncountries had occurred by then. This was the last outbreak. The last case occurred on \\n26 October 1977. In the final years of the programme its emphasis moved from mass \\nvaccination to a strategy of surveillance and containment. This strategy rapidly interrupted \\ntransmission because: \\n.

These agents were termed \\'Simian viruses\\' one of them that induced a vacuolated \\nor foamy appearance in the cytoplasm was termed SV 40. \\nPolyomaviruses: SV 40 \\nSome viruses of the polyomavirus family induce tumors in animals. One of these \\nDNA tumor viruses was first isolated from monkeys, and it was thus called simian virus \\n40 or SV40. Virus SV 40 was one of the first genetic elements to be studied by genetic \\nengineering techniques and has been extensively used as a vector for moving genes into \\neukaryotic cells. \\nThe SV 40 virion is a non enveloped particle 45 nm in diameter with an icosahedral \\nhead containing 72 protein subunits. Unlike RNA viruses, there are no enzymes in the \\nvirion. The genome of SV 40 consists of one molecule of double-stranded DNA of 5243 \\nbp. The DNA is circular and exist in a supercoiled configuration within the virion. The \\ncomplete base sequences of SV 40 has been determined. \\nSV 40 nucleic acid is replicated in the nucleus, while the proteins are synthesized \\nin the cytoplasm. Final assembly of the virion occurs in the nucleus.\" The replication of \\nthese viruses can be divided into two distinct stages, early and late. During the early stage, \\nthe early region of the viral DNA is transcribed. A single RNA molecule, the primary \\ntranscript, is made by cellular RNA polymerase, but it is processed into two mRNAs, a \\nlarge one and a small one. Introns are present in the SV40 genome, so they are excised \\nout of the primary RNA transcript. In the cytoplasm, the mRNAs are capped and translated \\nto yield two proteins. One of these proteins, the T-antigen, binds to the site on the parental \\nDNA that is the origin of replication, this initiates viral genome synthesis. \\nThe genome of SV40 is too small to encode its own DNA polymerases, so host DNA \\npolymerases are used. Replication occurs in a bidirectional fashion from a single origin \\nof replication. The process involves the same events that have already been described for \\nhost cell DNA replication. \\nLate SV40 mRNA molecules are synthesized using the strand complementary to that \\nused for early mRNA synthesis. Transcription begins at a promoter near the origin of \\nreplication. This late RNA is then processed by splicing, capping, and polyadenylation \\nto yield mRNA corresponding to the three coat proteins, VP1, VP2, and VP3. SV 40 coat \\nprotein mRNAs are then transported to the cytoplasm and translated into the viral coat \\nproteins. The latter are then transported back into the nucleus where virion assembly takes \\nplace. Release of new SV40 virions occurs by cell lysis. Within the permissive monkey \\ncells two genes are expressed immediately after infection. These early genes represent two \\ntumour causing antigens, namely small tumour (t) and a large tumour (T) proteins. \\nSome polyomaviruses cause cancer. When a virus of the polyomavirus group infects \\na host cell, one of two modes of replication can occur, depending on the type of host \\ncell. In some types of host cells, known as permissive cells, virus infection results in the \\nusual formation of new virions and the lysis of the host cell. In other types of host cells,'),\n",

Type F had been proposed for a putative virus believed to cause transfusion \\nassociated hepatitis. \\nHepatitis virus are taxonomically unrelated except type B. Which is a DNA virus \\nall others are RNA virus. The differentiation is based on their serological and molecular \\nmarkers. Hepatitis F proved to be a mutant of type B virus and not a separate entity. \\nTherefore, it has been deleted from the list of hepatitis viruses. Non viral causes of hepatitis \\ninclude Leptospira, Treponema pallidum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Toxoplasma gondii and \\nEntamoeba histolytica. In the United States, hepatitis B, A and C account for about 40%, \\n30% and 20% respectively. In about 2% cases, hepatitis D occurs in concert with hepatitis \\nB. Only a handful of hepatitis E cases are reported every year, none originating in the \\nUnited States. All are in travellers coming back from countries where the virus is endemic. \\nAll types of viral hepatitis produce clinically similar illnesses. These range from \\nasymptomatic and inapparent to fulminant and fatal acute infections common to all types, \\non one hand, and from sub clinical persistent infections to rapidly progressive liver disease \\nwith cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma, common to the blood-borne types (HBV, \\nHCV & HDV), on the other. Without specific virological tests, it is not possible to determine \\nwhich hepatitis virus is responsible for a case of hepatitis. On the basis of epidemiological \\nand clinical criteria, two types of viral hepatitis are known one type occurred sporadically \\nor as epidemics, affecting mainly children and young adults and transmitted by fecal\\xad\\noral route. This is called infective or infectious hepatitis called type A hepatitis. Second \\ntype of viral hepatitis, transmitted mainly by inoculation was originally observed in \\npersons receiving serum inoculation or blood transfusion called as serum jaundice, serum \\nhepatitis transfusion hepatitis called as type B hepatitis. Soon a type C virus was identified \\nas causing many transfusion associated hepatitis cases. A defective virus which depends \\non the helper functions of type B virus was called delta or type D hepatitis viruses another \\ntype of hepatitis transmitted by the facial oral route prevalent only in developing nations \\nis due to E virus. The sixth member of this group hepatitis G virus can also cause hepatitis \\nbut its role is not yet been understood. \\nBoth HA V & HEV are shed in high titres in the faeces of infected individuals.

It can be transmitted to chimpanzes and several \\nspecies of marmoset monkeys and can be grown in cell cultures of primate and human \\ncells. HAVis the only one of the human hepatitis viruses that can be cultivated in vitro. \\nPathogene'sis \\nHAV is shed early in the stools of infected individuals, 1-2 weeks prior to the onset \\nof symptoms, and persists for the first several days after the transaminase levels peak. \\nThere is very little virus in the serum and hardly any at all in other body fluids which \\nexplains the epidemiology of the disease as faecal-oral enteric infection. Transfusion\\xad\\nassociated hepatitis A is exceedingly rare. It probably multiplies first in the intestinal \\nepithelial cells and then spreads to the liver via the blood. Viral antigens can be seen \\nin the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. \\nHA V occurs throughout the world and is endemic in countries with substandard \\nhygiene and sanitation, so the vast majority of native population have detectable anti\\xad\\nHAV by the age of 10 years.

In \\nthe former, infection occurs mostly in adolescents and young adults through contaminated \\nsyringes and needles, typically among drug addicts, and through sex, particularly by \\nhomosexual intercourse. In the poor countries, infection occurs usually at younger ages, \\neither perina tally from mother to baby, or horizontally among children. \\nNatural infection occurs only in humans.

A carriers is a person with detectable HBsAg in blood \\nfor more than 6 months. Following infection, about 5-10% of adults, 30% of children and \\n90% of neonates become carriers.

Most of the HBV infections are \\nsubclinical, particularly in childhood. \\nThe course of acute HBV infection can be divided into three phases: preicteric, icteric \\nand convalescent. \\n(A) Preicteric (prodromal) phase: After an incubation period of 6 weeks to 6 months \\npatient develops malaise, anorexia, weakness, myalgia, nausea, vomiting and pain in the . \\nright upper abdominal quadrant. A minority of patients develop arthralgia, urticarial or \\nmaculopapular rash, polyarteritis nodosa and glomerulonephritis. These features may be \\nrelated to circulating immune complexes. \\n(B) Icteric phase: Two days to two weeks following the initial symptoms patient \\ndevelops jaundice, pale stools and dark urine (bilirubinuria). Hepatocellular damage is \\ndetectable biochemically before the onset of jaundice and persists after it has resolved. \\n(C) Convalescent phase: This phase is long and drawn out with malaise and fatigue \\nlasting for several weeks. The duration of uncomplicated hepatitis is rarely more than \\n8-10 weeks, but mild symptoms may persist for more than one year. The incubation period \\nis long (1-6 months). About 90-95% of adults with acute hepatitis B infection recover within \\n1-2 months of onset and eliminate the virus from the body within about 6 months \\nremaining immune thereafter. Mortality is 0.5 -2% but may be more in post transfusion \\ncases. \\nHBV infection occurs virtually in every country of the world. The carrier rate in \\nIndia is estimated to be 5%. Mild cases that do not result in jaundice are termed anicteric. \\nLess than 1 % of the iceteric cases die of fulminant hepatitis, 90-95% recover with complete \\nregeneration of the damaged liver within 2-3 months. The remaining patients progress \\nto chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatoma cells often \\ncontain HBV DNA, but the patient is usually negative for HBcAg and other indications \\nof ongoing viral replication. Integration of HBV DNA fragments into the hepatocyte \\ngenome is a frequent event during HBV infection. \\nHepatitis B carriers \\nHBV replicates within hepatocytes viral DNA exist in hepatocyte nucleus in the \\nfree extrachromosomal state or integrated with the cell chromosome. DNA is synthesized \\nfrom an RNA template by reverse transcriptase. \\nAbout 5-10% of HBV infections result in chronic carrier state. The latter may be \\ndefined as persistence of HBsAg in the circulation for more than six months. Carriers \\nare of two types: \\n1. Super carriers: They have HBeAg, high titres of HBsAg and DNA polymerase \\nin their blood. HBV may also be demonstrable in their blood. Very minute amount of serum \\nor blood from such carriers can transmit the infection. \\n2. Simple carriers: These are more common types of carriers who have low level \\nof HBsAg and no HBeAg, HBV and DNA polymerase in the blood. They transmit the \\ninfection only when large volumes of blood are transferred as in blood transfusion.'),\n",

A comparison \\nof HCV genomic sequences from around the world has shown substantial heterogeneity \\nof nucleotide sequences within several regions of the viral genomes. On the basis of these \\ngenomic differences, HCV has been classified into 11 genotypes and each genotype has \\nseveral subtypes. This makes vaccine development difficult.

HCV is reported to be an important cause \\nof chronic liver disease in South India. \\nIncubation period of hepatitis C averages 6-8 weeks though it may range upto several \\nmonths. About 75% infections are subclinical. The danger from hepatitis C is not the acute \\ndisease but the persistence of infection. As compared to hepatitis B, clinical infection with \\nhepatitis C is generally less severe, has shorter preicteric period, milder symptoms, absent \\nor less marked jaundice, somewhat lower serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels \\nand the case-fatality rate from fulminant hepatitis is 1 % or less. \\nHowever, 85% or more of the acute HCV infections become chronic.

However, coinfection with HBV and HDV may be more severe than the disease \\ncaused by HBV alone. \\n2. Superinfection of an HBsAg carrier by HDV. It is commoner and more serious \\nbecause a large number of hepatocytes are already producing HBsAg, and HDV can \\nreplicate without delay with a relatively short incubation period. It leads to severe liver \\ndamage, fulminant HBsAg positive hepatitis and elevated mortality (upto 20%) \\nIn simultaneous acute HBV & HDV infections, IgM anti-HBc will be detectable, while \\nin acute HDV infection superimposed on chronic HBV infections, anti-HBc will be of IgG \\nclass. \\nLaboratory Diagnosis \\nIn patients with HBV-HOV coinfections, shortly before tlle end of incubation period, \\nHBsAg appears in the serum and towards the end of incubation period HDAg appears \\nwhich can be detected by ELISA or immunoblotting and HDA RNA can be detected by \\nhybridization to a radio labeled RNA probe.

The plasma membrane lipids of archaebacteria have branched chain \\nhydrocarbon attached to glycerol by ether links rather than fatty acid connected by ester \\nlinks as in eubacteria. Sometimes two glycerol groups are linked to form an extremely \\nlong tetraethers. Glycerol diethers and glycerol tetraethers are major classes of lipid \\npresent in archaebacteria. \\nThe lipids are polar lipids which are present in archaebacterial membrane like \\nphospholipids, sulfolipids and glycolipids. About 7-30% of membrane lipids are nonpolar \\nlipids (the derivative of squalene). The C 20 diethers can be used to make a regular bilayer \\nmembrane while a more rigid monolayer membrane is constructed of C 40 tetraethers \\nlipids which increases the membrane's mechanical strength and resistance to chemical \\nagent. \\nIn thermoacidophiles one or two cyclopentane ring commonly occurs in C 40 chains \\nand two-OH (adjacent) groups on glycerol moiety are ether linked to these hydrocarbon \\nchains. Thus archaebacterial membranes may contain a mix of diethers, tetraethers and \\nother lipids like thermoacidophiles contain many dibiphytanyl tetraethers, halophiles \\ncontain many diphytanyl diethers and methanagens contain both diphytanyl diethers \\nand dibiphytanyl tetra ethers. The presence of ether linked lipid is such a unique \\ncharacteristic of archaebacteria that this distinctive feature has been used as a biomarker \\nfor detecting archaebacteria in paleontological studies of rocks, sediments cores and other \\nfossil materials.\"),\n",

The second edition of \\nBergey's Manual divides the archaea into two phyla the Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota \\neach with several orders. The classification was based on rRNA data. The term \\nCrenarchaeota [Greek Crene, spring or fount and archaeos) and Euryarchaeota [Greek \\nEurus wide and = archaios = ancient or primitive) divided the archaea at the phyla \\nlevel. The Crenarchaeote are thought to resemble the ancestor of the archaea and almost \\nall the species are thermophiles or hyperthermophiles. The phylum Crenarchaeota is \\ndivided into one class. Thermoprotei and four order Thermoproteales, Sulfolobales, \\nDesulfurococcales and Calidisphaerales. \\nThermoproteales contains Gram-ve, anaerobic to facultative hyperthermophilic rods. \\nThey often grow chemolithoautotrophically by reducing sulphur to hydrogen sulfide. \\nMembers of the order Sulfolobales are coccus shaped thermoacidophiles. The order \\nDesulfurococcales contain Gram negative coccoid or disk shaped hyperthermophiles. \\nThey grow either chemolithotrophically by hydrogen oxidation or organotrophically by \\neither fermentation or respiration with sulphur as the electron acceptor. \\nThe Euryarchaeotes are given the name because they occupy different ecological \\nniches and have a variety of metabolic patterns. This phylum is very diverse with seven \\nclasses. (Methanobacteria, Methanococci, Halobacteria, Thermoplasmata, Thermococci, \\nArchaeglobi and Methanopyri), nine orders and 15 families. Methanogens are the \\ndominant physiological group and largest group with a great practical importance \\nbecause methane is a clean burning fuel and an excellent energy source. \\nPHYLUM-CRENARCHAEOTA \\nMost of the Crenarchaeotes are extremely thermophilic and many are acidophilic \\nand sulphur dependent. Almost all are strict anaerobes. They grow in geothermally \\nheated water or soils that contain elemental sulphur. The sulphur may be used either \\nas an electron acceptor in aerobic respiration or as an e- source by lithotrophs. The \\nmembers are scattered all over the world for ego the sulphur rich hot springs in \\nYellowstone National park, Wyoming and water surrounding areas of submarine \\nvolcanic activity. Such habitats are called Solfatara. These archaea can be very \\nthermophilic and often are classified as hyperthermophiles. The phylum include a single \\nclass Thermoprotei, with 4 orders, Thermoproteales, Calidisphaerales, Desulfurococales \\nand Sulfoiobaies. \\nThermoproteus the member of order Thermoproteales is a long thin rod that can \\nbe bent or branched. Its cell wall is composed of glycoprotein. It is strict anaerobic and \\ngrows at temperature from 70-97°C and pH values between 2.5 to 6.5. It is found in \\nhot springs and other hot aquatic habitats rich in sulfur. It can grow organotrophically \\nand oxidize glucose, amino acids, alcohols and organic acids with elemental sulfur as \\nthe electron acceptor. CO or CO 2 act as sole carbon source. \\nSulfolobus is a facultative chemoautotroph found extensively all over the world in \\nhot acid springs and soils. The cells are irregularly lobate spherical.

The salt lakes occur in arid regions where evaporation exceeds fresh water inflow, \\nor a lake which is fed by a salt spring. The cell wall of these organism is so dependent \\non the presence of NaCl that it disintegrate when NaCl concentration drops to about \\n1.5 M.

This idea led to the discovery of pleomorphic, wall free \\nprokaryotic endoparasites residing in the phloem of diseased plants. Cell wall free \\nprokaryotes infecting plants were previously termed as \"Mycoplasma like Organisms\" or \\nII MLOs\" , because of their structural resemblance to mycoplasma. Mycoplasmas cause \\nvarious kinds of disorders in humans and animals and are sensitive to tetracycline and \\npenicillin both, whereas MLOs are sensitive to tetracycline only. In contrast to mycoplasma, \\nthe plant parasitic MLOs cannot be cultured in vitro in cell free media.

Phytoplasmas have not yet been grown in vitro on cell free nutrient \\nmedia in the laboratories. All efforts to culture these microorganisms under artificial \\nconditions have been failed. Phytoplasmas are maintained in the host plants. This can \\nbe achieved by tissue culture techniques, by grafting infected twigs on susceptible plants, \\nor by insect transmission. \\nDetection \\nUnlike typical bacteria, phytoplasmas cannot be cultured on artificial media in the \\nlaboratory. However, they can be determined with phytoplasma-specific stains such as \\nDAPI (4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) a nucleic acid stain, which stain bacteria in phloem. \\nDienes\\' stain is metabolized by phytoplasmas that produces blue colour.

Phytoplasmas are \\ndetected by grafting infected twigs to susceptible host plants such as Periwinkle (Catharallthus \\nroseus). These can also be detected using light or electron microscopy, molecular techniques \\nincluding DNA probes, enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assays (ELISA) and DNA \\namplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). \\nVectors \\nPhytoplasma vector species belong to hemipters that are phloem-feeding insects. \\nThree families Oassidea, Cixidae and Psyllidae) contain the known vector species.

It is considered that phytoplasmas are not transmitted vertically to the progeny \\nof infected specimen. Among plant hoppers, species in the cixiid family are known to \\ntransmit phytoplasma belonging to \"stolbur\" group. Among psyllids, several species have \\nbeen shown to transmit diseases of fruit trees. Leafhoppers, and psyllids are the most \\ncommon vectors of phytoplasma. \\nSpread and Transmission \\nPhytoplasmas are completely dependent on their host for existence, as these as \\nobligate endoparasites. They live in phloem of the plants. Phytoplasmas generally move \\nto a new area by grafting, planting infected cuttings, by parasitic plants such as Dodder \\n(Cuscuta Spp) and by leafhoppers, which migrate annually. Phytoplasmas are phloem\\xad\\nlimited and cannot be transmitted through seeds. It is unlikely that phytoplasmas could \\nsurvive the desiccation usually associated with seed formation. \\nDisease Symptoms \\nSymptoms on plants include virescence (the development of green flowers), phyllody'),\n",

Almost all brinjal varieties are susceptible to this disease. The \\ndisease is a serious threat for the crop grown. When young plants are attacked they do \\nnot produce flowers and fruits. The disease can cause upto 64% reduction in plant \\nproductivity. The mycoplasma can affect at least 13 plants genera in 5 families include \\ncultivated and wild egg plants, datura, tomato, tobacco etc. \\nSymptoms \\nThe main symptom is production of very short and small leaves. The petioles are \\nso much reduced in size become narrow, soft, smooth and yellowish in colour. Newly \\nformed leaves are further reduced in size. The inter node become shortened and at the \\nsame time large number of axillary buds are stimulated to grow into short branches with \\nsmall leaves. This gives the plant a bushy appearance and plant fail to form flowers and \\neven if flowers are formed they remain green and leaf like. Virescent (a coloured tissue \\nthat develops chloroplast and becomes green), and phylloid flowers (floral coloured parts \\ndevelop chloroplast and become green) is common fruit setting is seldom. \\nVerma et al. (1969) showed that the disease symptoms are associated with MLO's \\n(now phytoplasma). MLB's were described as spherical to ovoid structure (40-300 nm) \\nand were present in the phloem cells of diseased plants. The phytoplasma are also seen \\nin the body organs of vectors. \\nIn nature the causal agent of the disease is transmitted by the leaf hopper vector \\nCestius phycitis and also by Empoasca devastans. Vector acquire MLO's after several days \\nof feeding and transmit MLO's after an incubation period of 10-45 days. The incubation \\nperiod is required for the multiplication and distribution of MLO's in the insect body. \\nDuring the off season of brinjal crop the causal agent survives on weed hosts (Solanum \\nxallthocarpum) and then it is transmitted to the main crop by the insect vectors. Bitter gourd, \\nwater melon, carrot, sunhemp are good hosts of the vector and beet, castor, soybean are \\nsuitable for oviposition. \\nControl \\nNo effective control measures against the pathogen is known. Antibiotic treatment \\nwith tetracycline is reported to control the disease eradication of weed hosts and diseased \\nbrinjal plants and control of insect vectors by insecticide is the only recommendations \\nin India.

Thus cyanophyta \\n(= Cyanophyceae) are called cyanobacteria and Prochlorophyta (= Prochlorophyceae) \\nare termed Prochlorobacteria. \\nThe Division - Cyanophyta (Cyanobacteria) are the blue greens, the most primitive \\nof algal organisms. They have existed on the surface of the earth since the early \\nPrecambrian. Blue green algae are kept under the class myxophycae or cyanophyceae of \\nthe algae division. They are commonly called as blue-green algae due to the presence \\nof water soluble accessory photosynthetic pigments named C-phycocyanin and C\\xad\\nphycoerythrin which impart blue-green colour to the algae. Along with this certain \\ncharacteristics Xanthophylls viz myxoxanthin, and myxoxanthophyll, oscillaxanthin, \\nzeaxanthin are present in addition to chlorophyll -a and 13 - carotene etc. Fritsch (1945) \\nclassified the blue green algae into class myxophycae.

Majority of genera are found \\nboth in fresh as well as in brackish (saltish) water. \\nHigh temperature, intense light and humid environment is required for the growth \\nof thallus. According to Desikachari (1959) about 160 genera and 1500 species are \\nreporated from the tropical areas. In India the members are represented by 85 genera \\nand 750 species. The members of blue green algae are found in hot and humid \\nenvironment, moist or alkaline land, along with this they require high intensity of light. \\nThe members of blue green algae grow extensively in the paddy fields of tropical and \\ntemperate climate region eg-Anabaena, Nostoc, Tolypothrix, and Cylindrospermum grow \\nactivily and fix atmospheric nitrogen. \\nSome members of cyanobacteria are found in fresh water lakes, ponds and various \\ntypes of water reservoirs. Many members grow extensively on the surface of fresh water \\nand form water blooms. eg-MicrOCljstis and Arthospira. Such algae growth emit bad odour \\nand render water obnoxious and undrinkable. \\nSome blue green algae when abundant, may also impart their colour to water. For \\nego Trichodesmium erythraeum is responsible for red colour of the red sea.

The outer layer bears cellulose, hemi-cellulose, muramic \\nacid and amino acids while the inner membrane had alanine, glucosamine, glutamic \\nacid and dipicholinic acid. The longitudinal wall of Oscillatoria bears pores. Some \\nendosymbionts viz.

These vesicles are bound by \\nsingle membrane. The membrane is permeable to common gases. Fogg (1972) has shown \\nthat the gas-vacuoles are more commonly \\nproduced under low intensity of light and \\nthen suddenly collapse under high intensity \\nof light. This results due to increased rate of \\nphotosynthesis which produces more quantity \\nof sugar and increases the osmotic pressure \\nso that there is a quick collapse of the gas- Cell wall \\nvacuoles at the surface level of water in the Plasmalemma \\nplanktonic species. After collapse the filaments \\nsink down at the bottom of water-reservoir. \\nThus gas vacuoles have a great ecological \\nimportance and serve to regulate the \\nbuoyancy of the planktonic forms. According \\nto Pringsheim (1966) the gas vacuoles are \\nproduced under anaerobic conditions in \\nOscillatoria agardltii. \\n(II) Heterocyst \\nCertain members of the genera \\nNostocales and Stigonematales (which include \\nfilamentous forms) except Oscillatoriales \\nproduce enlarged, thick walled, pale yellowish \\nspecialized cells in addition to the vegetative Fig. 3 : Ultrastructure of heterocyst'),\n",

The reserve food \\nmaterial is stored in the form of cyanophycean starch (a product of photosynthesis). \\nSimon (1971) suggest that these cyanophycean starch granules are made up of \\npolypeptide which contains only two amino acids viz. Arginine and Aspartic acid. \\nThe capacity of cyanobacteria to assimilate and metabolise exogenous organic \\ncompound is very limited and they can't use organic compounds as a source of energy. \\nMovements: Despite the fact that blue green algae lack flagellated motile cells yet \\nsome genera like Oscillatoria, Spirulina and other show creeping or gliding movement \\nin longitudinal direction of the longitudinal axis of a filament when in contact with \\na solid or semi-solid substrate. The movement is also accompanied by a clockwise or \\nanti clock wise rotation of a trichome and is specific for a species. The filaments are \\nusually in contact with a solid or semisolid substratum and their free ends show a slow \\nor jerky but pendulum like oscillations. In Oscillatoriaceae the velocity of movement \\nis usually well over 2 ~m sec-I and ranges up to 11 ~m sec-I. The path covered by filament \\nis not straight but a curved one.\"),\n",

Sexual reproduction is absent however genetic \\nrecombination has been reported by Kumar (1962) and Bazin (1968). Shestakov and \\nKhyen (1970) have reported genetic recombination in Allacystis ridulalls. \\nVegetative Reproduction \\nIt is generally by fission, fragmentation and by the formation of hormogonia. \\n(i) Fission: The unicellular cyanophyceae (ex. SYllecllOcystis) reproduce by this \\nmethod called binary fission. This is the chief method of multiplication in the unicellular \\nforms. The nuclear division (either by amitosis or mitosis) precedes the cell division. \\nThis is followed by cytokinesis. Under E.M. the cytokinesis reveals in filamentous algae \\nas the involution of plasma membrane. This involution latter grows inward in the middle \\nof the cell forming a_ cross plate between the two halves of the nuclear material. This \\ndivides the protoplast into two equal halves. With the centripetal growth of the cell \\nmembrane a ring-like septum arises from the inner layer of the cell wall and gradually \\ngrows inwards like a diphram with a decreasing aperture splitting the cross plate into \\ntwo layers. Each daughter protoplast comes to possess a continuous plasma membrane. \\nThe completed septum or cross wall then thickens and finally divides into two layers, \\nthe ends of which are continuous with the inner layer of the parent cell wall. A \\nconstriction appears at the surface of the cross wall of the dividing cell exposing the \\nfission between the daughter cells externally. As the daughter cells grows they set up \\nthe turgar pressure which pulls on their walls at the region of contact. The separation \\nof daughter cells thus start at the periphery which proceeds towards the axis of the \\ndividing cell gradually separating the two-daughter cells functioning as independent \\nindividuals. \\n(2) Fragmentation: This plays an important role in non-filamentous and filamentous \\ncolonies. Reaching a certain size, the colony breaks up into small parts. Each part/ \\nfragment is the beginning of a new colony which increases in size by repeated cell \\ndivision. \\nThe fragmentation may also occur by mechanical means. It may result from the \\nbites of the animals feeding on trichomes or stress caused by water currents or death \\nof certain cells. \\n(3) Hormogonia: The trichomes of filamentous genera breaks up within the \\ngelatinous sheath into short sections or segments of one-many uniform living cells. These \\nshort length cells of trichome are called hormogonia or hormogones. The hormogones \\nare delimited either by the formation of heterocyst or by the development of bi-concave \\nseparation disc or necridia (dead cell). \\nIn genera with terminal or no heterocysts the hormogonia are delimited by the \\nformation from time to time of bi-concave, gelatinous separation discs (necridia) between \\nsome of the cells of the trichome. A living cell here and there in the trichome undergo \\nlysis. Its protoplast breaks down to form viscous substance. The mucilage filled dead'),\n",

These spore like structure contain the entire \\nprotoplast of the cell and have the original parent cell wall as tile outer portion of the \\nspore wall. \\nSeenayya and Suba Raju (1970) observed that phosphorous deficiency of water \\nresulted in increased production of akinete bearing trichomes in Annbaenopsis raciborskii. \\nThese akinetes are modified ordinary vegetative cells.

Prior to emergence through \\nthe end of the softened or ruptured akinete wall the protoplast may undergo many \\ntransverse divisions or it may not undergo the first transverse division and protrudes \\nout of the ruptured wall. The germling (the filamentous forms) behaves like a \\nhormogonium. \\nAkinete formation: The initial step is the cell enlargement which is the first step \\ntowards differentiation of vegetative cell into akinete.

The individual fibrils that compose the axial filament \\noriginate near the ends of the cell and are normally more than half the length of the cell. \\nSpirochetes have a typical gram-negative cell wall and a well developed periplasmic space \\nthat encloses the flagella called endoflagella (axial filament). Endoflagella are constrained \\nsomewhat like limbs in a sleeping bag, their flexing propels the cell by rotation and even \\ncrawling motions. \\nThe fibrils of the axial filament have a fine structure essentially the same as that \\nof flagella; a basal body containing a series of disks; a hook; and the filament itself. The \\nnumber of disks varies among the spirochetes: Leptospira typically has two pairs of disks, \\nwhereas most other spirochetes have a single pair of disks. The filaments are often \\nenveloped in a proteinaceous sheath unlike the eubacterial flagellum which, if sheathed, \\nis surrounded by an extension of the outer membrane.

Among the latter are twisting, lashing and writhing movements \\nthat are characteristic of the group. Since these movements are very rapid and since the \\ncells are often so thin as to be at the edge of detection with the light microscope, they \\nlook as if they were instantaneously moving from one position to another. On surfaces, \\nspirochetes can glide, a motility often termed creeping rather than gliding. They also \\nexhibit an 'inchworm' kind of motility, in which one end of the cell attaches to the surface, \\nand the other end attaches nearby: the first end then detaches and reattaches at a distance. \\nRepitition of these steps results in relatively rapid movement. \\nThe axial filament has long been suspected to playa role in motility, suspicion that \\nwas strengthened when the structural resemblance between their constituent fibers and \\nbacterial flagella was recognized. The isolation of immotile mutants with altered axial \\nfibrils confirms the role of endoflegella in motility. \\nNevertheless, it is still unclear how motion is actually effected. Because of the \\nstructural homology between flagella and endoflagella, it is tempting to propose that they \\nshere a similar mechanism, namely rotation from the base of the filament. How endoflagellar \\nrotation would result in cell movement is controversial. However it is clearly not due to \\nrotation of the cell as a whole; rather a helical wave is propagated down the cell. Two \\nfundamental mechanisms are envisaged-rotation of flexible endoflagella may cause the \\nrigid helical murein-bound protoplast to rotate within the outer membrane or rotation of \\nthe rigid helical endoflagella may cause the liable cell body to flex in the form of a helical \\nwave. \\nS.No. \\n1. \\n2. \\n3. \\n4. \\n5. \\nFig. 2 : Movement in spirochete \\nTABLE 1 \\nCharacteristic Features of Spirochetes in Pure Culture \\nCharacters Trepollema Borrelia Leptospira \\nCell diameter 0.1-0.4 llm 0.2-0.5 llm 0.1 llm \\nRelationship to 02 Anaerobe Microaerophile Aerobe \\nEnergy metabolism Fermentative Fermentative Respiratory \\nPercent G + C 22-54 Unknown 35-52 \\nCarbon and energy Sugars or Sugars Fatty acid \\nsource Amino acids or fatty alcohols \\nContd ...\"),\n",

Human infection occurs when bacteria released from \\ncrushed lice gain entry to tissues through damaged or intact skin or mucous membranes. \\nTransovarial transmission to the tick progeny maintains the spirochete in the tick \\npopulation. \\nIn both forms of relapSing fever, acute symptoms, including high fever, rigors, \\nheadache, myalgia, arthralgia, photophobia and cough, develop about one week after \\ninfection. A skin rash may occur and there is central nervous system involvement in up \\nto 30% of cases. During the acute phase there may be up to 105 spirochetes per cubic \\nmillimeter of blood.

Ticks that acquire the infection \\nremain infective for a life time. \\nThe genus Rickettsia is currently divided into two antigenically distinct group and \\nthe spotted fever group, which are very closely related. They have a typical gram-negative \\nbacterial cell wall, including a bilayered outer membrane that contain the lipopolysaccharide \\nantigens that distinguish the two groups. External to the outer membrane there appears \\nto be a slime layer, probably composed of polysaccharides. Electrophoresis has demonstrated \\na number of distinct and common proteins in both groups of rickettsiae. The \\nimmunodominant rickettsial outer membrane proteins A (Omp A)· has been studied \\nprincipally in the spotted fever group rickettsiae. It contains a hydrophilic region of tandem \\nrepeat units that determine the diversity of molecular size and antigens largely by the \\nnumber, order and type of repeat units. Omp B is a typical autotransporter protein and \\nis abundant in both groups of rickettsiae. Omp A and Omp B both contain cross reactive \\nand species-specific epitopes. \\nPathogenesis \\nRickettsiae normally enter the body through the bite and dust from hides or pelts \\nof infected animals may contain large numbers of highly infectious spores from dried fecal \\nmaterial of arthropod parasites such as ticks. They are disseminated through the blood \\nstream, enter endothelial cells by induced phagocytosis, escape from the phagosome, \\nmultiply intracellularly and eventually destroy their host cells. Observations in cell culture \\nsystems suggest that spotted fever and typhus group rickettsiae destroy the host cell by \\ndifferent mechanism. \\nA common target in rickettsial infections is the endothelial lining of the small blood \\nvessels. The bacteria recognize, enter and multiply within endothelial cells, causing \\nnecrosis of the vascular living. Among the immediate pathological consequences are \\nvasculities, perivascular infiltration by inflammatory cells, vascular leakage and \\nthrombosis. These pathologic effects are manifested by skin rash, edema, hypotension \\nand gangrene. \\nIntravascular clotting in the brain accounts for the stuporous mental changes and \\nother neurological symptoms that sometimes occur. \\nSpecific Rickettsioses \\nRickettsioses can be differentiated on the basis of their clinical features and \\nepidemiology as: \\n1.

This pigment absorbs wave lengths of light that \\npenetrate to greater depths and are not used by other photosynthetic organisms. By \\nproducing elemental sulphur as a by-product of their photosynthesis, anoxygenic \\nphototrophic bacteria probably caused the huge deposits of elemental sulphur that occur \\nin various parts of the world. Certain lakes in North Africa are now to be in the process \\nof forming new sulphur deposits. They contain large populations of anoxygenic phototrophs, \\nand their bottoms are covered with elemental sulphur. \\nThese bacteria are deeply coloured-red, orange, purple and bright green, because \\nof the chlorophyll and accessory photosynthetic pigments they contain. Water samples \\nfrom deep regions of lakes with an abundance of these organisms are also intensely \\ncolored. \\nPhysiologically, these bacteria carry out photosynthesis anaerobically.

In many respects they resemble fungi, and for \\nthat reason they are known as ray fungi. Their filamentous nature, branching pattern, \\nand conidia formation are similar to those of fungi. Their size and spore characters are \\nsimilar to bacteria. Recent detailed studies have brought out clearly that actinomycetes \\nare quite distinct from the fungi and bacteria in many respects. Their natural occurrence \\nis mostly restricted to soils. They are gram + ve and are related to the coryneform bacteria \\nand mycobacteria by an almost conteneous sequence of intermediate form. The actinomycete \\ncolonies are characteristic in several respects. They produce mass of growth to form a \\ncolony, but an actinomycete colony differs from the bacterial colony in that it consist of \\na mass of filamentous threads with spore-bearing hyphae. They consist of vegetative and \\nsporogenous hyphae. The vegetative mycelium is lichinoid and exists below the surface \\nof the agar medium. The colour of the vegetative mycelium may vary, and it may also \\nproduce soluble pigments in the medium. \\nThe aerial mycelium emerges from the vegetative hyphae in the medium. The type \\nof aerial mycelium varies with the genus and species of the actinomycetes. The chief \\ncharacteristics of spore-bearing hyphae are illustrated. The sporogenous hyphae vary in \\nlength and may be formed in chains, whorls, tufts, or in spring. The method of branching \\nof the hyphae also is characteristic of the species, and serves as a basis for speciation \\nof Streptomyces. Actinomycetes produce true conidia or chlamydospores.

On germination of the spores, formation of one or two germ tubes has been \\nreported. From the germ tubes primary hyphae are formed, which give rise to a network \\nof thin mycelium. In the substrate the mycelium is thin, vegetative, and of varying colour. \\nThe growth of actinomycetes on solid or liquid medium results in characteristic colonies \\nor masses.

This polymorphism has c~used considerable \\nconfusion in the taxonomic literature. In some cases they multiply by budding to produce \\ncolonies similar to those of micrococci. The concentration and segmentation of the \\nprotoplasm in the filaments is commonly observed. In some older cultures, chlamydospores \\nare also seen. Some nocardias exhibit motility at certain stages of their growth. When \\nstained, young nocardias show undifferentiated protoplasm. The conidia are produced \\nsingly at the end of simple or branched conidiophores. Sporangiospores are borne inside \\nthe hyphal strands, and they are usually spherical in shape. The cell wall substance is \\nneither chitin nor cellulose and it is not resistant to desiccation unlike in streptomycetes. \\nActinomyces spp. are pathogenic in many instances, and are anaerobic or \\nmicroaerophilic. They branch in a characteristic angular manner. Their colonies are tough \\nand sometimes diptheroid. \\nStreptomycetes are mostly aerobic and soil-dwellers, except for a few plant pathogenic \\nspecies. Many streptomycetes degrade cellulose, chitin and other recalcitrant natural \\nsubstances. The vegetative mycelium usually does not fragment into bacillary or coccoid \\ncells whereas conidia are borne in sporophores. Typical aerial mycelium is much \\nbranched, and the conidia are formed in chains. The conidia formation patterns broadly \\ndivided into five groups, viz. (a) straight sporulating hyphae. (b) spore-bearing hyphae \\narranged in clusters, (c) spiral formation in aerial mycelium with long and open spirals \\n(d) spiral formation of the aerial mycelium, short and compact, and (e) spore-bearing \\nhyphae arranged on the mycelium in whorls or tufts. In some cases the capacity to produce \\nconidia and aerial mycelium may be lost due to continued culturing in artificial media. \\nMicromollospora spp. are non-septate and thin. They do not form aerial mycelium \\nbut spread well inside the agar medium. The substrate hyphae are branched with cross\\xad\\nwalls and the aerial mycelium is either not formed or rudimentary. They multiply by \\nconidia formation, either singly at the end of special condiophores, which may be \\nbranched, or in clusters. \\nThe genus Waksmmlia (Microbisporn) is characterized by the formation of spores in \\npairs on aerial conidiophores. The mycelium may be substrate or aerial, and the aerial \\nmyceliunl bears spores which are formed in longitudinal pairs. There are four genera \\nwhich comprise the thermophilic group of actinomycetes. They are: (i) Tl1ermomonospora \\nwhich has long aerial hyphae, forming spores singly on simple or branched sporophores; \\n(ii) Tlzenllopolyspora which has long hyphae with spores produced in pairs or long chains; \\n(iii) TIler11loactinolllyces which has spores singly or in chains, originating directly from the \\nsubstrate mycelium.

Some species of \\nStreptomyces are also thermophilic and are grouped among the above four genera. Two \\nother genera of actinomycetes which are less commonly known are: (1) Actilloplmles which \\nhave no aerial mycelium, but produce motile sporangiospores inside sporangial bodies, \\nand (2) Streptospormlgiu11I which has aerial mycelium with coiled sporangiophores and'),\n",

The division is also bacteria-like in most cases. \\nThe cell wall is also gram-positive and some are acid-fast, and the wall is composed of \\nmucopolysaccharides, together with 2 percent lipid, whereas fungi contain chitin, cellulose \\nand lignin. Thus, cytologically actinomycetes resemble bacteria. \\nThe carbon content (45%) of the actinomycetes cell is not much different from that \\nof fungi and bacteria. Actinomycetes have a nitrogen content of 10%, which is more than \\nthat of fungi, and are closer to bacteria. The amino acid content of actinomycetes and \\nbacteria is almost similar. The work on the mycobacteria has shown that 63% of lipid \\nis present in the cell. In other actinomycetes, the aerial mycelium contains more lipid than \\nthe primary or vegetative mycelium. Streptomyces griseus contains 14% lipid, as against \\n4.4 % in Bacillus subtilis. Cellulose and chitin are absent in Streptomyces. \\nWhen treated with 30% KOH, the cell wall of actinomycetes disappears. If cellulose \\nand chitin are present, they are not soluble in 30% KOH. Lysozyme, which is specific \\nfor mucopolysaccharides, can lyse the cell wall of actinomycetes. Besides, hexosamine \\nhas been detected in the cell wall of Streptomyces spp. S. fradiae and S. griseus contain \\n18.48 % and 19.9% hexosamine, respectively, as against 2 to 3 % in Nocardia spp. There \\nis most of hexose in Nocardia than in Streptomyces. The protein contents of Streptomyces \\nand Nocardia have been studied and found to be similar. Arginine, lysine, hexosamine, \\nalanine, valine, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, glutamic acid, diaminopimelic \\nacid, asparagines, etc are the common amino acids found in these proteins. \\nThe dry powdery appearance of the aerial mycelium of actinomycetes, and the \\ndifficulty of wetting the spores appears to be due to the presence of lipids in their cell \\nwalls. In 1954 O.T. Avery and F. Blank reported that representative species of Actinomyces, \\nNocardia, Streptomyces and Micromollospora were all devoid of chitin and cellulose, and \\nthis is indicative of their closer relationship to bacteria than to fungi. Though several \\nscientists attempted to demonstrate the presence of nucleus in actinomycete cells, the first \\nconvincing account came from L. Grigorakis who in 1931 found that in the thallus of \\nActinomyces bovis, the nuclei divided amitotically, whereas in the aerial spores nucleus \\ncould not be demonstrated.

The eukaryotic cell is a complex compartmentalized unit that differ from the \\nprokaryotic cell in containing a definite nucleus and several other specialized structures \\nlike cell organelles.

A multicellular organism is more than just an assemblage of cell like a colony \\nbut it is composed of distinct groups of cells that can't exist independently of rest of the \\nbody. The cell grouping of multicellular organism that have a specific function are termed \\ntissues, and groups of tissues make up organs. \\nAll protozoa, algae, fungi live a unicellular or colonial existence. Truly multicellular \\norganism are found only among plants and animals and some of the fungi and algae. \\nOnly certain eukaryotes are small enough to fall into the realm of microbiology, the \\nprotozoa, fungi and algae. The fungi, algae, and protozoa are the eukaryotic microorganism \\nevolved along three distinct lines of nutrient, cellular and energy acquisition. The fungi \\nabsorb nutrients from host or are parasitic or saprophytic. The algae carry out \\nphotosynthesis to form cellular ATP. Protozoa acquire nutrients and energy through \\ningestion of organic compounds often using phagocytosis to bring nutrients into the cell. \\nFungi typically form filamentous mycelia but one group the yeast are characteristically \\nunicellular. The fungi are classified largely on the basis of their modes of reproduction. \\nThe sexual spores of fungi are the most important features used in classification and \\nidentification of fungi. \\nThe algae are classified largely on the basis of pigment production and biochemical \\nnature of reserve food material. \\nThe protozoa are classified largely on their modes of locomotion. \\nNext following headings contain a generalized survey of principal eukaryotic micro \\norganism viz. - algae, fungi, slime molds, protozoa etc. \\nALGAE \\nAlgae comprise a group of chlorophyll containing thalloid plants of the simplest \\ntype, having no true roots, stems, leaves or leaf like organs. They are placed in the division \\nThallophyta along with fungi. They differ from fungi in the presence of chlorophyll \\n(photosynthetic pigment) and in their mode of nutrition. Although most of the algae are \\nautotrophic, i.e. they synthesize their food by themselves, yet heterotrophic and holozoic \\nforms are not uncommon. The term algae is used even if the plant is a unicellular. The \\nthallus is non-vascular and thus has no elements for the transport of fluids. The algae \\ncan afford this simplicity because with only a few exceptions they are water dwellers. \\nThey have non jacketed, either unicellular sexorgans or multicellular in which every cell \\nproduce a gamete. Most of them are among the simplest in the plant kingdom. \\nGeneral Characters \\n1. Mostly aquatic (marine & fresh) \\nDiverse habitats-below the soil level, moist rocks, wet logs, snow etc. \\n2.

The mitotic figures are also lacking. The chlorophyll pigment is bound to photosynthetic \\nlamellae or thylakoids which may be arranged in parallel layers in the periphery of the \\ncytoplasm or form a network extending throughout the cell cytoplasm. They are not \\norganized into grana. The chloroplasts are thus absent and so are the mitochondria, golgi \\nbody and endoplasmic reticulum. The ribosomes are, however, present. The nuclear \\ndivision does not take place by mitosis and no cell plate is formed instead there is a ring \\nlike extension of the cell wall. It extends in wards like a diaphragm with decreasing \\naperture and divides the cell into daughter cells. Such simple cells of blue-green algae \\n(and bacteria) which lack a nuclear membrane, mitochondria, plastids and do not divide \\nby mitosis are called prokaryotic. The cells constituting the thalli of all other algae \\nexcepting the blue green are called eukaryotic. The eukaryotic cell has the same structure \\nas is typical of the higher plants. \\nALGAL FLAGELLA \\nThe motile cells of algae are provided with fine, protoplasmic, whiplike threads, \\nthe flagella. They are extremely fine and hyaline emergencies of the cytoplasm. In cells \\npossessing firm cell walls, the flagella are connected with the inner cytoplasm through \\nsmall pores in the cell wall. There is either a single anterior flagellum (rarely posterior) \\nor the flagella occur in pairs, rarely in great numbers on the cell. The . flagella on the cell \\nmay be equal (isokont) or unequal (heterokont) in length. When the flagella are inserted \\nlaterally one is directed forwards in motion and the other backwards. They function as \\nthe locomotory or propelling structures of the cell. Usually there is a single granule at \\nthe base of each flagellum. It is known as the blepharoplast. \\n(a) Structure of the Flagellum: Forming the Lore of the flagellum is an axial or central \\nfilament called the axoneme. The latter is surrounded by a cytoplasmic membrane or \\nsheath which terminates short of the apex. The naked, terminal portion of the axoneme \\nis called the end piece. The tip of the end piece may be blunt and rounded or pointed. \\nIn cross section the flagellum consists of two inner central simple fibrils forming an elastic \\naxial thread. It is surrounded by nine united, peripheral contractile, thicker protein double \\nfibrils. All are enclosed by sheath which is an extension of the plasma membrane. Each \\nperipheral fibril is composed of two thin fibrils. The two central fibrils are single. They \\nlie side by side and are sometimes enclosed by a sheath of their own. The fibrils are hollow \\nand extend along the entire length of the flagellum. The nine peripheral fibrils join the \\nbasal granule but the two central fibrils stop short of the granule. This '9 + 2' pattern \\nof component fibrils is the basic structures of the flagellum of all organisms except the \\nbacteria. \\n(b) Kinds of Flagella: They are of two main types, whiplash and tinsel. The whiplash \\nflagellum has a smooth surface. The tinsel flagellum bears longitudinal rows of fine, \\nminute flimmer hairs arranged along the axis almost to the tip of the flagellum. There \\nmay be a single row of hairs as in the Euglenophyta and Pyrrophyta or two as in \\nChrysophyceae and Phaeophyceae. The hairs arise from the margins of the peripheral \\nfibrils. The whiplash or smooth flagella are also known by other names such as acronematic \\nor peitchgeisel. The other names for the tinsel flagella are pantollematic flimmer or flimmergeisel.\"),\n",

[when \\ngametes fuse to form zygote] on the basis of organs and their complexity, the following \\nsix types of sexual reproduction are recognized in different groups of algae: \\nI. Autogamy: When two gametes of the same mOL'ler cell fuse to form a diploid \\nnucleus, it is called autogamy. In this process there is only fusion of two gametic nuclei \\n(Karyogamy). The autogamy lacks incorporation of external genes (do not show new \\ncharacters) eg - Diatoms \\nII. Hologamy: The vegetative cells of different strains (+) and (-) (female & male) \\nbehave as gametes and fuse to form zygote. More advance- it involves fusion of two cells \\nhaving different genetic constitution ego Unicellular forms (Chlamydomonas) \\nIII. Isogamy: The two gametes which fuse to form zygote, are morphologically and \\nphysiolOgically similar (isogametes). They are usually motile and flagellated. eg- Ulotlzrix, \\nChlamydomonas. \\nIV. Physiological anisogamy: Gametes are similar in morphological characters, they \\nshow physiological variation with (+) and (-) strains. eg - SpirogtJra, Zygnema, Ectocarpus. \\nV. Anisogamy: Gametes are morphologically and physiologically distinct. The male \\nor (microgametes) are smaller and more active, whereas female or macro gametes are larger. \\neg- Chlamydomonas. \\nVI. Oogamy: Advanced type of sexual reproduction. Large non motile egg or ovum \\nfuses with a small motile sperm or antherozoid (in Rhodophyceae, sperm are non motile). \\nEgg is formed with in the oogonium and sperms with in the antheridium. eg- Volvox, \\nOedogolliul1l, Chara, Vallcheria, Sargassllm, Polysiphollia. \\nTYPES OF LIFE CYCLE \\nThe sequence of orderly changes in growth and development of an algae is said \\nto be life cycle. During the process of sexual reproduction gametes fertilize resulting into \\na diploid zygote, this undergoes reduction division and forms haploid plants or it directly \\nforms a diploid plant. A generation is considered as a somatic phase. The alteration of \\ngeneration means a situation in which a plant depicts two somatic phases which regularly \\nalternate during the life cycle i.e. haploid (gametophytic) and diploid (sporophytic). \\n(I) Haplontic Type: Plant is haploid and bears haploid gametes in the gametangium. \\nThe gametic fusion results in the formation of a diploid zygote which is the only diploid \\nphase in the life cycle. The zygote nucleus divides meiotically to produce four meiospores, \\neach of these develops into a new individual. Thus, there is an alternation of a haploid \\nplant with a diploid zygote. eg- Chlamydomollas (unicellular), Ulothrix, Oedogonium, \\nSpirogyra, Zygllema and Chara. \\n(II) Diplontic Type: Diploid plant bears sex organ (gametangia) which are also \\ndiploid. The reduction division takes place at the time of the formation of gametes and \\nas such the gametes are haploid. After gametic fusion diploid stage is re-established in \\nthe form of zygote. The zygote does not undergo any reduction divisipn and it gives rise \\nto a diploid plant body. Thus, there is an alteration of a diploid plant with haploid \\ngametes.eg: Cladophora, SargasS1l11l and Diatoms\"),\n",

Like insects and \\norchids, fungi are quite possibly speciating rapidly than they are being discovered. \\nThe Vegetative body: The vegetative body is a thallus. It consists of filaments about \\n5 ~m in diameter which are multiply branched and spread over or into the nutrient \\nmedium. The filaments or hyphae consist of a cell wall and cytoplasm with its inclusions. \\nThe hyphae may be without cross walls (in the lower fungi) or divided into cells by septa \\nin the higher fungi. However, even in the septate hyphae, the cytoplasm of the cells is \\ncontinuous via a central pore in the septum. The total of the hyphal mass of a fungal \\nthallus is called the mycelium. In certain stages, often during transition to the sexual or \\nasexual reproduction phase, the mycelium forms tissue like aggreagates, the so-called \\nplectenchyma. A typical plectenchyma is the 'flesh' of the mushroom. In the higher fungi, \\nthe mycelium may also form thick strands, rhizomorphs, which function to transport \\nnutrients. \\nNutrition \\nA universal characteristic of fungi is that they are completely heterotrophic; no trace \\nof photosynthesis is found in any stage of any group. However, because they have walls, \\nfungi cannot engulf food as animals do; instead, fungi must obtain nutrients from the \\nenvironment from living, dying or dead organisms. On this basis, fungi are subdivided \\ninto three types: (1) biotrophs (parasites), which draw nutrients slowly from living hosts,\"),\n",

(3) saprotrophs, fungi that attack \\norganisms after they have died from other causes. \\nMany biotrophs secrete chemicals that cause the host cell membrane to become \\nunusually permeable to sugars or amino acids, as they leak from the host cell, the fungus \\nabsorbs them. In sophisticated parasites, damage to the host cell is so slight that the plant \\nresponds as though the fungus were a normal sink for metabolities, and extra sugars and \\namino acids are actually trai1sported by the plant from other leaves to the site of infection, \\njust as though the fungus were a developing fruit or other plant part. In biotrophic attacks, \\nfungal cells may remain confined solely to intercellular spaces; in other species; the fungus \\ncreates a small hole in the plant cell wall, then inserts a small portion, the haustorium, \\nof its filamentous cell through the hole. The haustorium is in close contact with the plant \\ncell plasma membrane, which probably makes it easier to absorb nutrients. \\nExtracellular Digestion: Natural release of sugars may be sufficient for the fungi, \\nbut typically they secrete digestive enzymes that attack host polymers, converting them \\nto sugars, amino acids, and lipids tllat can be absorbed. Saprotrophs depend predominantly \\non this form of extracellular digestion, and many depolymerize and consume cellulose \\n(brown rot fungi), hemicelluloses, and even lignin (white rot fungi). The ability either to \\nabsorb host-produced monomers or to secrete extracellular digestive enzymes is often both \\nspecies specific and tissue specific. Many biotrophic and saprotrophic fungi can attack \\nsuccessfully only a few or just one host species, or even just a single variety of one plant \\nspecies. Many fungi are even tissue specific: Wilt-inducing fusariums must invade xylem \\nand attack xylary middle lamellas; they cannot survive in cortex, pith, or phloem even \\nthough those cells are rich in free monomers. Fungi transmitted by aphids and other \\nphloem-sucking insects usually are able to attack only phloem: their toxins and extracellular \\nenzymes are not effective against other tissues. \\nGrowth and reproduction: Fungal hyphae elongate at their apices (apical growth). \\nIn most fungi every part of the mycelium has the potential for growth (elongation); a small \\npiece of mycelium is sufficient for inoculation to produce a new thallus. However, the \\nforms and mechanisms involved in the reproduction of fungi are extremely diverse and \\nare used as the basis for classification. Two kinds of reproduction are distinguished, \\nnamely sexual and asexual. Most fungi can reproduce in both ways. A universal character \\nof fungi is their formation of spores, resistant resting stages that are the primarily means \\nof reproduction, dispersal and survival, spores are produced either asexually or sexually. \\nAsexual reproduction of fungi is mostly by budding, fragmentation, or formation \\nof spores. Spore formation is the most widely distributed and most highly differentiated \\nmethod. Conidiospores are budded off at hyphal apices (in Penicillillm, Aspergilllls). When \\nthese arise inside sporangia (i.e. receptacles), the fungi are grouped as sporangiospores \\n(Mucor, Rhizopus). In the lower fungi, sporangia are often motile by means of flagella and \\nare called zoospores. The flagella conform to the typical eukaryotic model: they originate \\nfrom a blepharoplast in the cytoplasm and consist of eleven parallel fibrils of which nine \\nperipheral fibrils are arranged concentrically around two central ones (9 +2). \\nThe asexual reproduction characteristic of yeasts (budding fungi) is budding; the'),\n",

In different fungi, the nuclear fusion may occur at different \\nintervals after the first parental contact. Sexual reproduction can usually be divided into \\nthree phases. \\nPlasmogamy, the fusion of two protoplasts. The resulting cell has two nuclei. This \\nnuclear pair or dikaryon does not need to fuse immediately, but it can persist in the \\ndikaryotic state during the rest of the cell division, the two nuclei dividing simultaneously \\n(conjugative division). The fusion of the two haploid nuclei (karyogamy) may occur later, \\noften only after formation of a fruiting body, to give the diploid nucleus of the zygote. \\nFollowing karyogamy, meiosis, the reduction division of the chromosomes to the haploid \\nnumber, takes place. These three processes or stages, plasmogamy, karyogamy, and \\nmeiosis, may occur in immediate sequence in some fungi, but in others they can occur \\nduring quite different stages of development. \\nIn the lower fungi the phase of sexual reproduction is initiated by the formation \\nof gametes, i.e. sexual cells. When the gametes formed by the male and female parental \\ncells are ipdistinguishable morphologically they are called isogametes. The gametes are \\noften formed inside morphologically differentiated cells, which are called gametangia, and \\nwhen these are morphologically distinct, the male gametangia are called antheridia and \\nthe female ones are called oogonia. \\nThe ways in which the gametes are transferred and plasmogamy achieved can again \\nbe sub divided into various kinds. In lower fungi, especially in aquatic ones, both gametes \\nare usually motile (planogametes) and fuse outside the gametangia (i.e. after liberation \\nfrom the gametangia). In the oomycetes only the male gamete is motile; it penetrates the \\noogonium and fertilizes the ovum. Zygomycetes are characterized by gametangiogamy, \\nthe fusion of whole, multinucleate gametangia into a coenozygote. \\nWhen the male and female gametangia originate from the same vegetative body \\n(produced from a single spore), the organism is referred to as a homothallic or hermaphrodite \\nfungus (monozoic). In heterothallic, or dizoic, fungi the thalli are either male or female, \\nthat is, they bear only male or female sex organs. Homothallic fungi can be self-fertilising \\n(autogamous). However, in some homothallic fungi no self-fertilisation occurs due to some \\nphysiological inhibitory mechanism, which is referred to as incompatibility. This is the \\ncase in Neurospora, for example, which, though homothallic, needs conjugation between \\nmembers of different types (+ and - ) to establish fertilization, individuals belonging to \\nthe same type are incompatible. \\nClassification \\nThe classification of fungi, like that of bacteria, is designed mainly for practical \\napplication but it also bears some relation to phylogenetic considerations. The nomenclature \\nis binomial, with a generic and a specific name (eg: Aspergillus lliger). Species are collected \\nin genera, genera in families (suffix -aceae), families in orders (suffix-ales), and orders'),\n",

Such consumption of particulate matter is not possible in true fungi because of \\ntheir rigid cell walls. \\nThe slime molds are of two types, acellular and cellular. The somatic phase in the \\nformer is called the plasmodium. It is a free living, multinucleate, apparently naked \\nprotoplasmic mass. It is holocarpic. The somatic phase in the cellular slime molds is termed \\nthe pseudoplasmodium. \\nIn response to environmental cues, a plasmodium aggregates its protoplasm, forming \\none or several mounds; it then extends upward, producing sporangia on stalks. Spores \\nwith true walls are formed and released; the spores are extremely resistant, surviving for \\nmany years even under adverse conditions. Meiosis occurs after the spores form; then \\nthree nuclei degenerate. Upon germination, the spores may release either an amoeboid \\nor a flagellated cell, and the two forms are interconvertible. The cell grows and may \\nundergo both nuclear and cellular division proliferating into a population of haploid cells. \\nEach cell contains mating type factors, and when two compatible cells meet, they fuse \\ninto one mass, mixing the two types of nuclei. Fusion is not limited to two cells; many \\ncells may fuse, resulting in a multi-nucleate plasmodium. Karyogamy occurs shortly \\nthereafter, and nuclei are then diploid. The plasmodium continues to migrate and feed \\nuntil induced to undergo another round of spore formation. \\nThe phylogenetic-evolutionary - relationships of slime molds to other organisms \\nare not known.

Alexopoulos (1960) by described three types namely \\nprotoplasmodium, aphanoplamodium and phaneroplasmodium. \\n1. Protoplasmodium: The plasmodium in some myxomycetes (order Echinosteliales) \\nis simple and of a primitive type. It is a uninucleate tiny mass of nearly homogenous \\nslimy protoplasm which form pseudopode but shows no distinction into veins. It is the \\nsmallest among the myxomycetes and remains microscopic as long as it exists. The \\ncytoplasmic stream is indistinct, slow and irregular. At the fruiting time it gets converted \\ninto a single sporangium. \\n2. Aphanoplasmodium: This type of plasmodium is characteristic of the order \\nstemonitomycetales. Early in its development the aphanoplasmodium looks very much \\nlike a protoplasmodium. During further growth it elongates and branches, finally resulting \\nin a network of delicate strands. The aphanoplasmodium lacks the slimy sheath. The \\nplasmodial protoplasm is less granular and tl1US transparent and not easily visible. The \\ndistinction into ectoplasm and endoplasm in not conspicuous. The cytoplasmic streaming \\nis, however, rapid and confined by a fine membrane. \\n3. Phaneroplasmodium: It is the most common type and characteristic of the order \\nphysarales. The mature phaneroplasmodium is a massive structure. In its initial stages \\nof development it is very much like the proloplasmodium. The multinucleate slimy \\nprotoplasm of the phaneroplasmodium is highly granular. It is differentiated into \\nectoplasm and endoplasm. At maturity it is divisible into an anterior fan-shaped perforated \\nsheet of protoplasm and posterior zone consisting of a reticulate network of tubular veins \\nor strands in which flows the rapid endoplasmic stream. \\nSclerotium formation: Under conditions of stress and strain, the phaneroplasmodium \\nbecomes converted into an irregular hardened mass of thick-walled cellular units. It is \\ntermed the sclerotium. \\nThe polynucleate thick-walled units constituting the sclerotium are termed spherules. \\nThe sclerotia and spherules remain dormant under conditions unfavourable for vegetative \\ngrowth. With the return of conditions suitable for growth, the sclerodium germinates to \\ngive rise to a new plasmodium. \\nReproductive phase: Normally on reaching a certain stage of maturity, the \\nMyxomycete plasmodium passes into the reproductive stage. During this stage the entire \\nplasmodium becomes converted into one or more fruit-like bodies, the sporophores or \\nsphororigia which bear the spores. This process is termed sporulation. The latter bear \\nspores within sporophores. The sporophores in the endosporus Myxomycetes chiefly are \\nof three types namely sporangia, aethalia and plasmodiocarps. \\nSporangia: Most of the endosporous Myxomycetes (order physarales) produce fruit \\nbodies of this type. At the fruiting time the planeroplasmodium becomes converted into \\na group of several stalked, sometimes sessile sac-like structures, the sporangia. The \\nsporangia in the group remain separate from one another. However, they arise in close \\nproximity from a common thin transparent cellophane like base called the hypothallus.'),\n",

Babesia, Leishmania and Plasmodium are the smallest protozoans known so far. Some \\nof the larger protozoa, like Amoeba and Paramedum, can be seen with naked eyes, \\n. Spirostomum, a ciliate, grows to 3 mm long. Pelomyxa, a giant amoeba, attains a diameter \\nof about 1 to 5 mm. Porospora gigantea, a sporozoa, grows to about 16 mm long. Cycloclypeus, \\na foraminifera, exceeds a diameter of about 50 mm and some shelled marine protozoans \\nhave diameters of about 63 mm. \\nShape \\nProtozoa, the most primitive of all organisms, exhibit nearly all types of body shape. \\nThe body shape of a protozoa is definite but it may usually vary within narrow limits. \\nThe body shape is usually determined by the consistency of cytoplasm, limiting membranes \\nof the body, shells & skeleton. Amoeba has an irregular, asymmetrical body shape because \\nof the absence of rigid body envelope. However, the floating forms usually possess \\nspherical body shape like Noctiluca; the body shape is usually elongated in active \\nswimmers like Euglena and Paramedum, the body shape may be flattened in creeping forms \\nlike OXljtricha. Shells and tests like those of Difflugia and Arcella determine the shape of \\nthese species. It may be funnel-shaped like stentor, bell-shaped like Vorticella and so on. \\nSome of the protozoans like Radiolarians exhibit spherical symmetry and attached species \\nlike Vorticella exhibit more or less radial symmetry. \\nBody Envelope & Skeleton \\nThese protect them from external environmental hazards. The body envelope, being \\nselective in nature, allows exchange of substances across it and helps in perceiving various \\ntypes of stimuli. However, the body envelope, in protozoans, may be either plasmalemma \\nor pellicle. In some species like Amoeba proteus, the body envelope is a thin plasma \\nmembrane or plasmalemma which is mucopolysaccharide in nature. It helps in adhesion \\nto the substratum and in the exchange of various materials. The pellicle is comparatively \\nthicker, tough, elastic and porteinous in nature, it helps in maintaining the general shape \\nof the protozoans and performs the usual functions. \\nThe skeletal layers are secreted in still other protozoans in which their protoplasmic \\nbody remains protected. These include (a) cyst, (b) theca, (c) lorica and (d) test or shell. \\nIt is primarily secreted during unfavourable conditions. The encysted individuals \\ncomfortably tide over the environmental hazards. The theca is another skeletal layer found \\nin many dinoflagellates like Ceratium & Glenodinium. It is a coat of closely-fitted armour \\nof cellulose, comparable to the thick cell walls of higher plants. The lorica, in majority \\nof dinoflagellates, in differentiated into a number of plates arranged into a definite pattern; \\nbut in some forms, it may be formed of two valves. The lorica is still another skeletal \\nlayer found in certain protozoans like Salpingoeca, Monosiga, Dinobnjon, Synura splendida \\nand Poteriodendron, etc. It is a coat of less-closely fitted armour of protozoans than the \\ntheca. The lorica is usually vase-shaped or tubular having an opening for the emergence \\nof the anterior part of the animal or its appendages. The base of the lorica is either attached \\ndirectly to the substratum (in sessile individuals .like Salipingoeca) or it may terminate in'),\n",

The cytoplasm \\nis commonly divided into peripheral clear ectoplasm and inner granular endoplasm. These \\ntwo may change from one to the other as is reported in Amoeba proteus. The cytoplasm \\ncontains various organelles like mitochondria, golgi bodies, endoplasmic reticulum, \\nribosomes, lysosomes, centrioles, microtubules, plastids, etc. \\nNucleus \\nThe nuclei of Protozoa exhibit a greater variety of size, shape and structure than \\nthe nuclei of Metazoa. The nucleus of Protozoa has a nuclear membrane, nUcleoplasm, \\noxychromatin, basichromatin, and there may be a nucleolus. The nuclear membrane \\nremains intact even in cell division. There are various kinds of nuclei in protozoa 1. \\nVesicular nucleus has a large amount of nuceloplasm, the chromatin is small in quantity \\nand it forms small granules, the achromatin (oxychromatin) is more fluid and its network, \\nif present, is coarse, there is a round endosome of basichromatin or oxychromatin, or of \\nboth e.g, Euglena, Arcella, Entamoeba 2. Massive or computer nucleus has a small amount \\nof nucleoplasm, there is a large amount of chromatin forming evenly scattered small \\ngranules, the achromatin is viscid forming a fine network, eg., Amoeba. In the majority \\nof protozoa the nuclei show a structure intermediate between the vesicular and massive \\nnuclei. 3 polyenergid nucleus has several sets of chromosomes, instead of one set inside \\nthe nuclear membrane, this is due to mitosis occurring repeatedly 'inside the nuclear \\nmembrane. But the sets of chromosomes are finally liberated and each forms a new nucleus. \\nThe polyenergid condition is a provision for spore formation, eg., Radiolaria. \\nLocomotion \\nThe Protozoa perform locomotion or movement by various organelles; pseudopodia \\ncharacteristic of Sarcodina, flagella characteristic of flagellate (Mastigophora), cilia \\ncharacteristics of Ciliata and other contractile structures of pellicle, myonemes, characteristic \\nof Sporozoa and few others. The seat of locomotion lies in the ectoplasm, since locomotor \\norganelles either arise from it or are present in it. \\n(A) Pseudopodia: Pseudopodia are generally temporary out growths of protoplasm \\nfrom any part of the body, they are found in those protozoa which are 'naked' or have \\na very thin pellicle. Pseudopodia may be of ectoplasm or they may also have a core of \\nendoplasm.

All 20 fibrils lie in a matrix of dense cytoplasm and \\nthey fuse at the base to join a basal granule or kinetosome. The kinetosome may be joined \\nto the nucleus by a rhizoplast. The basal granule is often synonymous with a centriole \\nbecause it initiates nuclear divisions, if it does not act as a centriole then it is connected \\nby a rhizoplast to a centriole or to the nucleus. At the tip of the main flagellum may be \\na very fine and piece or mastigoneme, or the main axis of the flagellum may bear fine, \\nflexible lateral processes or mastigonemes on one side or on both sides. Mastigonemes \\nconstitute the so-called flimmer or ciliary flagellum.

In primitive forms cilia cover the entire \\nbody, but in more specialized forms cilia are restricted to certain regions only. Cilia arise \\nfrom kinetosomes, from each kinetosome arises a rhizoplast which does not join the \\nnucleus, nor do cilia bear any mastigonemes. Running slightly to the right of a longitudinal \\nrow of kinetosomes is a delicate thread called kinetodesma. A row of kinetosomes with \\nits kinetodesmata forms a longitudinal unit called kinety, all kinetia of an animal constitue \\nits infraciliary system. Infraciliary system is characteristic of all ciliates, even in those forms \\nin which cilia are lost in the adults the infraciliary system is retained. \\nNutrition \\nNutrition is a process in which food is taken in, digested, absorbed and assimilated; \\nin fact, it is the process by which the organisms derive their nutrients essential for the \\ngrowth and maintenance of their life activities. The modes of nutrition vary greatly in \\nProtozoa because of their various mode of living habits. However, in Protozoa, the nutrition \\nis of the following types: \\n1. Holozoic or Zootrophic \\nMajority of Protozoa nutrite holozoically, i.e., like animals on solid food. The food \\nof protozoa consists of micro-organism like bacteria, diatoms, rotifers, crustacean larvae, \\nother protozoans, algae, small fragments of large animals and plants, etc. This mode of \\nnutrition essentially involves the processes like intake of food, i.e., ingestion, digestion, \\nabsorption and egestion of undigested residues. \\n(a) Ingestion: The mode of food ingestion in Protozoa is characteristically referred \\nto as phagocytosis or phagotrophy. In fact, in flagellates which are colourless or who \\nhave lost their chromatophores capture food with the help of their flagella. The captured \\nfood is ingested either at definite sites on their naked bodies like Budo or through \\ncharacteristic oral apparatus like Euglena where cytostome and cy~opharynx help in \\ningestion. In some other flagellates like Perallema, special rod-like structures called trichites \\nhelp in capturing the food. In Sarcodina, pseudopodia help in food capturing by forming \\nfood cups. \\n(b) Digestion: Digestion in Protozoa is intracellular within food vacuoles. The food \\nvacuoles undergo changes in pH and in their size during digestion. At first the contents \\nof the food vacuole are acidic and the vacuoles decrease in size, during this phase living \\nprey dies. After the initial acid phase the cytoplasm of the protozoan produces enzymes \\nin an alkaline medium, the enzymes pass into the food vacuoles and the vacuoles increase \\nin size and become alkaline. Then the contents of the vacuoles are digested. In fact, \\nproteolytic and carbohydrate digesting enzymes are reported in Protozoa; the proteins are'),\n",

The carbohydrates are hydrolysed in alkaline medium. The fat digesting \\nenzymes have also been reported in some Protozoa. \\n(c) Absorption and assimilation: The digested food from the food vacuole is diffused \\nout into the endoplasm and finally assimilated in the body to manufacture the protoplasm. \\nThe excess of food is stored in form of glycogen paramylon, paraglycogen bodies in the \\nendoplasm. \\n(d) Egestion: The undigestible remains of the food are egested out from the body \\nat any body surface, eg., in Amoeba. But ciliates possess a definite opening for the egestion \\nof undigested remains called cytoproct or cytopyge. . \\n2. Pinocytosis \\nPinocytois or cell-drinking has also been reported in some Protozoa like Amoeba \\nproteus, and also in certain flagellates and ciliates. It is related to the ingestion of liquid \\nfood by invagination of the general body surface. It may occur at any part of the body; \\nduring pinocytosis, some pinocytic channels are formed from the outer body surface deep \\ninto the body. The inner ends of these channels contain pinocytic vesicles or pinosomes \\nwhich get separated after engulfing liquid food through the channels. The separated \\npinosomes become the food vacuoles. This process is induced in presence of certain salts \\nand some proteins. \\n3. Autotrophic or Holophytic Nutrition \\nProtozoa with chlorophyll or some allied pigment can manufacture complex organic \\nfood, like those of green plants, from simple inorganic substances, e.g., Euglena, Noctiluca. \\nOften there may be protein bodies called pyrenoids which are the centres of photosynthesis. \\nSome protozoa have no chromatophores but they have chlorophyll-bearing algae \\nZooxantllellae or Zooc1zlorellae which manufacture organic food for the host by photosynthesis, \\ne.g., Ste1ltor, Paramaecium bursaria. Nitrates or ammonium compounds are sufficient as the \\nsource of nitrogen for autotrophic forms. \\n4. Saprozoic Nutrition \\nSome Protozoa absorb complex organic substances in solution through the body \\nsurface by the process of osmosis called osmotrophy. These protozoa are called saprozoic. \\nSaprozoic forms need ammonium salts, amino acids, or peptones for their nutritional \\nrequirements. Decaying of animals and plants in water forms protein and carbohydrates. \\nThe saprozoic Protozo,!-are usually parasites like MonoClJstis. \\n5. Parasitic Nutrition \\nThe parasitic forms feed either holozoically or saprozoically. Thus, the parasites \\nmay be grouped into two categories on the nature of food and their mode of feeding: \\n(i) Food - robbers: The parasites feeding upon the undigested or digested food stuffs \\nof their hosts are known as food-robbers, such as some ciliate parasities like Nyctot/zems, \\nBalantidium. \\n(ii) Pathogenic: The protozoan parasites causing harm to their hosts, usually feed \\nupon the living tissues of the host. They absorb liquid food through their general body \\nsurface eg., TnJPanosoma, Plasmodium, etc.'),\n",

Coprozoic Nutrition \\nCertain free-living protozoans are in habit of feeding upon the faecal matters of the \\nother organisms like ClamydophnJs and Dimastigamoeba. \\n7. Mixotrophic Nutrition \\nSome protozoa nourish themselves ,by more than one method at the same time or \\nat different times due to change in environment. This is called mixotrophic nutrition, e.g., \\nEuglena gracilis and Perallema are both saprozoic and autotrophic in their nutrition, and \\nsome flagellates are both autorophic and zootrophic. \\nREPRODUCTION \\nThe mode of reproduction in protozoa is highly variable among different group \\nalthough it is primarily a cell division. Protozoa reproduce both asexually and sexually. \\nAsexual Reproduction \\n1. Equal or binary fission: Equal or binary fission takes place for reproducing and \\nalso for gamete formation. Usually there is a centriole within the nucleus, b'.lt unlike \\nmetazoa no asters are formed, moreover the nuclear membrane persists intact during \\ndivision in most Protozoa. The nucleus elongates and divides amitotically into two parts \\nwhich travel apart, then the cell constricts in the middle to form two daughter cells. \\nMacronuclei of ciliates divide amitotically. Binary fission is simple in Sarcodina like \\nAmoeba where the plane of division is not definite and it is usually transverse in ciliates \\nlike Paramecium but in most flagellates like Euglena it is longitudinal in which the nucleus \\nelongate~ transversely, but the cell divides length wise, while binary fission is oblique \\nin certain cases like Ceratiu1ll. In binary fission (in flagellates) a single flagellum is retained \\nusually by one daughter cell, and the basal granule divided into two, the new basal \\ngranule forms a flagellum in the other daughter cell. When there are many flagella they \\nare distributed among the daughter cells which grow new flagella to co~plete the number. \\nCilia are shared by daughter cells and new cilia are formed by kinetosomes to complete \\nthe number. Chromatophores usually divide but contractile vacuoles rarely divide, they \\nare generally shared or are made anew. Complex organelles are destroyed and then re\\xad\\nmade in the daughter cells. \\n2. Multiple Fission: The nucleus divides repeatedly without division of the cytoplasm, \\nlater the cytoplasm separates into as many parts as there are nuclei, usually some residual \\ncytoplasm is left unsegmented. If multiple fission produces four or more young ones by \\nequal cell division, and the young ones do not separate till the process is completed, then \\nsuch cell division is spoken of as repeated fission, e.g., Vorticella. Multiple fission produces \\nsmall cells which may grow into adults or they may become gametes which require \\nfertilization to form sporozoites (Plasmodium). The multiple fission may lead either to \\nasexual or sexual reproduction. \\n3. Plasmotomy: An asexual division of a multinucleate animal in which the \\ncytoplasm divides but the nuclei do not is called plasmotomy (Opalina, Pelomyxa). Later \\neach daughter cell regains the normal number of nuclei by nuclear division.\"),\n",

Budding: An unequal division of the parent body produces one or more buds \\nwhich may separate from the parent, the nucleus of the bud is a part of the parent nucleus, \\ne.g., Arcella. The bud is smaller than the parent; the buds may grow into adults or may \\nbecome gametes. When buds are formed on the surface of the parent, then this is known \\nas exogenous budding, e.g., Noctiluca produces hundreds of buds on its surface as small \\nprotuberances. When the buds are formed inside the cytoplasm and may remain within \\nthe parent, then the process is called endogenous budding, e.g, Arcella. Endogenous \\nbudding may be a method of asexual reproduction or it may bring about formation of \\ngametes, eg., Arcella becomes multinucleate, protoplasm collects around the nuclei to form \\nmany amoebulae which escape from the parent and grow into adults. \\n5. parthenogenesis: Parthenogenesis is the ability of the gametes to develop into \\nadults without fertilization by gametes of the opposite sex, the gamete possessing this \\npower is almost always the female one, e.g, in Actinophnjs two individuals get enclosed \\nin a cyst, each divides to form two gametes, one gamete of an individual conjugates with \\na gamete of the other individual, the remaining gamete of each individual develops \\nparthenogenetically into an adult. Thus, gametes which have been unable to undergo cross \\nfertilization develop by parthenogenesis. Potential gametes of Chlamydomonas will grow \\nand divide to become adults when they have missed syngamy. Endomixis of ciliates is \\nalso a parthenogenetic phenomenon. The chromosome condition in parthenogenesis may \\nbe expected to be haploid since no fertilization occurs, but it is generally diploid. \\n6. Regeneration: Regeneration is the capacity to form new tissues to replace a lost \\npart, this capacity varies inversely with the complexity of an organism. In protozoa any \\nnucleated portion is capable of regeneration, while non-nucleated portions are not, e.g, \\nStentor has a long chain-like nucleus, if the animal is cut transversely into say three parts, \\nthen each piece having a portion of the nucleus will regenerate the missing portions and \\nthree Stentors will be formed. \\nSexual Reproduction \\nSexual reproduction occurs by the following methods in Protozoa: \\n1. Syngamy ot' copulation: Syngamy is the union and complete fusion of two gametes \\nof the same species. If the two gametes are identical morphologically, though they may \\nbe different physiologically, then they are isogametes and their syngamy is isogamy \\n(MonOCljstis). If the gametes differ in size and morphology, then they ar~ anisogametes and \\ntheir syng2my is anisogamy (Plasmodium). The smaller, usually numerous and motile \\ngametes are male or microgametes; the larger, generally few and inactive gametes are \\nfemale or macrogametes. Meiosis or reduction division occurs generally in the formation \\nof gametes, but in many flagellates meiosis is post-zygotic, that is, it occurs after the \\nformation of the zygote. The fusion of two gametes produces a zygote, its nucleus is formed \\nby the fusion of nuclei of gametes, and it is called a synkaryon. The zygote may develop \\ndirectly into an adult, or it may encyst and undergo multiple fission. Syngamy whether \\nisogamous or anisogamous is always exogamous, that is, the fusing gametes come from \\ndifferent parents, hence, sex distinction may be said to exist in Protozoa, though sexes \\nmay not be distinguished.\"),\n",

Conjugation: Conjugation is a temporary union of two Protozoa of the same \\nspecies for an exchange of nuclear material without the fusion of their cytoplasm, e.g, \\nin Paramecium caudataum. In ciliates there is no formation of distinct gametes. \\nA sexual process somewhat intermediate between syngamy & conjugation occurs \\nin Vorticella in which one individual forms one to four microgametes by repeated fission, \\nand the other individual forms a macrogamete by nuclear modification, the macrogamete \\nis a hologamete because it is not formed by fission. Thus, Vorticella shows sexual \\ndimorphism in its gametes, a microgamete fuses with a macrogamete to form a zygote. \\nThe zygote by three divisions produces seven cells which grow into adults. \\nIn both syngamy and conjugation there is a rejuvenation of the animal by \\nreplacement of the macronucleus with material from the synkaryon, both processes \\nproduce new types of individuals by combination of genes, hence they give the race a \\nbetter chance of survival. \\n3. Automixis: In some Protozoa the nucleus divides into two, the two nuclei fuse \\ntogether, this is called automixis. If the two nuclei which fuse are present in a single cell, \\nthen the process is called autogamy, but if the two fusing nuclei are present in two different \\ncells, then the process is known as paedogamy. Autogamy occurs in a single Paramecium \\naurelia which provides both the fusing nuclei to form a synkaryon. Paedogamy occurs \\nin Actinosphaerium and Actinophnjs in which two cells of a secondary cyst and their two \\nremaining nuclei fuse to form a zygote which reproduces by binary fission. \\nSexual reproduction of Protozoa differs from the sexual reproduction of metazoa \\nin that the protozoan is both somatic and gametic. For many generations there is a somatic \\nphase in which binary fission occurs, then one generation is gametic in which syngamy \\nor conjugation takes place. The function of binary fission is reproduction or increasing \\nthe number of individuals, and the function of syngamy or conjugation is rejuvenation, \\nbut not reproduction although it is called 'Sexual reproduction'. In the life cycle of some \\nprotozoa binary fission alternates with syngamy, this alternation may have regular sexual \\nand asexual generations (Elphidium), but more usually binary fission is repeated for many \\ngenerations continuously, and it is broken only occasionally by syngamy or conjugation. \\nProbably the occasional conjugation occurs only when the physiological condition of the \\nanimal becomes different from normal (Parall~'ecium). \\n4. Endomixis: It is a type of nuclear reorganization which usually occurs when \\nconjugation is prevented. In this case fusion of pro-nuclei does not take place. But the \\nmacronucleus is reorganized from micronuclear material. The reorganized macronucleus \\naccelerates the metabolic activities of the individual and helps in the renewal of the vigour \\nas is reported in Paramecium aurelia. \\n5. Hemixis: It has been reported in the various species of Paramecium like P. caudatum, \\nP. aurelia and P. multi11licrOllucleatu11l. In this case, the macronucleus throws away its many \\nfragments of different sizes in the cytoplasm which are absorbed in it.

Parasitic \\nmode of life is a secondary state, the parasites having arisen frequently and independently \\nfrom free-living ancestors. The relationship of a parasite to its host is of varying degrees \\nof intimacy, the parasite may be epizoic or endozoic. \\nThe Flagellate Protozoa: The Mastigophora \\nThe Mastigophora are protozoa that always bear flagella as the locomotor organelles. \\nIn contrast to the ciliates, in which cell division is transverse, flagellate protozoa undergo \\nlongitudinal division. This mode of division has already been described for a photosynthetic \\nflagellate, Euglena. In addition to leucophytes, this protozoan group includes many \\nrepresentatives that show no resemblance to photosynthetic flagellates and are for the most \\npart parasites of animals. \\nThe trypanosomes are frequently parasitic in vertebrates, where they develop in the \\nbloodstream, being transmitted from host to host by the bite of insects. The cell is slender \\nand leaf-shaped, its single flagellum being directed posteriorly and attached through part \\nof its length to the body of the cell, to form an undulating membrane. The trypanosomes \\nare osmotrophic protozoa, which absorb their nutrients from the blood of the host. \\nOther parasitic flagellates inhabit the gut of vertebrates or invertebrates. The \\ntrichomonads, which have four to six flagella are harmless inhabitants of the gut of \\nvertebrates. \\nThe Amoeboid Protozoa: The Rhizopoda \\nThe Rhizopoda are protozoa in which ameboid locomotion is the predominant mode \\nof cell movement, although some of them are able to produce flagella as well. The simplest \\nmembers of this group are amebae, which have characteristically amorphous cells as a \\nresult of the continuous changes of shape brought about by the extension of psedudopodia.'),\n",

A few \\ninhabit the animal gut, including forms that cause disease (amebic dysentery). Other \\nmembers of the Rhizopoda have a well-defined cell form, as the -result of the formation \\nof an exoskeleton or shell (typical of the foraminifera) or an endoskeleton (typical of the \\nheliozoan and radiolaria). \\nThe Ciliate Protozoa: The Ciliophora \\nThe ciliate protozoa are a very large and varied group of aquatic, phagotrophic \\norganisms that are particular widely distributed in fresh water. The ciliates share a number \\nof fundamental cellular characters that distinguish them sharply from all other protests. \\nThis suggest that despite the very great internal diversity of this group, it is one class \\nof protozoa that may have had a single common evolutionary origin. \\nAt some time in the life history, the cell is motile by means of numerous short, hair \\nlike projections, structurally homologous with flagella, which are termed cilia. Each cilium \\narises from a basal structure, the kinetosome, which is homologous with the kinetosome \\nof a flagellum; however, in ciliates the kinetosomes are inter connected by rows of fibrils \\ncalled kinetodesmata to form very elaborate compound locomotor structures termed kineties. \\nThis internal system persists, even if the cell is devoid of cilia. \\nCLASSIFICATION \\nThe classification followed here is given by the committee on Taxonomy & \\nTaxonomic problems of the society of protozoologists (Honigberg et al. 1964). According \\nto Honigberg et al., (1964) Protozoa have been classified into four subphyla. \\nSub Phylum 1 \\nSarcomastigophora \\n1. Organelles of locomotion are pseudopodia or flagella. \\n2. Nucleus is of single type (monomorphic). \\n3. There is no spore formation. \\n4. Syngamy occurs in reproduction. \\nSuper class \\nA. Mastigophora \\n1. They are commonly called flagellates. \\n2. Organelles of locomotion in adults are flagella. \\n3. Body is covered by pellicle. \\n4. Binary fission is longitudinal. \\n5. They are mostly free-living though some are parasitic. \\nClass 1 Phytomastigophora \\n1. They generally possess chromatophores.'),\n",

IndiaPREFACE \\nMicro-organisms are the oldest inhabitants of earth. They are masters in versality \\nand adaptability to the changing environment. They will definitely prove to be most cost\\xad\\neffective partners in our efforts for sustainable development. The microorganisms influence \\nthe man in several ways. The diversity of their activities varies from causing diseases \\nin human and other animals and plants to the production of various useful products. \\nMicrobes have a very significant role in the era of biotechnology and hence microbiology \\nhas today come forth as one of the most demanding subject in the science stream of \\ngraduate and post graduate courses. \\nThe contents of the present book have been divided into 17 chapters covering basic \\nstudies of microorganisms excluding their application part. Book covers detailed information \\non history of microbiology, evolution of microorganisms, classification, Nomenclature and \\nlatest information of Bergey\\'s manual. Chapter covers information about structure, \\nmetabolism reproduction, function and diseases caused by Bacteria, Viruses, Bacterial \\nviruses, Plant viruses, Animal viruses, Archaea, Mycoplasma and Phytoplasma. General \\naccount of cyanobacteria including their nutrition and reproduction have been given. Book \\nprovides detailed information about Gram negative and Gram positive Bacteria and \\nEukaryotes viz. Algae and fungi. \\nAt end of book appendix and various types of questions have been given for the \\nbenefit of students. A concise account of microorganisms is given in the text book, so \\nas to make the students aware of the nature and other important aspects of the \\nmicroorganisms. \\nPresent book is a compilation of information on microbiology done in a manner \\nso as to meet the need of students of microbiology of the Indian Universities.

Because most of \\nthe microorganisms are only a few thousands of a mm in size, they can only be seen \\nwith the aid of microscope. Due to the invisibility of microbes tc the naked eye and \\nthe need for special techniques to study them, microbiology was the last of the three \\nmajor divisions in biology (the other two are botany and zoology) to develop. \\nAt present there is general agreement to include five major groups as microorganisms. \\nThe subdivisions are : \\nMicrobiology \\nVirology \\n(Viruses) \\nBacteriology \\n(Bacteria) \\nI \\nMycology \\n(Fungi) \\nI \\nPhycology \\n(Algae) \\nProtozoology \\n(Protozoa) \\nMicroorganisms are present everywhere on earth which includes humans, animals, \\nplants and other living creatures, soil, water and atmosphere.

Microorganism play an important role in the recycling of organic and \\ninorganic material through their roles in the C, Nand S cycles, thus playing an important \\npart in the maintenance of the stability of the biosphere. They are also the source of \\nnutrients at the base of all ectotropical food chains and webs.

These interactions include: ecology, genetics, metabolism, infection, disease, \\nchemotherapy, immunology, genetic engineering, industry and agriculture.

The term \\nmicrobiology was given by French chemist Louis Pasteur (1822-95). \\nMicrobiology is said to have its roots in the great expansion a:r:td development of \\nthe biological sciences that took place after 1850. The term microbe was first used by \\nSedillot (1878). \\nMicroorganism were first living things to appear on earth and the study of fossil\\xad\\nremains indicate that microbial infections and epidemic diseases existed thousands of \\nyears ago. Varo and Columella in the first century BC postulated that diseases w~re \\ncaused by invisible beings (Animalia minuta) inhaled or ingested. Fracastorius of \\nVerona (1546) proposed a contagium vivum as a possible cause of infections disease \\nand Von Plenciz (1762) suggested that each disease was caused by a separate agent. \\nRogen Bacon in the 13th century postulated that disease is produced by invisible \\nliving creatures. This suggestion was made again in 1546 by a physician Girolamo \\nFracastoro (1478-1553) of North Italy. He wrote a treatise-De contagione in which he \\nsaid disease was caused by minute \\'seed\\' or \\'germ\\' and spread from person to person. \\nHis work represents a great landmark in the doctorine of infectious diseases. \\nIn 1665, Robert Hook an English scientist used a simple lens that magnified objects \\napproximately 30X. He examined thin slices of cork, the bark of oak tree and he referred \\nto as \"cells\". Later the Hook work was followed by Matthias Schleiden and Theodore \\nSchwann who examined a variety of organisms and later became foundation of \"Cell \\nTheory\". The discovery of microbiology as a discipline could be\" traced along the \\nfollowing historical eras : \\nDiscoverv \\nf,ra \\nTransition \\nPeriod \\nI \\nGolden \\nAge \\nI \\nIn 20th Century: \\nEra of Molecular BiologyHISTORY OF MICROBIOLOGY 5 \\nDISCOVERY ERA \\nThis period concerns with the discovery of microbial world that has been dominated \\nby Antony Van Leeuvenhoek \\nAntony Van Leeuvenhoek (1632-1723) of Delft, Holland (Netherland) was the first \\nperson to observe and accurately describe microorganisms (bacteria and protozoa) called \\n\\'animalcules\\' (little animals) in 1676. Actually he was a Dutch linen merchant but spent \\nmuch of his spare time constructing simple microscopes composed of double convex \\nlenses held between two silver plates. He constructed over 250 small powerful \\nmicroscopes that could magnify around 50-300 times. Leeuvenhoek was the 1st person \\nto produce precise and correct descriptions of bacteria and protozoa using microscope \\nhe made himself. Because of this extraordinary contribution to microbiology he is \\nconsidered as the \"Father of bacteriology and protozoology\". He wrote over 200 letters \\nwhich was transmitted as a series of letters from 1674-1723 to Royal society in London \\nduring a 50 years period. He wrote four volumes of Arcana Naturae opeet Beneficio \\nExquisite Simom11l Mierovopionun Deteeta. \\nTRANSITION PERIOD \\nAlthough, there were a number of Significant developments in microbiology during \\nVan Leeuvenhoek\\'s time, Peoples were interested to correlate diseases with microbes. \\nThe main aspects were to solve the controversy over spontaneous generation which \\nincludes experimentations mainly of Francesco Redi, John Needham, Lazzaro Spallanzani \\nand Nicolas Appert etc and to know the disease transmission which mainly includes \\nthe work of Ignaz Semmelweis and John Snow. \\nFrancesco Redi (1626-1697): The ancient belief in spontaneous generation was first \\nof all challenged by Redi, an Italian physician, who carried out a series of experiments \\non decaying meat and its ability to produce maggots spontaneously. Redi was the first \\nwho put the theory of spontaneous generation to test by conducting a simple experiment \\nin which he placed meat in three jars. One jar was covered with fine gauze, second \\nwas covered with paper and third was left uncovered. Flies entered the jar that was \\nopen to air i.e. left uncovered and landed on meat where they laid their egg that later \\ndeveloped into maggots. The other two pieces of meat did not produce maggots \\nspontaneously. However flies were attracted to the gauze covered jars and laid their \\neggs on the gauze and maggots subsequently developed without access to the meat, \\nindicating that maggots were the offspring of the flies and did not arise from some \\n\\'vital source\\' in the meat as previously believed. \\nJohn Needham (1713-1781): He was probably the greatest supporter of the theory \\nof spontaneous generation. He proposed that tiny organisms the animalcules arose \\nspontaneously on his mutton gravy. He covered the flasks with cork as done by Redi \\nand even heated some flasks. Still the microbes appeared on mutton broth. \\nLazzaro Spallanzani (1729-1799): He was an Italian Naturalist who attempted to \\nrefute Needham\\'s experiment. He boiled beef broth for longer period, removed the air \\nfrom the flask and then sealed the container. Followed incubation no growth was \\nobserved by him in these flasks. He showed that the heated nutrients could still grow6 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nanimalcules when exposed to air by simply making a small crack in the neck. Thus \\nSpallanzani disproved the doctrine of spontaneous generation. \\nNicolas Appert followed the idea of Spallanzani\\'s work. He was a French wine \\nmaker who showed that soups and liquids can be preserved by heating them extensively \\nin thick champagine bottles. \\nIgnaz Semmelweis and John Snow were the two persons who showed a growing \\nawareness of the mode of disease transmission. \\nTwo German scholars Schulze (1815-1873) and Theodor Schwan (1810-1882) \\nviewed that air was the source of microbes and sought to prove this by passing air \\nthrough hot glass tubes or strong chemicals into boiled infusions in flasks. The infusion \\nin both the cases remained free from the microbes. \\nGeorge Schroeder and Theodor Von Dusch (1854) were the first to introduce the \\nidea of using cotton plugs for plugging microbial culture tubes. \\nDarwin (1859) in his book, \\'Origin of the Species\\' showed that the human body \\ncould be conceived as a creature susceptible to the laws of nature. He was of the opinion \\nthat disease may be a biological phenomenon, rather than any magic. \\n1220-1252 \\n1546 \\n1658 \\n1665 \\n1668 \\n1676 \\n1688 \\n1776 \\n1786 \\n1798 \\n1799 \\n1839 \\n1857 \\n1858 \\nTABLE 1 \\nHistorical \\nDevelopment in the Field of Microbiology \\n- Rogen Bacon, disease produced by invisible living creatures. \\n- Girolamo Fracastoro, disease was caused by minute \\'seed\\' or \\'germ\\'s \\nspread from person to person. \\n- Athanasius Kircher, 1st recognize the significance of bacteria and other \\nmicrobes in disease. \\n- Robert Hooke, referred as \\'cells\\'. \\n- Franceso Redi, demonstrate the fallacies in the spontaneous generation \\ntheory. \\n- Antony Van Leeuvenhoek discovers I animalcules\\' . \\n- Redi Publishes work on spontaneous generation of maggaot. \\n- Lazzaro Spallanzani conducts experiment that dispute spontaneous \\ngeneration. \\n- Muller produces first classification of bacteria. \\n- Edward Jenner introduces Cowpox vaccination for small pox. \\n- Spallanzani attacks on the theory of spontaneous generation. \\n- Theodor Schwann (german zoologist) and Mathias Schleiden (botanist) \\nformulate the cell theory. \\n- Pasteur shows that lactic acid fermentation is due to a microorganism. \\n- Rudolf virchow, (all cell originate from pre existing cells).HISTORY OF MICROBIOLOGY 7 \\n1861 \\n1867 \\n1869 \\n1876-77 \\n1881 \\n1882 \\n1884 \\n1885 \\n1887 \\n1892 \\n1897 \\n1899 \\n1906 \\n1908 \\n1910 \\n1915-17 \\n1923 \\n1928 \\n1929 \\n1935 \\n1944 \\n1946 \\n1952 \\n1953 \\n1954 \\n1957 \\n1958 \\n- Pasteur shows that microorganism do not arise by spontaneous generation. \\n- Lister publishes his work on antiseptic surgery. \\n- Johann Meischer discovers nucleic acids. \\n- Koch demonstrate that anthrax is caused by Bacillus allthracis. \\n- Koch cultures bacteria on gelatin. \\n- Koch discovers tubercle bacillus. \\n- Koch\\'s postulates first published. \\nMetchinikoff describes phagocytosis. \\nAutoclave developed. \\nGram stain developed. \\n- Pasteur develops rabies vaccine. \\n- Petridish developed by Richard Petri. \\n- D.

More important there was an acceptance \\nof their work by the scientific community throughout the world and a willingness to \\ncontinue and expand the work. During this period, we see the real beginning of \\nmicrobiology as a discipline of biology. \\nLouis Pasteur: Pasteur a French microbiologist, performed a series of experiments \\nto prove that microorganisms were present in the air and were not spontaneously \\nproduced. He filled several round bottomed flasks with nutrient solution and fashioned \\ntheir openings into elongated, swan neck shaped tubes. The flask\\'s opening were freely \\nopen to the air but curved so that gravity would cause any air borne dust particle to \\ndeposit in the lower parts of the neck. The flasks were heated to sterilize the broth \\nand then incubated. No growth occurred even though the contents of the flasks were \\nexposed to the air. Pasteur pointed out that no growth took place because dust and \\ngerms had been trapped on the walls of the curved necks but if the necks were broken \\noff so that dust fell directly down into the flask, microbial growth commenced \\nimmediately. Some of these ingenious little flasks are still on display at the Pasteur \\nInstitute in Paris in their original sterile form. This experiment clearly showed that \\nmicroorganisms present on or in non-living materials such as dust or water were \\nresponsible for the contamination of sterile solutions. Pasteur, thus in 1861 finallyHISTORY OF MICROBIOLOGY 9 \\nresolved the controversy of spontaneous generation versus biogenesis and proved that \\nmicroorganisms are not spontaneously generated from inanimate matter but arise from \\nother microorganisms. \\nLouis Pasteur, a professor of chemistry at the Un iversity of Lille, France. He was \\nresponsible for saving a principal industry of France i.e. manufacture of wine and beer. \\nHe found that fermentation of fruits and grains, resulting in alcohol, was brought about \\nby microbes and also determined that bacteria were responsible for the spoilage of wine \\nduring fermentation. Pasteur in 1897 suggested that mild heating at 62.8°C (145°F) for \\n30 minutes rather than boiling was enough to destroy the undesirable organisms without \\nruining the taste of the product, the process was called Pasteurization. Pasteurization \\nwas introduced into the united states on a commercial basis in 1892. His work led to \\nthe development of the germ theory of disease. \\nFig. 1 : Photograph Pasteur\\'s experiment disproving theory of spontanous generation \\nJohn Tyndall (1820 - 1893): An English physicist, deal a final blow to spontaneous \\ngeneration in 1877. He conducted experiments in an aseptically designed box to prove \\nthat dust indeed carried the germs . He demonstrated that if no dust was present, sterile \\nbroth remained free of microbial growth for indefinite period even if it was directly \\nexposed to air. He discovered highly resistant bacterial structure, later known as \\nendospore, in the infusion of hay. Prolonged boiling or intermittent heating was \\nnecessary to kill these spores, to make the infusion completely sterilized, a process known \\nas Tyndallisation. \\nLord Joseph Lister (1827-1912): a famous English surgeon is known for his notable \\ncontribution to the antiseptic treatment for the prevention and cure of wound infections. \\nLister concluded that wound infections too were due to microorganisms. In 1867, he10 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\ndeveloped a system of antiseptic surgery designed to prevent mi<;roorganisms from \\nentering wounds by the application of phenol on surgical dressings and at times it was \\nsprayed over the surgical areas. He also devised a method to destroy microorganisms \\nin the operation theatre by spraying a fine mist of carbolic acid into the air, thus \\nproducing an antiseptic environment. Thus Joseph Lister was the first to introduce aseptic \\ntechniques for control of microbes by the use of physical and chemical agents which \\nare still in use today. Because of this notable contributions, Joseph Lister is known as \\nthe Father of Antiseptic surgery. \\nRobert Koch (1893-1910) gave the first direct demonstration of the role of bacteria \\nin causing disease. He was a german physician who first of all isolated anthrax bacillus \\n(Bacillus alltlzracis, the cause of anthrax) in 1876. He perfected the technique of isolating \\nbacteria in pure culture. He also introduced the use of solid culture media in 1881 by \\nusing gelatin as a solidifying agent. In 1882 he discovered Mycobacterium tuberculosis. \\nHe proposed Koch postulate which were published in 1884 and are the corner stone \\nof the germ theory of diseases and are still in use today to prove the etiology (specific \\ncause) of an infectious disease. The postulates are: \\n1. The suspected microorganism must always be found in diseased but never in \\nhealthy individuals. \\n2. The microorganism must be isolated in a pure culture (one free of all other \\ntypes of microbes) on a nutrient medium. \\n3. The same disease must result when the isolated microorganism is inoculated \\ninto a healthy host. \\n4. The same organism must by reisolated from the experimentally infected host. \\nAlthough viruses and a few other microbes cannot be cultured in artificial media, \\nKoch\\'s postulates are still used today for the cause of most infectious diseases. \\nRobert Koch also used gelatin to prepare solid media but it was not an ideal \\nsolidifying agent because of the two important reasons (i) since gelatin is a protein, \\nit is digested by many bacteria capable of producing a proteolytic exoenzyme gelatinase \\nthat hydrolyses the protein to amino acids and (ii) It melts when the temperature rises \\nabove 25°C. R. Koch will be remembered for both i.e. his contribution in the discovery \\nof important disease producing microorganism and his fundamental contribution to \\nbacteriological techniques. \\nFanne Eilshemius Hesse (1850 - 1934) one of Koch\\'s assistant first proposed the \\nuse of agar in culture media. Agar was superior to gelatin because of its higher melting \\n(i.e. 96°C) and solidifying (i.e. 40-45°C) points than gelatin and was not attacked by \\nmost bacteria. Koch\\'s another assistant Richard Petri in 1887 developed the Petri dish \\n(plate), a container used for solid culture media. Thus contribution of Robert Koch, \\nFannie Fannie Hesse and Richard Petri made possible the isolation of pure cultures of \\nmicroorganisms and directly stimulated progress in all areas of microbiology. \\nEdward Jenner (1749-1823) an English physician was the first to prevent small pox. \\nHe was impressed by the observation that countryside milk maid who contacted cowpox \\n(Cowpox is a milder disease caused by a virus closely related to small pox) while milkingHISTORY OF MICROBIOLOGY 11 \\nwere subsequently immune to small pox. On May 14th, 1796 he proved that inoculating \\npeople with pus from cowpox lesions provided protection against small pox. Jenner in \\n1798, published his results on 23 successful vaccinators. Eventually this process was \\nknown as vaccination, based on the latin word \\'Vacca\\' meaning cow. Thus the use of \\ncow pox virus to protect small pox disease in humans became popular replacing the \\nrisky technique of immunizing with actual small pox material. \\nJenner\\'s experimental significance was realized by Pasteur who next applied this \\nprinciple to the prevention of anthrax and it worked. He called the attenuated cultures \\nvaccines (Vacca = cow) and the process as vaccination. Encouraged by the successful \\nprevention of anthrax by vaccination, Pasteur marched ahead towards the service of \\nhumanity by making a vaccine for hydrophobia or rabies (a disease transmitted to people \\nby bites of dogs and other animals). As with Jenner\\'s vaccination for small pox, principle \\nof the preventive treatment of rabies also worked fully which laid the foundation of \\nmodern immunization programme against many dreaded diseases like diphtheria, \\ntetanus, pertussis, polio and measles etc. \\nElie Metchnikoff (1845-1916) proposed the phagocytic theory of immunity in 1883. \\nHe discovered that some blood leukocytes, white blood cells (WBC) protect against \\ndisease by engulfing disease causing bacteria. These cells were called phagocytes and \\nthe process phagocytosis. Thus human blood cells also confer immunity, referred to as \\ncellular immunity. \\nEmile Roux (1853-1933) and Alexandre Yersin, the two notable French bacteriologists \\ndemonstrated the production of toxin in filtrates of broth cultures of the diphtheria \\norganism. Emil von Behring (1854 -1917) and Shibasaburo Kitasato (1852-1931) both \\ncolleagues of Robert Koch, in 1890 discovered tetanus (lock jaw) antitoxin. Only about \\na week after the announcement of the discovery of tetanus antitoxin, Von Behring in \\n1890 reported on immunization against diphtheria by diphtheria antitoxin. The discovery \\nof toxin-antitoxin relationship was very important to the development of science of \\nimmunology. \\nWhile all these milestones were being laid in the field of microbiology, an English \\nsurgeon, Joseph Lister (1827-1912) was trying to combat the microbes that caused post \\noperative and wound infection disaster searched for a way to keep bacteria out of \\nwounds and the incisions made by surgeons. He used a dilute solution of carbolic acid \\nto soak surgical dressings that kept the wounds free from microbial infection and healing \\ntook place rapidly. So remarkable was his success that the technique was quickly \\naccepted and the principle of present day aseptic technique was established. \\nPaul Ehrlich (1854-1915) in 1904 found that the dye Trypan Red was active against \\nthe trypanosome that causes African sleeping sickness and could be used therapeutically. \\nThis dye with antimicrobial activity was referred to as a \\'magic bullet\\'. Subsequently \\nin 1910, Ehrlich in collaboration with Sakahiro Hata, a japanese physician, introduced \\nthe drug Salvarsan (arsenobenzol) as a treatment for syphilis caused by Treponema \\npallidu11l. Ehrlich\\'s work had laid important foundations for many of the developments \\nto come and the use of Salvarsen marked the beginning of the eni of chemotherapy \\nand the use of chemicals that selectively inhibit or kill pathogens without causing damage \\nto the patient.12 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nGerhard Domagk of Germany in 1935 experimented with numerous synthetic dyes \\nand reported that Prontosil, a red dye used for staining leather, was active against \\npathogenic, Streptococci and Staphylococci in mice even though it had no effect against \\nthat same infectious agent in a test tube. In the same year two French scientists Jacques \\nand Therese Trefonel showed that the compound Prontosil was broken down within \\nthe body of the animal to sulfanilamide (Sulfa drug) the true active factor. Domagk \\nwas awarded nobel prize in 1939 for the discovery of the first sulpha drug. \\nThe credit for the discovery of first \\'wonder drug\\' penicillin in 1929 goes to Sir \\nAlexander Fleming of England, a Scottish physician and bacteriologist. Fleming had \\nbeen actually interested in searching something that would kill pathogens ever since \\nworking on wound infections during the first world war (1914-1918). One day in 1928 \\nupon his return from a week\\'s vacation, Fleming observed that a plate of Staphylococcus \\naureus had become contaminated with a green mold Penicillium notahHn which had \\naccidentially fallen in plate. Observing this plate, Fleming noted that the colonies of \\nStaphylococcus bacterium were evidently being destroyed by the nearby Penicillium \\ncolonies. Rather than discarding the contaminated plate, he speculated that the mold \\nwas producing a diffusible substance that inhibited the bacterial growth. Fleming isolated \\nand subcultured the mold for further study. He extracted from the fungus a compound \\nwhich he called penicillin, after the name of the producer organism Penicillium notaium, \\nthat could destroy several pathogenic bacteria. Thus, Sir Alexander Fleming in 1929 \\ndiscovered the first antibiotic (Gr. Anti = against + bios = life, the microbial products \\nthat can kill susceptible microorganism and inhibit their growth) penicillin. The \\ncommercial production of penicillin in the USA began in 1941 Fleming, Florey and Chain \\nshared the nobel prize in 1945 for the discovery and production of penicillin. Penicillium \\nllotatU11l has been replaced with Penicillium cllnJsogenum for the commercial production \\nof penicillin and the current strain of this species modified through mutation, yields \\n85,000 units/ ml of medium (the original mold. P. chnJsogellum synthesized 60 units/ \\nml. Waksman at the Rutgers university, USA discovered another antibiotic, streptomycin \\nproduced by two strains of actinomycete, Streptomyces griseus in 1944. Waksman received \\nthe noble prize in 1952 for his discovery of Streptomycin used in the treatment of \\ntuberculosis, a bacterial disease ca\\'..lsed by Mycobateriu11l tuberculosis that had been \\ndiscovered by Robert Koch in 1882. By 1950, three other microorganism were identified \\nthat produced antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin) from Streptomyces \\nvenezuelae by Dr. Paul R. Burkholder in 1947, Aureomycin from S. aureofaciens by Dr. \\nB.M. Dugger in 1948; and Terramycin from S. rimosus by Finlay, Hobby and collaborators \\nin 1950. \\nA dramatic turn in microbiology research was signaled by the death of Robert Koch \\nin 1910 and advent of world war I. The Pasteur Institute was closed, and the german \\nlaboratories converted for production of blood components used to treat war infections. \\nThus came to an end what many have called the Golden Age of Microbiology. \\nIN 20~ CENTURY: ERA OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY \\nBy the end of 1900, science of microbiology grew up to the adolescence stage and \\nhad come to its own as a branch of the more inclusive field of biology. In the laterHISTORY OF MICROBIOLOGY 13 \\nyears the microorganism were picked up as ideal tools to study various life processes \\nand thus an independent discipline of microbiology, molecular biology was born. The \\nrelative simplicity of the microorganism, their short life span and the genetic homogeneity \\nprovided an authentic simulated model to understand the physiological, biochemical \\nand genetical intricacies of the living organisms. The use of microorganisms as a tool \\nto explore fundamental life processes became attractive due to the following facts: \\n1. They reproduce (grow) very rapidly. \\n2. Can be cultured in small and vast quantities conveniently and rapidly. \\n3. Their growth can be manipulated easily by physical and chemical means and \\ntheir cells can be broken apart or the contents can be separated into fractions \\nof various particle sizes. Because of these characteristics microorganisms were \\nused as research models to determine exactly how various life processes take \\nplace in terms of specific reactions and the specific structures involved. \\nThe list of those who contributed to the development of microbiology is far too \\nlong to recite here in its entirety. Here we shall highlight briefly only few of the important \\nmicrobiological accomplishments. \\nGeorge W. Beadle and Edward 1. Tatum both US Scientists, were the pioneers \\nin the area of microbial genetics. They studied the relationship between genes and \\nenzymes in 1941 using mutants of the bread mold fungus, Neurospora crassa and gave \\nthe concept of one-gene -one enzyme hypothesis. Using mutants of Neurospora, they \\ndemonstrated that there was a direct relationship between a single gene and a single \\nenzyme. Beadle and Tatum hypothesized that the synthesis of the compounds essential \\nfor cell growth must be under genetic control. They also concluded that a defect in \\none gene produced a single defect in an essential enzyme resulting in the growth factor \\nrequirement, that is one gene one - enzyme theory. Lederberg, Beadle and Tatum were \\nawarded the nobel prize in 1958 for the discovery of one gene one enzyme hypothesis. \\nMax Delbruck and Salvadore Luria in 1943 described the genetic nature of viruses. \\nThey also proved that gene mutations were truly spontaneous and not directed by the \\nenvironment. DNA is the genetic material and carried genetic information during \\ntransformation in bacteria was demonstrated in 1944 by Oswald, T. Avery, Colin. M. \\nMaclead and Maclyn McCarty. In 1952 Joshua Lederberg first of all introduced the term \\n\\'Plasmid\\' to describe nonchromosomal genetic material in bacteria. In collaboration with \\nNorton Zinder, a student in his laboratory at Wisconsin, USA, Lederberg discovered \\nthat genetic information could be transferred between bacteria by bacteriophage this \\nprocess was known as transduction. Lederberg along with his wife Esther, developed \\na unique method of studying bacterial mutants, now known as \\'replica plating\\' using \\nthis method it is possible to transfer bacterial colonies from one agar growth plate to \\nother so that each new plate is an exact replica of the original. With this technique, \\nLederberg showed that mutations in bacteria occur randomly and spontaneously. Thus \\ndiscovery made by Lederberg in bacterial genetics - transduction and conjugation in \\nbacteria have made the science of bacterial genetics and have subsequently spawned \\nmany advances including aspects of modern molecular genetics of gene cloning. Thus \\nJ. Lederberg single handedly changed the nature of bacterial genetics and biochemistry.14 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nWatson and Crick in 1953 made most remarkable discovery in genetics by discovering \\nthe molecular structure of DNA providing framework for understanding molecular basis\\' \\nof inheritance and expression of genetic information. Ochoa and Kornberg isolated and \\nsynthesized the enzyme, responsible for production of ribonucleic acids, RNA and DNA \\nthat carry hereditary information for which they received nobel prize in 1959. \\nIn 1968, the nobel prize for physiology and medicine was shared by Robert W. Holley, \\nHargovind Khorana and M.W. Nirenberg for their contribution to the understanding of \\nthe genetic code and its function in protein synthesis. The 1969 nobel prize in medicine \\nand physiology was awarded to Max Dalbruck, Alfred D. Hershey and S.E. Luria for \\nstudying the replication mechanism and genetic structure of bactriophage. Albert Claude, \\nG.E. Palade, Christian D. Duve jointly received the prestigious nobel prize of 1974 for \\nthe isolation of cell parts in order to study the structure and chemistry of individual cell \\nwhich led to the discoveries of ribosome and lysosome. In the following year, 1975 R. \\nDulbeco, HM. Temin and David Baltimore of u.s.A. were awarded the nobel prize for \\nresearching the interaction between tumor virus and genetic material of the cell. In 1976, \\nGajdusek and Blumberg did research leading to nobel prize for a test to show hepatitis \\nvirus in donated blood and to a experimental vaccine against the disease. Two years later, \\nArber, Smith and Nathans were jointly awarded this prize for discovery of restriction \\nenzyme and their application to the problems of molecular genetics. \\nA number of nobel laureates in medicine and physiology awarded the nobel prize \\nfor their work in microbiology. \\nTABLE 2 \\nNobel Laureates in Microbiology \\nYear Nobel laureate Research work \\n1901 Emil A.

The planets and stars, the earth\\'s topography the chemical \\ncompounds of the universe and chemical elements and their sub-atomic particles have \\nundergone gradual and orderly changes is termed as inorganic evolution. The term \\norganic evolution states that all the various plants and animals existing at present time \\nhave descended from other generally the simpler organism by gradual modification \\nwhich have accumulated in successive generations. The major trend in the evolution \\nis been towards increased adaptation to some particular environment, and this has \\nfrequently involved increased specializations and complexity of structures and their \\nfunctions. \\nLife originated on earth millions of years ago and since then innumerable varieties \\nof living beings have evolved but this living matter cannot have existed all the time, \\non the earth. The high temperature and dry climate of the early time of earth would \\nhave made living matter impossible to exist. \\nThe origin of life on earth occurs in following three steps: \\n(A) ORIGIN OF UNIVERSE \\nMan has been speculating on the origin of the earth for thousands of years. Certain \\nelaborate hypothesis of earth origin have played a significant role in the development \\nof geologic theory regarding the origin of universe as well as earth. The various \\nhypothesis proposed are as follows: \\n1. The Nebular hypothesis - given by Immanuel Kant (1755) and Pierre Simon \\nde laplace (1796)18 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n2. The Planetesimal hypothesis - given by Thomas. C. Chamberlin and Forest. R. \\nMoulton (1895) \\n3. The Tidal hypothesis - James Jeans and Harold Leffires (1917) \\n4. Recent hypothesis \\n1. The Nebular Hypothesis \\nThe nebular hypothesis of Kant and Laplace is referred to as a star hypothesis. \\nThe hypothesis postulates that a greatly diffused spherical doud of gas a nebula, \\nextended outward at least to the present distance of the outer most planet. This cloud \\nrotated slowly as it cooled and contracted its velocity around the sun increased. The \\ngaseous mass gradually became a disk around the sun\\'s equator during this rotation, \\nrings of fiery gas were assumed to have been thrown off centrifugal force. Each ring \\nthan broke up and gathered into a sphere producing a planet which began to revolve \\naround the sun the same path as the former ring. The earth planet liquefied as it cooled, \\nthen with further cooling acquired a solid crust. The main body of the gas mean while \\ncondensed further to become the sun. \\nThe serious objections to the nebular hypothesis are: \\n1. The planets possess 98% of the rotational energy of the solClr system, whereas \\nthe sun has about 99.87% of the mass. \\n2. The heavy elements in the earth can originate only at temperatures for higher \\nthan those prevailing on the sun. \\n3. Some of the satellites revolve in a backward direction and one of them revolves \\nfaster than its planet rotates. \\n4. The mechanism of ring formation does not correspond to rotational velocity \\nof a solar nebula as postulated. \\n2. The Planetsimal Hypothesis \\nThe planetesimal hypothesis of Chamberlain and Moulton is referred to as a two \\nstar hypothesis. It explains the origin of the planets by a near collision between the \\nsun and another star which disrupted it. This hypothesis has many serious objections. \\n3. The Tidal Hypothesis \\nThis hypothesis proposed by James Jeans and Harrold Leffries (1917) proposed that \\nanother star closely approached the sun, producing tidal buldges from which steamed \\nan enormous cigar shaped filament of solar gases. This incandescent filament was put \\ninto revolution around the sun. It then broke into segments which contracted into rotating \\nspheres, the planets cooling from gas to liquid one of these planets, earth gradually \\nsolidified to its present condition. \\n4. Recent Hypothesis \\nWith the development of new mathematical technique and the discovery of newEVOLUTION OF MICROORGANISM 19 \\nfacts about the universe, various cosmogonist viz. Berlage (1940), Whipple (1947) and \\nHoyle (1950) has proposed new hypothesis. The general trend is toward a modified \\nversion of the ancient nebular hypothesis. \\nAccording to nebular hypothesis about 10-20 bi11ion yrs ago, cosmos was in the \\nform of a small sphere of highly condensed mass of cosmic material, with a big bang \\nit exploded into numerous pieces called nebulae. Our solar system originated from one \\nof these nebulae. The nebula was a cold and spinning cloudy mass· of cosmic dust or \\ngases. The central mass of nebula condensed to form a primitive sun. As it condensed, \\nthe sun became hotter and brighter due to the conversion of gravitational energy into \\nheat. Higher temperature initiated thermonuclear reaction in the sun which then started \\nemitting solar radiation. \\nBecause of rotational movement of nebula, a ring of cloud got separated, spinning \\naround the central mass and condensed into planets including our earth. As the earth \\nwas formed by the condensation of nebular mass, its temperature increased due to \\ninternal pressure, gravitation and effect of solar heating. \\nThus initially the earth was a fiery spinning ball of hot gases and vapours of various \\nelements. Through hundreds, millions years, the gases condensed into a molten core \\nand different elements got stratified according to their density. The heavy elements like \\niron and nickel etc. sank to the centre and formed solid core of the earth, the lighter \\nelements like silicon and aluminum rose to the surface and solidified to form the surface \\nor crust. The part of the earth between core and crust formed mantle which is solid \\nand m~de up of iron, magnesium and silicates. \\nThe lightest ones like He, H, °2, N2 and C flowed out of the surface and formed \\nthe gaseous atmosphere. \\nThe Primitive Atmosphere of Earth \\nThe original temperature of earth was supposed to be 900°C initially. This \\ntemperature was such high that the elements like H 2, N2, °2, and C could not exist \\nin free state. These gases combined variously either among themselves or with metals \\nforming oxides, carbides and nitrides. Thus carbon formed dicarbon, cyanogens, \\nmethane, CO 2, CO and metal carbides. Nitrogen formed nitrides with metals, oxygen \\nformed oxides and H2 combined with 02 to form water, with N2 to form ammonia, \\nmethane and carbon cyanamide with carbon. \\nInitially the temperature was too high that all these compound existed in gaseous \\nstate and water as superheated steam. These formed the atmosphere of primitive earth. \\nThis atmosphere of primitive earth was unlike our present atmosphere in following \\nrespects: \\n1. Abundance of H2 : The interstellar dust from which earth originated was \\nespecially rich in H 2. It readily combined with N2 forming ammonia, with 02 to form \\nwater and methane with carbo~ The primitive earth atmosphere was highly reducing. \\n2. Absence of 02 : The atmosphere of primitive earth was non-oxygenic. The free \\noxygen was bound in water, CO, and CO 2 and in metallic oxides on the surface rocks \\nand particles. Because of the absence of free 02 and complex organic compound that \\narose during early time were not subjected to degradation.20 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n3. Absence of ozone layer: There was no layer of ozone to absorb UV rays coming \\non earth from sun. \\nLater the earth cooled gradually, some of the atmospheric gas liquefied, and some \\nof the liquid turned solid. Steam condensed into water and resulted into rain. The rain \\ndroplets on approaching the super heated earth crust immediately evaporated and \\nreturned into the atmosphere. This cycle contin:ued for millions of years and resulted \\nin the cooling of earth surface. As a result the earth surface became cool enough to \\nhold water and large water bodies/first oceans come into existence. About 3 billion \\nyrs ago the earth had a solid crust, frequently punctured by eruptions of molten rocks \\n(Volcanoes) and at places filled with hot boiling sea water. The sea water contained \\ndissolved NH3\\' methane, some minerals and salts. The primitive atmosphere of the earth \\nwas devoid of free oxygen but rich in NH 3, CH 4 and hydrogen as found in the present \\natmosphere of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. \\nThe energy for synthetic processes that occurred on primitive earth in past during \\nchemical evolution was obtained from the following sources: \\n(a) Solar radiation or UV radiation from sun formed the most abundant type of \\nfree energy available on primitive earth. \\n(b) Viol~nt electric discharge followed with lightening and thunder from clouds \\nreached the primitive earth and contributed Significantly to form various micro \\nand macro-molecules. \\n(c) Volcano eruptions produced heat which also encouraged chemical reactions. \\n(d) Ionizing radiations and cosmic rays i.e. x - rays etc also provided energy for \\nchemical evolution. \\n(B) CHEMICAL ORIGIN OF LIFE (CHEMOGENY) \\nLife did not originate at one specific spot at one specific time in the early oceans \\nof earth. Oparin suggested that from these simple compound viz. (H20, CH 4, NH 3, \\nNitrogen formed nitrides, oxides, dicarbon, CO 2 and CO) more and more complex \\norganic compounds were formed gradually under the influence of electric charges, UV \\nrays or corpuscular radiations. \\nStep-l : Origin of organic compounds. \\nStep-2 : Formation of macromolecules or complex organic molecules by the process \\nof pofymerization and condensation. \\nStep-3 : Formation of nucleic acids \\nStep-4 : Formation of nucleoproteins or protobionts. \\nStep-l : Origin of organic compounds \\nI. Formation of II. Formation of \\nhydrocarbon oxy and hydroxy \\nderivative of \\nhydrocarbon \\nIII. Formation of \\ncarbohydrate \\nIV. Formation of V. Formation of \\nfatty acids and amino acids \\nglycerolEVOLUTION OF MICROORGANISM 21 \\nI. Formation of Hydrocarbons (Micro Molecules): When the temperature of earth \\ncooled down to l,OOOoC or even lower a variety of simple hydrocarbons (saturated/ \\nunsaturated) were formed presumably by the following methods: \\nThe combination of highly reactive free radicals CH and CH 2 \\nCH + CH ~ HC = CH Acetylene \\nCH 2 + CH 2 ~ H 2C = CH 2 Ethylene \\nCH 2 + CH 2 ~ CH 4 + C Methane \\n2CH 4 ~ HC = CH +3H 2 Acetylene \\nThe metal carbides reacted with steam \\nCaC 2 + H 20 ~ HC = CH + CaO \\n3Fe4C S + 16H 20 ~ C 1sH 32 + 4Fe30 4 \\nII. Formation of oxy and hydroxyl derivative of hydrocarbons: Both saturated as \\nwell as unsaturated hydrocarbons reacted with superheated steam and formed oxy and \\nhydroxyl-derivatives such as aldehyde, ketone and acids. \\nHC = CH + H 20 ~ CH 3CHO \\nCarbon monoxide reacted with water forming formic acid. Because of its reactivity \\ncarbon monoxide is considered to have participated in the formation of prebiotic \\ncompounds. \\nCO + H 20 ~ HCOOH \\nIII. Formation of carbohydrate: Small chain compounds of C, H, ° were also \\nformed from hydroxy derivatives. The first formed carbohydrate compound must have \\nbeen glucose and fructose. They condensed to form disaccharide and polysaccharide \\nlike sugars and starch. \\nIV. Formation of fatty acid and glycerol: The condensation and polymerization \\nof aldehyde and ketones and their oxidation resulted in the formation of fatty acids. \\nThese compounds had lesser percentage of oxygen and long straight chains of carbon. \\nIn the early oceans these glycerol and fatty acids might have combined to form fats. \\nV. Formation of NH2 acids: Combination of hydrocarbon, ammonia and water \\nunder the influence of freely available energy reacted to form amino compounds the \\namino acids. \\nThus after the synthesis of carbohydrate, fats and amino acids and other complex \\norganic substances probably occurred in sea, which according to Haldane is described \\nas \\'Hot dilute Soup\\'. The early ocean is considered to have been a primordial soup \\nthat contained all these building blocks of life. Life did not originate at one specific \\nspot at one specific time in the early oceans of earth life originated again and again \\nwherever necessary precursor accumulated. \\nSlep-2 Formation of macromolecular or complex organic molecules by polymerisation \\nand condensation \\nIn the hot dilute soup the molecules of simple organic substances came together22 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nin increasing number, collided, reacted and aggregated to form new molecules of \\nincreasing size and complexity resulting in the formati9n of more and more complex \\norganic compounds like polysaccharide, fats, proteins, purines, pyrimidines, nucleosides \\nand nucleotides. The process is called Polymerisation. Sugar molecules combined to form \\npolysaccharide like starch, cellulose and glycogen. The fatty acid and glycerol combine \\nto form fats. A large number of amino acid molecule combined to form long polypeptide \\nchains. Some of these polypeptide acted as primitive enzymes and speeded up the rate \\nof formation of specific molecules. \\nThe presence of appropriate organic monomers and polymers is the first step in \\nthe origin of life. The interaction between molecules due to hydrogen bonding, ionization \\nsolubility, surface tension etc. resulted in different orientation of molecules. Membranous \\nvesicles formed of lipids, polypeptides or other molecules can be produced by mechanical \\nagitation or spontaneously. These membranous vesicles represented an important step \\nin the origin of life because scientists were able to produce such simple structures in \\nthe laboratory viz. Coacervates and microspheres. \\n(a) Coacervates : Oparin and Fox found that large organic molecules synthesized \\nabiotically on primitive earth formed large colloidal aggregates due to intermolecular \\nattraction. These colloidal particles separate out of the solution into droplets called \\ncoacervates. Complex coacervates are made up of colloidal solution having more than \\none type of macromolecules. \\nWhen solutions of oppositely charged colloids are mixed coacervates droplets are \\nformed. They have much higher concentration of organic polymers than in aqueous \\nphase. \\nFig. 1 : Coacervate \\nThe Coacervates contain following characteristics \\n~ They are large enough to be seen under microscope. \\n~ They have very simple organisation. \\n~ They are mostly unstable, but some can stay for longer period. \\n~ They can increase in size by selectively absorbing proteins and other organic \\nmaterial.EVOLUTION OF MICROORGANISM 23 \\n-¢- They can divide by budding. \\n-¢- They can carry out functions like synthesis and hydrolysis of starch and \\npolynucleotides with the help of enzymes. \\nAlong with these characteristic the coacervate also present as poor model for \\nprotocells because : \\n-¢- They are formed from the mixture of contemporary bioproteins and not from \\nthe proteins that existed in past. \\n-¢- They are unstable and disintegrate with time. \\n(b) Microspheres : Fox found that when thermally produced protenoid were boiled \\nin water and allowed to cool, small spherical aggregates of protenoid are formed. These \\nare called microspheres. They have following characteristics: \\n-¢- They are easily formed when water is added to thermal proteinoids. \\n-¢- Show great uniformity in size and shape. \\n-¢- They resemble coccoid bacteria and generally form chains of varying length. \\n-¢- Generally stable. \\n-¢- E.M. of proteinoid microsphere reveal double layered boundary corresponding \\nto cell membranE\\' \\n-¢- They exhibit nonrandom motility. \\n-¢- They retain enzyme like activities of proteinoids. \\n-¢- They divide either by binary fission or by budding. \\nOn these basis it is assumed that microsphere like aggregates could have been the \\nfore runners of first living organism. Thus they provide an excellent model for protocells \\nbecause: \\n-¢- Microsphere originated from protenoid produced under conditions existing on \\nthe primitive earth. \\n-¢- They show structural and functional attributes of contemporary cells. \\nStep-3 : Formation of Nucleic Acids \\nThe next step was formation of nucleic acids by the polymerization of nucleotides. \\nThese self-replicating polynucIeotides (N. Acid) got established in the primordial earth \\nabout 3.5 billion yrs ago. Due to errors during replication different varieties of nucleic \\nacids were formed. These molecules with different nucleotides sequences competed for \\nthe available nucleotides precursor for self duplication. \\nCertain polynucleotides developed the quality of directing synthesis of polypeptides. \\nIt is suggested that RNA was the first carrier of genetic information. This shows that \\nthe genetic code and translation of nucleotide sequences into - NH2 acid sequences was \\nestablished at a very early stage of organic evolution. The nucleic acids were like naked \\ngenes and their formation was the first step to enter the vaguely defined frontiers \\nbetween life and non-life.24 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nStep-4 : Formation of Nucleoproteins or Protobionts : \\nDue to aggregation, giant molecules of nucleoproteins were formed by the union \\nof nucleic acid and basic protein molecules. \\nProtoribosomes : They were nucleoprotenoid particles with fiberous or globular \\nappearance. The globular nucleoprotenoid microparticles might have been early ribosomes \\nand called protoribosome. \\nProtoviruses : Some giant nucleoprotenoid molecules had certain characteristic of \\na free living gene. They were called protoviruses or protobionts by Oparin. \\nThe coacervate underwent some chemical reactions which produced special proteins \\nor enzymes. This led to self-replication of compounds, those possessing this property \\nmight be regarded as Freegene. Such a structure is comparable with the free living virus \\nand is supposed to be, formed of nucleoproteins. Self replication and mutations of a \\ngene lead to the formation of gene aggregates. These gene aggregates may be regarded \\nas independently existing chromosomes. The smallest bacteria represent such a stage \\nin its evolution. \\nFurther mutation lead to accumulation of metabolites around the chromosome. The \\ncomplex so formed represent the exposed nucleus. The cytoplasm might have been \\nacquired but not separated from the nuclear material as in blue green algae or in large \\nbacteria. Finally mutations led to the formation of typical cell with nuclear membrane. \\n(C) BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OR BIOGENY \\nThere are two hypothesis regarding the origin of primitive prokaryotic cell: \\n(a) Horowitz (1945) and Orgel (1973) proposed that nucleoprotein molecules formed \\naggregates in the hot soup of primitive sea. These got surrounded by nutrient shells \\nand limiting membrane and formed the first living cell. \\n(b) Oparin suggested that various macromolecules aggregated in the hot dilute soup \\nto form coacervates which got isolated from the surrounding by the formation of \\npolarized membrane of phospholipids. The coacervate with nucleoproteins developed \\ninto first living cells or protobionts. These first cells were similar to present day \\nmycoplasma and viruses. After some later stage in the evolutionary process. DNA took \\nthe place of a repository of genetic information. These protobionts most probably gave \\nrise to monera (cell without well defined nucleus) and Protista (cells with a distinct \\nnucleus). The monera and protista gave rise to Prokaryote and eukaryote respectively. \\nMonera developed into bacteria and cyanobacteria whereas Protista gave rise to \\neukaryote or that developed into Protozoa and Metaphyta. \\nThe fossilized remains of prokaryotic cells are around 3.5 to 3.8 billion years old \\nand have been discovered in stromatolites and sedimentary rocks and microbial fossil \\nare clearly present in rocks as old as 2 billion years. The stromatolites are layered or \\nstratified rocks often domed and are formed by incorporation of mineral sediments into \\nmicrobial mats. Thus prokaryotic cells or life arose very shortly after the earth cooled. \\nVery likely these early prokaryotes were anaerobic. The fossils of such primitive \\nprotobionts have been obtained from rocks in Africa about 3 billion yrs old. These wereEVOLUTION OF MICROORGANISM 25 \\nnamed Eobacterium isola tum. The modern stromatolites are layered or stratified rocks \\nformed by incorporation of calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate and Qther minerals into \\nmicrobial mats. \\nMicrospheres \\n~~ \\n4~; \\nGene like small nucleotide chains \\n(.1..1..1 \\n..... \\\\\\\\.~ \\n~~ \\n\\\\ \\nCoacervate \\ndrop \\n111,$ Nucleic acid molecules \\nn (Probably RNA) \\n~ ~ Virus Ike eobionlS \\nPrimitive \\nprokaryote \\n.. .. . \\n~ t·· --. ~ \\'. :\\':.

With rapid increase in the \\nnumber of chemoheterotroph, the nutrients from sea water began to disappear and \\ngradually exhausted. This lead to the evolution of other modes of nutrition like : \\n(a) Parasitism : This mode developed when some forms started living within the \\nbodies of living cells and obtained their food from them Example : Moneran, Viruses \\nand few protista are parasitic. \\n(b) Saprophytism : As the environment of primitive earth changed, some organism \\nstarted drawing their nourishment from the bodies of dead and decaying cell. \\n(c) Predation : The predators were the organism with animal like way of eating \\nwhere one organism eats another in whole or in part and obtains its food in this manner. \\n(d) Chemoautotrophs: Proto cells with enzymes of metabolic pathways could use \\nless complex nutrients and synthesized more complex molecules. They obtained energy \\nby fermentation. These early fermentative or anaerobic chemoautotrophs were similar \\nto our present day anaerobic bacteria and yeast. These anaerobic bacteria released large \\namount of CO z\\' Thus they were forerunners of photosynthetic cells. \\n(e) Chemosynthesisers : In the next step the evolution of chlorophyll molecule \\nenabled certain protocells to utilize light energy and synthetic carbohydrate. They were \\nphotosynthetic cells. The first photosynthetic cells were anaerobic, Example, the organism \\nsimilar to present day sulphur bacteria. This was the beginning of autotrophism where \\nthe HzS was cleaved into H2 and S where Hz was used in the synthesis of organic \\ncompound and sulphur released as waste product. These organism generate the energy \\nreleased by anaerobic respiration or fermentation and were called chemosynthesisers. \\n(f) Aerobic Photoautotroph : The last organism with most advanced type of \\nnutrition was Aerobic photoautotroph. It is presumed that accumulation of CO 2 in \\natmosphere and formation of chlorophyll molecule resulted in the evolution of autotrophic \\nforms. The first aerobic photoautotroph were cyanobacteria like forms which used water \\nas Hz source and CO 2 as the source of carbon in photosynthesis. They were called \\noxygen producing phototsynthesisers because of release of free oxygen in the atmosphere \\nand are also called oxygen producing photosynthesisers. They appeared about 3.3 - 3.5 \\nmillion yrs ago. \\nWith the increase of photoautotroph, 0z was liberated in the sea and then into \\natmosphere. This free oxygen then reacted with CH 4 and NH3 present in the primitive \\nearth and transformed them into CO z and free N 2• These gradual events ultimately \\ntransformed this ancient reducing, 0z free atmosphere into modern oxidizing atmosphere \\nwith plenty of oxygen. The rising level of atmosphere oxygen led to the appearance \\nof first one called eukaryotic organism. \\n(D) COGNOGENY \\nThe protocells were prokaryotic and archaebacteria like. The eukaryotic cells have \\nevolved from the archaic prokaryotic cell either by symbiosis or by invagination.EVOLUTION OF MICROORGANISM 27 \\nAccording to Lynn Margulis, some anaerobic predator host cell engulfed primitive \\naerobic bacteria but did not digest them. The oxygen respiring bacteria established \\nthemselves permanently inside host cells and developed mutual association. These \\npredator host cells become the first eukaryotic cells. The predators that captured aerobic \\nbacteria developed as mitochondria while with blue green algae as chloroplast. This \\nhypothesis is supposed as endosymbiont hypothesis. \\nMargulis and other have assembled a considerable amount of indirect evidence \\nin support of this hypothesis like Mitochondria and chloroplast are similar to bacteria \\nand cyanobacteria, they both contain self replicating DNA, ribosomes are similar like \\nprokaryotic cell. The proponents of endosymbiotic hypothesis suggest that endosymbionts \\nmust have transferred over time, some of their genes to the host nucleus and thus \\nrelinquished their independence for the sake of symbiotic relationship \\nAccording to other view the organelles of eukaryotic cells might have evolved by \\ninvagination of surface membrane of primitive prokaryotic celIs. The archaebacteria are \\nsaid to be the oldest of the \\'living fossils\\' that had separated from the main moneran \\nline (bacterial evolution) long ago. Regardless of the exact mechanism involved, the \\nemergence of eukaryotic cell led to dramatic increase in the complexity and diversity \\nof life on earth. At first organism were capable of existing only as independent single \\ncelIs. Later some evolved into multicellular organism in which various celIs became \\nspecialized for many different functions. The multiceIIular forms became adapted to life \\nin a great variety of environments. \\n000CLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM \\nA classification system based on the scheme of assigning individuals to group and \\nassigning these to progressively more inclusive and broader groups is called a hierarchial \\nscheme of classification. The formal system of organizing, classifying and naming living \\nthings is called taxonomy (Gr. Taxis = arrangement + nomas = name). The primary \\ngoals of taxonomy are classification, nomenclature and identification. These three areas \\nare interrelated and play a vital role in keeping a dynamic inventory of the extensive \\narray of living things. Once the characteristics of microorganism is determined and \\nappropriately catalogued the process of classification begins. The orderly arrangement \\nof organisms into group according to evolutionary relationship is termed as classification. \\nNomenclature is the process of assigning names to the various taxonomic ranking of \\neach microbial species. The process of discovering and recording the distinguishing \\nfeatures of organism is called identification. \\nTaxonomy has fascinated humans for a long time. The two Greek philosophers \\nHippocrates (460-377 B.C.) and Aristotle (384-322 B.c.) made the first recorded attempt \\nto classify all living things in the 384-322 B.C. the 4th century B.C., but their classification \\nwere not based on scientific methods. Later, after 2000 yrs in the eighteen century (1735), \\na Swedish biologist named Carolus Linnaeus devised a widely accepted scheme and \\nhe also laid down the basic rules for taxonomic categories or taxa and gave the bionomial \\nsystem of nomenclature i.e. naming of an organism by two names- genus and species. \\nThe name of the organism starts with the generic (Genus) name that is always capitalized, \\nwhich is followed by the species name that begins with small letter. Both names should \\nbe written in italics or underlined if italics are not available ex . Eschericia coli. The source \\nof nomenclature is usually latin or greek.Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1788) was a Swedish \\nnaturalist, called as \\'Father of Taxonomy\\' classified the organisms according to his own \\nsystem of classification (Binomial system). He wrote, \\'Systema Naturae\\', \\'GeneraCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 29 \\nPlantarum\\' and \\'Classes Plantarum\\' and Philosophia Botanica. According to him existing \\nspecies of plants and animals were the descendents of the previous created species. A \\nnumber of species have been named in honour of a scientist who originally discovered \\nthe microbe or who had made outstanding contribution to the field. For example E.coli, \\nthe generic name Escherichia is named after Theodor Escherich, a german bacteriologist \\nwho first described the bacterium, and specific name coli refers to the colon which is \\nappropriate because this organism is an enteric resident of humans. \\nThe Linnean scheme remains the basis for biological classification today which \\nprovides each organism with a unique name and Theophrastus (370-285 B.c.) a disciple \\nof Aristotle classified the plants on the basis of texture and is known as father of Botany. \\nHis book \\'Historia Plantarum\" deals with 480 plants. In the 1Th century two European \\nscientist John Ray (1627-1706) and Francis Willougby (1635-1672) collected many plants \\nand animals and classified them. John Ray described 18,000 plants and published a book \\n\\'Historia Generalis Plantarum\" in three volumes. \\nDomain Bacteria \\nI \\n\\'I \\nProteobacteria \\nI \\nPhylum \\nClass ot-Proteobacteria J3-Proteobacteria y-Proteobacteria II-Proteobacteria I:-Proteobacteria \\nI I I \\nOrder Chromatiales Thiotrichales Legionellales Pseudomonadales Vibrionales Enterobacteriales Pasteurellales \\nI \\nFamily \\nI \\nEnterobacteriaceae \\nI \\nGenus Enterobacter EscherichIa Klebsiella Proteus Salmonella Serratia Shigella Yersinia \\nI \\nI \\nI I I \\nSpecies S. boydii S. dysenteriae S. flexneri S. sonnei \\nFig. 1 : Hierarchical arrangement in taxonomy \\nHIERARCHICAL ARRANGEMENT IN TAXONOMY \\nThe basic taxonomic group in microbial taxonomy is the species whereas species \\nof higher organism are groups of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding natural \\npopulations that are reproductively isolated from other groups. A prokaryotic species \\nis a collection of strains that share many stable properties and differ significantly from \\nother groups of strains. According to some bacterial taxonomist. A species (genomospecies) \\nis a collection of strains that have a similar G + C composition and 70% or greater \\nsimilarity as judged by DNA hybridization experiments. \\nA strain is a population of organisms that is distinguishable from at least some \\nother populations within a particular taxonomic category. Strains within a species differ \\nslightly from one another.30 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nBiovars : These are variant prokaryotic strains characterized by biochemical or \\nphysiological differences. \\nMorphovars : These are prokaryotic strain which differ morphologically. \\nSerovars : These are prokaryotic strain which differ serologically or with different \\nantigenic properties. \\nOne strain of a species is designated as the type strain. It is usually one of the \\nfirst strain studied and often more fully characterized than other strains. Each species \\nis assigned to a genus, the next rank in the taxonomic hierarchy. A genus is a well \\ndefined group of one or more species that is clearly separate from other genera or a \\ngenus. Category containing a single series or a monophyletic group of species, which \\nis separated from other genera by a decided gap. The next rank in the taxonomic \\nclassification is family which is a taxonomic category containing one or more related \\ngenera and separated from other related families by important and characteristic \\ndifferences. Next group of taxonomic classification is order which may include super \\norders or suborders. Class is the subdivision of a phyla. A class is the basic category \\nof the class group which may include super class or infra class. The next category of \\ntaxonomic classification is phylum which is divided into super phylum or sub phylum. \\nThe kingdom is the highest taxonomic category. All animals are included in animal \\nkingdom and all plants are included in the plant kingdom. \\nThus in brief the main taxa or groups in a classification scheme are organized in \\nseveral ascending ranks beginning with : \\nSpecies : It is a group of related isolates or strains. \\nGenus : It is a collection of related species. \\nFamily: A collection of similar genera. In prokaryotic nomenclature, the name of \\nthe family ends in the suffix-aceae. \\nOrder : A collection of similar families. In prokaryotic nomenclature the name of \\nthe family ends in the suffix-ales. \\nClass : It is a collection of similar orders. In prokaryotic nomenclature the name \\nof the family ends in the suffix-ia. \\nPhylum or Division : A collection of similar classes. \\nKingdom: A collection of similar phyla or division. The number of different \\nkingdom varies according to the classification system used. \\nDomain: A collection of similar kingdom. The domain is a relatively new taxonomic \\ncategory that reflects the characteristic of the cells that make up the organism. \\nAll individual members of a species must be very much alike. The highest \\ntaxon such as kingdoms, contain organisms that are quiet different from one \\nanother. \\nThe classification of microorganisms began in 1674 with the invention of light \\nmicroscope and today is a discipline based on increasingly complex criteria. The earliest \\nschemes assigned microorganisms to one or the other of the two major categories ofCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 31 \\nliving things plants and animals i.e two kingdom plantae and Animalia. In the nineteenth \\ncentury scientists began to realize that the assignments of certain members viz. Protozoa, \\nAlgae, Fungi and Bacteria into these two kingdom is very artificial for example: \\nmicroorganism are neither plants nor animals. Nearly every group has representatives \\nwith plant like properties and others with animal like properties. Thus the german \\nbiologist Ernst Haeckel in 1866 proposed a three kingdom concept-Plants, Animals and \\nmicroorganism (the Protista). He proposed that the bacteria, algae, fungi and protozoa \\nthat lacked tissue differentiation be removed from the plant and animal kingdoms and \\nbe separated into third kingdom called Protista. This scheme served biology well for \\nnearly 60 years. By the 1930\\'s there was reason to revise Haeckel\\'s classification scheme. \\nBy using the newly available election microscope, scientists discovered that there were \\ntwo types of cells-prokaryotic or eukaryotic. \\nBy the 1930s to 1959 several system of classification was proposed but the one \\nthat is most widely accepted was given by Robert H. Whittaker (1959), an American \\ntaxonomist of Cornell university. This system places all living things (except the viruses) \\ninto five kingdoms based on cellular organisation and nutritional patterns (i) the \\nprocaryotae or monera (ii) The protista (iii) The myceteae or fungi (iv) The plantae (v) \\nThe animalia (Table 1) \\nTABLE 1 \\nWhittaker Five Kingdom Concept \\nPro£e!!l: Plantae Animalia Protista Funs!

Animals \\nThe five kingdom system is not accepted by many biologist. A major problem is \\nits lack of distinction between archae and bacteria. The kingdom protista, Plantae and \\nfungi are ill defined. For example the brown algae are probably not closely related toCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 33 \\nplants even though the five kingdom system places them in the plantae. Because of \\nthese problems with five kingdom system, various alternative is the six kingdom system \\nwas the simplest option where the kingdom monera or prokaryote divided into two \\nkingdom viz. Eubacteria and Archaeobacteria. \\nCavalier Smith (1987, 1993) believes that differences in cellular structure and genetic \\norganization are exceptionally important in determining phylogeny. He used rRNA \\nsequences and other molecular data in developing his classification. He divided all \\norganism into two empires (Bacteria and Eukaryota). The empire bacteria contains two \\nkingdom the eubacteria and Archaeobacteria. The second empire the eukaryota contain \\nsix kingdom of eukaryotic organism viz. Archezoa, Protozoa, Plantae, Chromista, Fungi \\nand Animalia. The group Archezoa are primitive eukaryotic unicellular organism such \\nas Giardia with 70s ribosome and lack golgi apparatus, mitochondria, chloroplast and \\nperoxisomes. \\nThe kingdom chromista contain many photosynthetic organism that have their \\nchloroplast within the lumen of the rough E.R. rather than in the cytoplasmic matrix. \\nDiatom, brown algae, cryptomonads and oomycetes are all placed in the chrcmista. \\nHe acquire a completely new kind of information in the late ~960\\'s as scientists \\nbecame able to determine the sequences of monomers in macromolecules. This flow of \\nnew information has continued at an ever increasing rate. Sogin and his coworker do \\nnot cluster the eukaryotic into a few major divisions but consider them to be a single \\ndomain or empire composed of a collection of independently evolved lineages, By the \\n1970\\' s molecular biologists realized that prokaryotic consist of two different and \\nunrelated groups. They are as distantly related to each other as they are to eukaryotes. \\nTo accommodate this new information three microbiologists C. Woese, O. Kandler and \\nM.L. Wheelis introduced a new classification scheme in 1990. They proposed that all \\norganisms be divided into three major groups or super kingdoms called domains: the \\neukarya (containing all eukaryotes), the bacteria (containing most familiar prokaryotes), \\nand the Archaea (originally called archae bacteria and containing prokaryotes that live \\nmostly in extreme environments). \\nThe discovery of three cell types was based on the observations that ribosomes \\nare not the same in all cells. Ribosomes provide a method of comparing cells because \\nribosomes are present in all cells. Comparing the sequences of nucleotides in 16S rRNA \\nfrom different kinds of cells shows that there are three distinctly different cell groups: \\nthe eukaryotes and two different types of prokaryotes the bacteri~ and the archaea. \\nIn 1978 Carl R. Woese proposed elevating the three cell types to a level above \\nkingdom called domain. Woese believed that the archaea and the bacteria, although \\nsimilar in appearance, should form their own separate domains on the evolutionary tree. \\nIn this scheme, animals, plants, fungi and protests are the kingdoms in the domain \\neukarya. Organisms are classified by cell types in the three domain systems. \\nThe Domain Bacteria includes all of the pathogenic prokaryotes as well as many \\nof the nonpathogenic prokaryotes found in soil and water. The photoautotrophic \\nprokaryotes are also in this domain. The domain Archaea includes prokaryotes that do34 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nnot have peptidoglycan in their cell walls. They often live in extreme environments and \\ncarry out unusual metabolic processe~. Archaea include three major groups: \\n(i) The methanogens, strict anaerobes that produce methane (CH 4) from CO 2 and \\n~. \\n(ii) Extreme halophiles, which require high concentration of salt for survival. \\n(iii) Hyperthermophiles which normally grow in hot environment. \\nOriginally archae were thought to be the most primitive group, whereas bacteria \\nwere assumed to be more closely related to eukaryotes. However studies of rRNA \\nindicate that a universal ancestor split into three lineages. \\nIn sequencing the genome of a prokaryote called Thermotoga maritima microbiologist \\nKarene Nelson has discovered that this species has genes similar to members of both \\nthe domain bacteria and the domain Archaea. Her finding suggest that Thermotoga is \\none of the earliest cells arising before the bacteria and Archaea split apart. Thus \\nThermotoga is referred to as one of the /I deeply branching genera\" that is near the origin \\nor root of the evolutionary tree. Major differential features among bacteria, Archaea and \\nEukaryo are described in the Table (2). \\nTABLE 2 \\nMajor Differential Features Among Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya \\nCharacteristic \\nMorophological and Genetic \\nProkaryotic cell structure \\nDNA present in \\ncovalently closed \\nand circular form \\nBacteria \\nYes \\nYes \\nHistone protein present No \\nMembrane enclosed nucleus Absent \\nCell wall \\nMembrane lipids \\nRibosomes (mass) \\nInitiator (tRNA) \\nIntrons in most genes \\nOperons \\nCapping and poly A \\ntailing of mRNA \\nPlasmids \\nMuramic \\nacid present \\nEster linked \\n70S \\nFormymethionine \\nNo \\nYes \\nNo \\nYes \\nArchaea \\nYes \\nYes \\nYes \\nAbsent \\nMuramic acid \\nabsent \\nEther linked \\n70s \\nMethionine \\nNo \\nYes \\nNo \\nYes \\nEukarya \\nNo \\nNo \\nYes \\nPresent \\nMuramic \\nacid absent \\nEster linked \\n80s \\nMethionine \\nYes \\nNo \\nYes \\nRare \\nContd ...CLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 35 \\n...

In addition these characters are valuable because \\nstructural features depend on the expression of many genes, are usually genetically stable \\nand normally these do not vary greatly with environmental changes. Thus, morphological \\nsimilarity often is a good indication of phylogenetic relatedness. \\n2. Biochemical and Physiological characters : Many of the biochemical and \\nphysiological characters used to classify bacteria are based on conditions that support \\ngrowth. Do the bacteria grow aerobically, anaerobically or both? What incubation \\ntemperature is most favourable? Over what range of PH do they grow? Are they able \\nto withstand high osmotic strength? What end products and enzymes do they form? \\nCarbon sources that support growth are a particularly useful set of characters because \\nmost bacteria can use so many different carbon sources. In fact it\\'s possible to identify \\nmany species of bacteria just by the carbon sources they use. Modern technique make \\nthis a relatively easy task. A plastic plate with 96 depressions is prepared each containing \\na colourless form of a tetrazolium dye (an oxidation jreduction indicator that is colorless \\nwhen oxidized and colored when reduced) and a different carbon source. Then a \\nsuspension of bacterial cells is added. If the organism can use the carbon source, the \\ndye is reduced and becomes colored. The color pattern is read by a machine and results \\nare fed directly into a computer. In a few minutes the computer displays the name \\nof the bacterium. \\nCan trey use \\ncitric acid as their \\nsole carbon source? \\n~s \\nShigella: \\nProduces lysine \\ndecarboxylase \\nSalmonella : \\nGenerally \\nproduces H 2S \\nCan they \\nferment lactose ? \\nCan they use \\ncitric acid as their \\nsole carbon source? \\n~s \\nEscherichia Do they \\nproduce \\nacetion? \\nAs \\nCitrobacter Enterobacter \\nFig. 3 : Use of metabolic characteristics to identify selected genera of enteric bacteria \\nFermentation properties of bacteria are also useful characters. Thus biochemical \\ncharacters such as metabolic end products and the presence or absence of a particular \\nenzyme or pathway. \\n3. Cultural characters : These include the cultural requirements for multiplicationCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 39 \\n(e.g. nutrients, oxygen, temperature etc) and the way growth occurs in liquid media, \\nand particularly on solid media (e.g. colony form) \\n4. Serology : The other way to classify and identify bacteria is through serology \\n(the science that studies serum, the noncellular fraction of blood). Serum contains \\nantibodies (protein molecules made in response to infection). And these antibodies are \\nhighly specific, they target specific microbes. Thus antibodies can distinguish between \\nclosely related microorganisms and even between strains. Sera that inactivate particular \\nbacteria are called antisera. This antisera are used in a number of ways. For example, \\nthey can be used in slide agglulination test to identify particular species or strains. \\nFluorescent labelled antibodies prepared from antisera are also used in a similar but \\nmore sensitive procedure. \\n5. Phage typing: Bacteriophages, or phages (viruses that attack bacteria) can also \\nbe used to classify bacteria. The pattern of strains attacked by a set\\' of bacteriophages \\nis called phage typing. The diversity of bacterial strains that one bacteriophage will attack \\n(termed the host range) is quiet narrow. Only closely related bacterial strains are attacked \\nby the same phages, phage typing is usually restricted to classifying strains within \\nspecies. \\nIn phage typing, a thin layer of the bacterial strain to be tested is spread on the \\nsurface of an agar plate and small drops of suspensions of various phages are placed \\non the surface. If the bacteria are susceptible to the phages in one or more of the drops \\nthey will lyse, producing a clear zone in the lawn (confluent layer of bacterial growth) \\nthat forms. \\nStrains with identifical phage types are identical. Strains with similar phage types \\nare closely related. Because phage typing can identify specific strains of bacteria, it is \\nused to determine if a cluster of bacterial infection is caused by the same strain. \\n6. Fatty acid analysis (FAME) : Bacteria differ in the type and reative quantity \\nof fatty acids that makeup their membranes, thus the cellular fatty acids composition \\ncan be used as an identifying marker. In gram -ve bacteria the fatty acids are present \\nin both, the cytophlasmic and the outer membranes. Whereas in gram +ve bacteria \\n(lacking an outer membrane), the cytoplasmic membrane is the source of fatty acids. \\nTo analyse their fatty acid composition, bacterial cells are grown under standardised \\nconditions. After this the cells are chemically treated with sodium hydroxide and \\nmethanol to release the fatty acids and to convert those acids to their more volatile \\nmethy ester form (FAME = Fatty acid methyl ester). \\nThe resulting fatty acids, methylated esters can than be separated and analysed \\nusing gas chromatography. By comparing the pattern of peaks, or chromatogram, to \\nthose of known species and isolate can be identified. \\nGENOME COMPARISON \\nIn the 1960s taxonomists began to develop methods to examine greater portions \\nof the genome. Some of the most powerful approaches to taxonomy are through the \\nstudy of proteins and nucleic acids because these are either direct gene products or40 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nthe genes themselves. Comparisons of proteins and nucleic acids yield considerable \\ninformation about true relatedness. These molecular approaches have become increasingly, \\nimportant in prokaryotic taxonomy. \\nComparison of Protein \\nAmino acid sequences of proteins are direct reflections of mRNA sequences and \\ntherefore closely related to the structures of the genes coding for their synthesis. \\nComparisons of proteins of different microorganisms are very useful taxonomically. If \\nthe sequences of proteins with the same function are similar, the organisms possessing \\nthem are probably closely related. The sequences of cytochromes and other electron \\ntransport proteins, his tones, heat shock proteins, transcription and translation proteins \\nand a variety of metabolic enzymes have been used in taxonomic studies. The \\nelectrophoretic mobility of proteins is useful in studying relationships at the species and \\nsubspecies level. \\nThe physical kinetic and regulatory properties of enzymes have been employed \\nin taxonomic studies. Because enzyme behavior reflects NH2 acid sequences, which is \\nuseful in studying some microbial group and group specific patterns of regulation have \\nbeen found. \\nNucleic Acid Base Composition \\nThis technique proved useful for microbes. There genomes can be directly compared \\nand taxonomic similarity can be estimated in many ways. It is possibly the most simplest \\ntechnique to be used in the determination of DNA base composition. However, it can \\nbe determined chemically by hydrolyzing DNA sample and separating the free bases \\nwith HPLC, it can be determined more easily by physical methods which is most \\nfrequently used. DNA contains four purine and pyrimidine bases-Adenine (A), Guanine \\n(G), Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T). In double stranded DNA, A pairs with T and \\nG pairs with C. Thus (G + C) / (A + T) ratio or G + C content is the percent of \\nG + C in DNA, reflects the base sequence and varies with sequence changes as \\nfollows:-\\nG+C Mol % G + C = x 100 G+C+A+T \\nThe G + C content often is determined from the melting temperature (fm) of DNA. \\nIn DNA structure 3 hydrogen bonds join GC base pairs and two bonds connect AT \\nbase pairs. As a result the DNA with greater G + C content will have more hydrogen \\nbonds and its strands will separate only at higher temperatures that is it will have a \\nhigher melting point. DNA melting can be easily followed spectro photometrically \\nbecause the absorbance of 260 nm UV light by DNA increases during strand separation. \\nWhen a DNA sample is slowly heated, the absorbance increases as hydrogen bonds \\nare broken and reaches a plateau when all the DNA has become single stranded. The \\nmelting point of the rising curve gives the melting temperature, a direct measure of \\nthe G + C content. Since the density of DNA also increases linearly with G + C content, \\nthe percent G + C can be obtained by centrifuging DNA in a Caesium chloride densityCLASSIFICA nON OF MICROORGANISM 41 \\ngradient. This method can be used because the density of DNA is also a function of \\n(G + C): (A + T) ratio. \\nThe G + C content of the nuclear DNA of major groups of organism has been \\nstudied. In both plants and animals the ranges are relatively narrow and quiet similar, \\naverges around 40% and ranges between 30 -50%. However in prokaryotic microorganism \\nthe G + C content is highly variable ranging from around 25 to almost 80%. For example, \\nvarious Streptococci, Pneumococci and Lactobacilli have a similar value (38-40%) which \\nhave been traditionally grouped together as lactic acid bacteria (because of their \\ncharacteristic fermentation). The G + C content of strains within a particular species \\nis constant. If two organisms differ in their G + C content by more than about 10%, \\ntheir genomes have quite different base sequences. \\nTaxonomically these G + C data are valuable for at least two reasons: \\n-¢- They can confirm a taxonomic scheme developed using other data. If organisms \\nin the same taxon are too dissimilar, in G + C content the taxon probably should \\nbe divided. \\n-¢- The G + C content appears to be useful in characterizing prokaryotic genera \\nsince the variation within a genus is usually less than 10% even though the \\ncontent may vary greatly between genera. For example Staphylococcus has a \\nG + C content of 30 - 38% whereas MicroccocllS DNA has 64 to 75% G + C, \\nyet these two genera of gram positive cocci have many other features in \\ncommon. \\nNucleic Acid Hybridization \\nThe similarity between genomes can be compared more directly by use of nucleic \\nacid hybridization studies. This includes DNA-DNA homology or DNA base sequence \\nand RNA sequences. If a mixture of single stranded DNA (formed by heating of ds \\nDNA) is cooled and held at a temperature about 25°C below the Tm, strands with \\ncomplementary base sequences will reassociate to form stable dsDNA, and the non \\ncomplementary strands will remain single. Incubation at 10-15°C below the Tm permits \\nhybrid formation day with almost identical strands. \\nThe most widely used hybridization techniques include nitro-cellulose filters which \\nbounds nonradioactive DNA strands are incubated at the appropriate temperature with \\nsingle stranded DNA fragments made radioactive with 32P, 3H or 14C. After radioactive \\nfragments are allowed to hybridize with the membrane bounds single stranded DNA, \\nthe membrane is washed to remove any non hybridized single stranded DNA and its \\nradioactivity is measured. The quantity of radioactivity bound to the filter reflects the \\namount of hybridization and thus the similarity of the DNA sequences. The degree of \\nhomology is expressed as the percent of experimental DNA radioactivity retained on \\nthe filter compared with the percent of homologue DNA radioactivity bound under the \\nsame conditions. Two strains whose DNA\\'s show at least 70% relatedness under optimal \\nhybridization conditions and less than a 5% difference in Tm is often considered as \\nmembers of the same species. However DNA preparation from two unrelated bacteria, \\ncould not hybridise or they will not form a stable detectable hybrid. Therefore DNA-42 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nDNA hybridization is used to study only closely related microorganism and the more \\ndistantly related organisms are compared by carrying out DNA- RNA hybridization \\nexperiments or by forming duplex between single stranded DNA and complementary \\nRNA strands. It includes the experiments carrying out using radioactive ribosomal or \\ntRNA. Distant relationships can be detected because rRNA and tRNA genes represent \\nonly a small portion of the total DNA genome and have not evolved as rapidly as most \\nother microbial genes. The RNA molecules are highly conserved in an evolutionary \\nsense and provide a very useful measure of the phylogenetic relationships of the \\nwider groupings of microorganisms. The choosen molecules are 16 5rRNA and \\n55rRNA. Although this technique of nucleic acid hybridization have not yet \\nprovided a phylogenetic bacterial taxonomy to replace the classical Bergey\\'s determinative \\nkey. \\n1.5 \\nE 1.4 t: \\ng \\nC\\\\I \\n«i B 1.3 \\nt: \\n.e E 1.2 \\nell \\nQ) \\n.<!! \\n«i \\n(j) 1.1 a: \\n,i\"C. \\n\"ll\" II \\nFig. 4 : A DNA melting curve \\nNUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCING \\nThe sequence of bases in DNA determines an organism\\'s genetic plan. Thus on \\nidentical sequence means identical organisms and a similar sequence means closely related \\norganisms, comparing DNA base sequences is the ultimate tool of taxonomy. The \\nsubstantial length of DNA sequence can be measured by Maxam and Gilbert method \\nor measured sequenced by 5angers. By the advancement of technology it is now possible \\nby sequencing both DNA and RNA. By far RNA sequencing has been used more \\nextensively in microbial taxonomy and the most attention is given to sequences of 55 \\nand 165rRNA\\'s isolated from 50 5 and 305 subunits respectively of prokaryotic ribosomes. \\nThe rRNA are almost ideal for studies of microbial evolution and relatedness since itCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 43 \\nis essential to a critical organelle found in all microorganisms. Their functional role is \\nsame in all ribosomes. Furthermore their structure changes very slowly with time. \\nBecause the structure of ribosome cannot tolerate much change and still remain \\nfunctional, rRNA is highly conserved. Thus the rRNA of even distantly related organisms \\nis similar enough that we can not count their number of differences and thus calculate \\nthe evolutionary distance between them. The sequencing of SSrRNA from different \\norganisms to determine relatedness between organisms is based on the assumption that \\nthe molecule in all organisms have a common origin: they were originally identical as \\none species evolves into another the DNA sequences encoding rRNA change but the \\nrRNA continues to serve the same function. The similarity of DNA sequences encoding \\na molecule such as 5SU rRNA is therefore a direct measure of the relatedness of the \\norganisms that produced those molecule. Conversely the number of differences in their \\nDNA sequences is a measure of evolutionary distance between a pair of organisms. \\nOrganism A DNA \\n11\"\"\\'11 \\n,.... i I~ \\n(4) Determine degree \\nof hybridisation \\n:1111111\" \\nComplete hybridisation \\n(Identical) \\nOrganism B DNA \\n:1 I , , , I , I] \\n, \\'--c.. \\n(2) Combine single strands of DNA \\n(3) Cool to allow renaturation of ds DNA \\n::I ~ 1\"\\'\"\" Iii , i \\\\-\"\\' \\n_\"\\'~ \\nPartial hybridisation ~N b \\'d\\' .

The studies on the sequences of bases \\nin rRNA first revealed that the archaea are a separate major biological group. \\nA complete rRNA can be sequenced using several different procedures. In one \\napproach, RNA is first isolated, purified. Then reverse transcriptase is used to make \\ncomplementary DNA (cDNA) using primers that are complementary to conserved rRNA \\nsequences. Next the PCR amplifies the cDNA. Finally the cDNA is sequenced and the \\nrRNA sequence deduced from the results. Nowadays is used to amplify the 165 rRNA44 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nfrom the bacterial genome. The amplified rRNA then sequenced either manually or by \\nan auto mated sequence using the Sanger method. \\nThe relatedness of organisms can be determined by comparing the sequences of \\nbases in genes that encodes proteins. It is possible because every organism has a few \\nproteins that serve the same function in all organisms. Sequencing the genes that encode \\nthese proteins gives information much like that gained from sequencing SSurRNA. \\nRNA FINGER PRINTING AND SEQUENCING \\nA number of tRNA and 5SrRNA have been sequenced but because they are small \\nmolecules the amount of information they contain is fairly low. More useful for \\ntaxonomic purposes are sequences of larger molecules such as 16S or 18S rRNA. Carl \\nWoese was the first who initiated studies on the phylogeny of 16SRNA. He digested \\n16SRNA with a specific endonuclease producing a variety of short oligonucleotide which \\nwere separated and sequenced. It was the finding that the 16SrRNA sequences of \\nmethanogens halophiles and thermoacidophiles were unexpectedly divergent from those \\nof other bacteria that allowed the recognition of archaebacteria as a distinctive \\nassemblage of bacteria. \\nThe methods deviced by Woese is as follows: radioactive 16S rRNA (obtained by \\ngrowing organisms in the presence of phosphate containing the radioactive isotope 32p) \\nis purified and digested with the endonuclease T l\\' This endonuclease cleaves the RNA \\non the 3\\' side of every guanosine residue hence a mixfure of oligonucleotides is obtained \\nthat range in size from a single nucleotide to a dozen or more, all containing a single \\nguanosine residue at the 3\\' terminus. These are now separated by two dimensional \\nelectrophoresis (the mixture is electrophoresed in one dimension in one buffer system, \\nthen in a second dimension in another buffer system) and their position determined \\nby autoradiography. The labelled oligonucleotides can then be removed and sequenced. \\nPractically only those with a chain length of five residues or more contain sufficient \\ntaxonomic information to be worth cataloguing. Oligonucleotide catalogues of a number \\nof organism are analysed with the help computer program, which compares them in \\na pairwise fashion and result can be displayed as a dendrogram. \\nA detailed analysis of 16SrRNA oligonucleotide catalogues or complete sequences \\nreveals that there are both, quiet variable and highly conserved regions of the molecule, \\nreflecting different degrees of functional constraint on different parts of the molecule. \\nSeparate comparison of the variable and conserved regions allows determination of both \\nclose and distant relationship. In conserved regions there are sequences of that are \\ncharacteristic of major groups of bacteria, termed signature sequences. At great \\nphylogenetic distances these signature sequences are important in allowing the \\ndetermination of relationships. . \\nThe rapid technique to sequence long molecules of RNA has been devised and \\nnow used in preference to finger printing. To sequence a long molecule of rRNA, bulk \\nRNA is isolated from a culture (no need to purify) and a short RNA primer is added \\nthat is homologous to one of the conserved regions of rRNA. Dideoxy sequencing canCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 45 \\nthen be performed directly on the RNA template using the enzyme reverse transcriptase \\na viral enzyme that produces a DNA compliment to a RNA molecule. \\nIn prokaryotic ribosomes there are three different ribosomal RNAs i.e. 5S, 16S and \\n23S but only 16S sequence is used because nucleotides are neither less nor more in \\nlength and easy to sequence 1,500 nucleotides are present in 16SrRNA, the 5SrRNA \\ncontain only - 120 nucleotides that are too small to conclude any fruitful relationship, \\nwhereas 23S contains approximately - 2,900 nucleotides which are quiet high in number. \\nDNA SEQUENCING \\nEither of the two different procedures can be used to sequences substantial lengths \\nof DNA i.e. The Sanger method or the Maxam and Gilbert method. Although they differ \\nin chemical detail, both rest on the same basic principle; a series of DNA fragments \\nare generated which have a common starting point, but variable termini (\"nested\" \\nfragments); by determining their exact length and the terminal base, the sequence can \\nbe inferred with great accuracy. Sanger method can be explain with an example. \\nIn order to determine the sequence of bases in a segment of DNA, a large number \\nof identical copies of it must be obtained. If the molecule that contains the sequence \\nis relatively small (e.g. a viral genome or a plasmid), one can feasibly sequence the \\nentire molecule. In such a case one need only separate the molecule from contaminating \\nnucleic a~id (e.g. fragments of the bacterial chromosome). If the sequence is part of a \\nmuch larger molecule, such as the bacterial chromosome, the usual approach is to clone \\nthe desired segment, and sequence a restriction fragment purified from the cloned DNA. \\nSince the Sanger method uses single-stranded DNA, the segment must either be digested \\nwith a nuclease to convert it to single-stranded DNA or, preferably, cloned in a single\\xad\\nstranded vector to begin with (bacteriophage M13). \\nSequencing of a purified single-stranded fragment is accomplished by generating \\na series of complementary nested fragments of DNA by incubating the fragment with \\nDNA polymerase, a short primer sequence complementary to a region of the fragment \\n(often a short restriction fragment itself), the four deoxy nucleoside triphosphates (one \\nor more of which are radioactive), and a small amount of one dideoxy nucleoside \\ntriphosphate (e.g. dideoxythymidine triphosphate). Chance incorporation of \\ndideoxythymidine, which lacks a 3\\' -hydroxyl group, terminates polymerization at that \\npoint. Thus, after a suitable incubation period, the mixture will contain radioactive DNA \\nstrands of variable length, all of which terminate in a thymidine residue. The number \\nof classes of DNA molecules, differing from each other in length, depends on the number \\nof thymidine residues, since for every thymidine residue in the new strand, there will \\nbe a family of radioactive DNA molecules that terminates at that point. \\nIn practice four parallel incubations are performed, identical except that each \\ncontains a different dideoxy nucleoside triphosphate, and hence will terminate at a \\ndifferent base. The mixture is then denatured and electrophoresed to separate the newly \\nsynthesized strands by size. The position of the radioactive bands on the gel are \\nvisualized by appressing the gel tightly to a sheet of X-ray film, which is exposed by \\nthe localized decay of the radioisotope incorporated into the DNA. Upon development,46 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nthe film displays a series of exposed bands, each of which corresponds to a size class \\nof single-stranded DNA. The sequence can then be inferred directly from this \\nautoradiogram; the shortest fragment will be found in the incubation mixture that \\ncontains the dideoxy analogue of the first base after the primer; the next shortest \\nfragment will be found in the mixture that contains the dideoxy analogue of the second \\nbase after the primer, and so on for up to hundreds of bases. \\nDNA sequencing techniques were devised by molecular biologists and have been \\napplied primarily to genetic problems with dramatic success, but to date the application \\nof these techniques to taxonomic problems has been minimal. However, as the techniques \\nare more widely applied, and a rapidly expanding library of sequences begins to include \\na number of homologous sequences from different organisms, taxonomists will \\nundoubtedly come to depend increasingly on comparison of DNA base sequence to \\ndetermine organismic relationships. Indeed it is probably not unrealistic to anticipate \\nthat in the near future the complete base sequence for the genomes of a number of \\nmicroorganisms will be available, and microbial taxonomy may become an exact, \\nquantitative science. \\nMicrobial Phylogeny \\nAnalysis of oligonucleotide catalogues of 165 rRNA has allowed the recognition \\nthat the bacteria can be divided into several major groups based on the similarity of \\ntheir ribosomal RNA. The degree of sequence similarity of this molecule is a reflection \\nof the phylogenetic distance among organism. The rate of change of the sequence of \\ngenes encoding it is much less than that of the bulk of the genome, and it is possible \\nto determine relationship over vast evolutionary distances. The comparison of complete \\nsequences of eubacterial and archaebacterial 165 and eukaryotic 185rRNA shows that \\neven at the greatest phylogenetic distances among cellular organisms about 50% \\nhomology remains. This rRNA functions as a molecular clock, and allows accurate \\ndetermination of phylogenetic distance. Following are some ways in which phylogenetic \\nrelationship are assessed. \\nMolecular Chronometers \\nThe sequence of nucleic acids and proteins change with time and are considered \\nto be molecular chronometers. This term was first suggested by Zucketkandl and Pauling \\n(1965), is important in the use of molecular sequences in determining phylogenetic \\nrelationship. It is assumed that there is an evolutionary clock where the sequences of \\nmany rRNA and protein gradually change over time without destroying or severely \\naltering their functions. In molecular chronometers it is assumed that such changes occur \\nfairly randomly, selectively neutral and increase linearly with time. When the sequence \\nof similar molecules are quiet different in two groups of organisms, the group diverged \\nfrom one another a long time ago. Using molecular chronometer for phylogenetic analysis \\nis complex because the rate of sequence change can vary because some period are \\nrecognized by especially rapid change. Along with this different molecules and various \\nparts of the same molecule can change at different rates. Highly conserved molecules \\nlike rRNA are used to follow large scale evolutionary changes while rapidly changing \\nmolecules are employed for speciation. Many scientist believes that these molecularCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 47 \\nchronometers especially protein clocks are not accurate and further studies are required \\nto establish their accuracy and usefulness. \\nGene \\n(a) \\n\\'\\\\ \\nVector \\n(b) \\n\\'\" \\nPrimer \\n(c) - ACGAATACGATCCATGCG \\n--T \\n\\'\\\\ \\nPrimer \\n(d) Mix 1: dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, ddATP \\n---TGCTTddA \\n-----TGCTT ATGCTddA \\n---TGCTTATGCTAGGTddA \\netc. \\nMix 2: dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, ddGTP \\n--TGddG \\n--TGCTTATGddG \\n----TGCTTATGCTAddC \\n-TGCTTATGCTAGGTACGddC \\netc. \\nMix 3: dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, ddGTP \\n--TddG \\n---TGCTTATddG \\n---TGCTTATGCTAddG \\n-----TGCTT ATGCTAGddG \\n--TGCTTATGCTAGGTACddG \\netc. \\nMix 4: dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, ddTTP \\n-----TGCddT \\n---TGCTddT \\n---TGCTTAddT \\n--TGCTTATGCddT \\n---TGCTTATGCTAGGddT \\netc. \\nFig. 6 : DNA sequencing by the Sanger method \\n(a) the single-stranded vector containing the cloned fragment to be sequenced (b) a \\npurified restriction fragment complementary to the 5\\'end of the gene is added as primer \\n(c) the sequence near the 5\\' end of the gene, showing the 5\\'end of the primer (d) the \\nprimed template is added to four different polymerization mixtures, each containing \\nDNA polymerase, the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and each a different \\ndideoxynucleoside triphosphate.

Each node \\nrepresent taxonomic units like species or genes. The external node those at the end of \\nthe branches represent living organism. The length of branches may represent the number \\nof molecular changes that takes place between the two nodes. Finally a tree can be rooted \\nor uprooted. The rooted tree gives a node that serves as the common ancestor and shows \\ndevelopment of the species from the root. It is a difficult task to develop a rooted tree. \\nIn contrast an unrooted tree simply represent a phylogenetic relationships but does not \\nprovide an evolutionary path. \\nThe Phylogenetic trees are developed by comparing molecular sequences. The first \\nstep to compare two molecules is to align there sequences so that similar parts match \\nup. The object is to align and compllre homologous sequences (once that are similar \\nbecause they had a common origin in the part). The computer plus complex mathematics \\nis employed to minimize the number of gaps and mismatches in the sequence is \\ncompared. \\nOnce the molecule is aligned the number of position that vary in the sequence \\ncan be determined and this data is used to calculate a measure of the differences between \\nthe sequences. The difference is expressed as the evolutionary distance. The evolutionary \\ndistance is a quantitative indication of the number of positions that differ between two \\naligned macromolecules. Statistical calculation is then made for back mutation and \\nmultiple substitution. In the next step the organism are then clustered together on the \\nbasis of similarity in the sequences. The most similar organism are then clustered together \\nand compared with the remaining organUim to form large duster associated together \\nat a lower level of similarity or evolutionary distance. This process is continued till all \\norganism are included in the tree. The another technique to estimate phylogenetic tree \\nis by parsimony analysis. Here the relationship are determined by estimating the \\nminimum number of sequence changes required to give the final sequences being \\ncompared. It is assumed that evolutionary changes occur along the shortest pathway \\nwith the fewest changes or steps from an ancestor to the organism in question. \\nrRNA, DNA AND PROTEIN AS INDICATORS OF PHYLOGENY \\nThe comparison of 165RNA isolated from various strains of prokaryote is of great \\nimportance in determining the phylogenetic relatedness then any other molecular \\ntechnique. The association coefficient or 5ab Value from rRNA studies is assumed to \\nbe a true measure of relatedness, the higher the 5ab value obtained from comparing \\ntwo organism, the more closely the organism are related to each other. If the sequence \\nof 165 rRNA of two organism are identical (5ab Value = 01). A group of prokaryote \\nthat branches off from other prokaryote long ago show a large range of 5ab value because \\nit has had more time to diversify than a group that developed more recently. Therefore \\nthe narrower the range of Sab value of a group of prokaryote the more modern it is. \\nAfter the determination of 5ab value the computer calculates the relatedness of the \\norganism and summarize its relationship in a tree or dendrogram. \\nThe 165rRNA of most major phylogenetic groups has one or more character sitesCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 49 \\nnucleotide sequence called oligonucleotide signature or oligonucleotide signature \\nsequences. These sequences are specific sequences which occur in most of all members \\nof a particular phylogenetic groups. They are rarely or never present in other groups \\neven of the closely related onces. Thus these sequences can be used to place the \\nmicroorganism in the proper group. These sequences has been identified for various \\norganism viz. bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and many other prokaryotic groups. \\nAlthough rRNA comparison are useful for the species level but DNA similarity \\nstudies are more effective in categorizing individual species and genera. These comparison \\ncan be carried out by using G + C content or hybridization studies. Like rRNA the \\nDNA composition of a cell does not change with growth conditions. The DNA \\ncompal\\'ison are based on complete genome rather than a fraction and precisely define \\na species based on 70% relatedness criteria. \\nCurrently many protein sequences are used to develop phylogenetic trees. This \\napproach has some advantages over rRNA comparisons. The sequence of 20 amino acids \\nhas more information persite than a sequences of four nucleotides. The protein sequences \\nare less affected by organism specific differences in G + C content than DNA and RNA \\nsequences and finally the protein sequence alignment is easier because it is not dependent \\non secondary structure as in an rRNA sequence. This approach involve some disadvantages \\nlike; indispensable protein with constant function do not change as rapidly whereas some \\nprotein like Ig evolve quiet rapidly. Thus all proteins are not suitable for studying large \\nscale change that occur over long periods. \\nSummary it is clear that sequences of all three macromolecules viz, rRNA, DNA \\nand proteins can provide valuable phylogenetic information but more molecular data \\nplus further study of phenotypic properties will help to resolve uncertainities. \\nNumerical Taxonomy: The earliest system of biological classification were based \\non arbitrarily chosen criteria and this classification was termed as artificial classification. \\nThe first such system of classification which was widely accepted was that given by \\nLinnaeus. Later when the fact of biological evolution was recognized another dimension \\nwas immediately added to the concept of natural or phentic classification. In the 19th \\ncentury the classification was based on the terms of evolutionary affinities and the \\ntaxonomic hierarchy in a certain sense become the reflection of a family tree and such \\na taxonomic system is called as phylogenetic system. \\nAn alternative approach for the classification is empirical one where the taxonomic \\narrangement is based on quantification of the similarities and differences among \\norganism. This was first suggested by a French biologist Michal Adansona and the \\nclassification is also named as Adansonian (or numerical) taxonomy. Here each \\nphenotypic character is given equal weighting, it should express numerically the \\ntaxonomic distances between organisms in terms of the number of characters they share, \\nrelative to the total number of characters examined. \\nThe process begins with a determination of the presence or absence of selected \\ncharacters in the group of organisms under study. Many characters at least 50 and \\npreferably several hundred should be compared for an accurate and reliable classification. \\nIt nlcludes many different kinds of data viz. morphological, biochemical and physiological.50 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nAfter character analysis, an association coefficient a function that measures the \\nagreement between characters possessed by two organism is calculated for each pair \\nof organisms in the group. The simple matching coefficient (Ssm) is the proportion of \\nthe characters that match regardless of the whether the attribute is present or absent. \\nSometimes the Jaccord coefficient (Sj) is calculated by ignoring any characters that \\nboth organism lack. Both coefficients increase linearly in value from 0.0 (no matches) \\nto 1.0 (100% matches). \\nSimple matching coefficient or other association coefficients are then arranged to \\nform a similarity matrix. This is a matrix in which the rows and columns represent \\norganisms and each value is an association coefficient measuring the similarity of two \\ndifferent organisms so that each organism is compared to every other one in the table. \\nOrganisms with great similarity are grouped together and separated from dissimilar \\norganisms. Such groups of organisms are called phenons (or phenoms). \\nthe results of numerical taxonomic analysis are often summarized with a tree like \\ndiagram called dendrogram. the x-axis or abscissa generated in units of similarity. Each \\nbranch point is at the similarity value relating the two branches. The organisms in the \\ntwo branches share so many characteristics that the two groups are seen to be separate \\nonly after examinations of association coefficient greater than the magnitude of the branch \\npoint value. Below the branch point the two groups appear to be one. A 70-phenon is \\na phenon with 70% or greater similarity among its constituents. Phenons formed at about \\n80% similarity often are equivalent to species. Numerical taxonomic methods also can \\nbe used to compare sequences of macromolecules such as RNA and proteins. \\nTABLE 4 \\nTaxonomic Criteria Used for Classification \\nand Identification of Bacteria \\nCriterion \\nMorphological characteristics \\nDifferential staining \\nBiochemical testing \\nSerology \\nPhage typing \\nAmino acid sequencing \\nProtein analysis \\nBase composition of nucleic acids \\nNucleic acid hybridization \\nFlow cytometry \\nNumerical taxonomy \\nYes \\nUsed for \\nClassification \\nNo (yes for \\ncyanobacteria) \\n(for cell wall type) \\nNo \\nYes \\nNo \\nYes \\nYes \\nYes \\nYes \\nNo \\nYes \\nIdentification \\nYes \\nYes \\nYes \\nYes \\nYes \\nNo \\nNo \\nNo \\nYes (DNA probes) \\nYes \\nNoCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 51 \\nPolyphasic Taxonomy \\nAs we come to know by previous paragraph that all phylogenetic results vary with \\ndata used in analysis, many taxonomist believe that all possible valid data should be \\nemployed in determining phylogeny, in the approach called polyphasic taxonomy, \\ntaxonomic schemes are developed using a wide range of phenotypic and genotypic \\ninformation ranging from molecular properties to ecological characteristics.

In 1923 David Bergey, professor of bacteriology at the \\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and four colleagues published a classification of bacteria that \\ncould be used for identification of bacterial species. The Bergey\\'s manual of determinative \\nbacteriology has been a widely used reference since publication of the first edition in \\n1923. This manual is now in its ninth edition edited in 1992. The manual does not classify \\nbacteria according to evolutionary relatedness but provides identification (determining) \\nschemes, based on such criteria as cell wall composition, morphology, differential \\nstaining, oxygen requirement and biochemical testing. In this volume bacteria are \\nassigned 19 parts based primarily on following fedtures like energy and carbon source, \\nmode of locomotion, morphology and gram stain reaction, gaseous requirement and \\nendospore formation ability. The edition was published by Wilkins and Baltimore \\ncompany of USA. \\nFrom 1984, the Bergey\\'s Manual was renamed Bergey\\'s Manual of systematic \\nBacteriology is being published in sepnate volumes. This manual includes 35 sections \\nbased on characters like general shape, morphology, gram staining, presence of \\nendospore, motility, oxygen relationships, mode of energy production. The manual \\ninclude four divisions of the kingdom Prokaryotae. The Gracilicutes (gram -ve cell wall) \\nFirmicutes (gram + ve cell wall other than actinomycetes), Tenericutes (bacteria lacking \\ncell wall uther than actinomycetes) and Mendoricutes (bacteria lacking peptidoglycan \\nin their cell wall like Archaebacteria).NOMENCLATURE AND BERGEY\\'S MANUAL 53 \\nGracilicutes (thin skin) \\n[Cell wall characteristics of gram-vel \\nClass \\nScotobacteria \\nEx.

As a consequence, the second \\nedition of Bergey\\'s manual is largely phylogenetic rather than phonetic and thus quiet \\ndifferent from the first edition and second edition is published in five volumes. It has \\nmore ecological information about individual taxa. The second edition does not group \\nall the clinically important prokaryotes together as the first edition, instead, pathogenic \\nsps will be placed phylogenetically and thus scattered throughout the following five \\nvolumes. \\nVol. 1 \\nVol. 2 \\nVol. 3 ,. \\nVol. 4 \\nVol. 5 A\\' \\nThe Archaea, and the deeply branching and phototrophic bacteria. \\nThe Proteobacteria \\nThe low G + C gram + ve bacteria \\nThe high G + C gram + ve bacteria \\nThe Planctomycetes, Spirochaetes, Fibrobacteres, Bacteroidetes and \\nFusobacteria.54 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nTABLE 1 \\nOrganization of Bergey\\'s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology \\nTaxonomic Rank \\nVolume 1.

Dictyoglomus \\nClass : Dictyoglomi \\nOrder : Dictyoglomiales \\nDictyoglomus \\nVolume 5 describes an assortment of nine phyla that are located here for more \\nconvenience. The inclusion of these groups in volume five does not simply that they \\nare directly related. All of them are gram -ve bacteria variable in morphology, physiology \\nand life cyt:le pattern. The four important phyla are briefly described: \\n1. Phylum : Planctomycetes (related to chlamydias according to rRNA sequences \\nit contain only one order (are coccoid to avoid or pear shaped that lack peptidoglycan, \\nnormally unicellular, divide by budding and may produce non prosthecate appendages \\ncalled stalks, grow in aquatic habitats.) Ex. - Isosphaera \\n2. Phylum: Chlamydiae (small phylum, obligate, intracellular parasite with unique \\nlife cycle involving two distinctive stages-elementary bodies and reticulate bodies, small \\ncoccid form with no appendages. Important pathogen and cause many human diseases). \\n3. Phylum Spirochaetes : (contain helically shaped, motile, gram - ve bacteria with \\nunique morphology and motility, chemoheterotroph, free living, symbiotic, parasitic. It \\nhas special exterior boundry the outer membrane that surrounds the protoplasmic \\ncylinder. Several important human pathogens). Ex. Spirochaetes \\n4. Phylum: Bacteroidetes - (it has three classes, Ex. - Bacteroides, Flavobacterium, \\nFlexibacter. ) \\nThus Bergey\\'s manual is the principle resource in prokaryotic, taxonaomy and is \\nused by micro~iologists around the world. \\nFinally, it is emphasized that prokaryotic nomenclature is as much in flux as \\nclassification. The names of families and genera are fairly well established and stable \\nin the new system (At least in the absence of future discoveries). \\n000BACTERIA \\nThe word bacterium (Gk. Bakterion = little rod) originally applied by microscopists \\nfor rod shaped organism, belonging to the lowest order of the plant life or \"microscopic \\nunicellular plants without chlorophyll that reproduce by fission\". \\nAntony Von Leuvenhoek (1632 - 1723), the dutch dry goods merchant of Holland, \\nis credited with the discovery of bacteria. He observed bacteria in the scum of teeth \\nwith the help of microscope constructed by himself. He named them as \"tiny \\nanimalcules\". In 1695 he published his work \"The secrets of nature discovered by Antony \\nVan Leeuvenhoek\" for this discovery he has been called as \"Father of Bacteriology\". \\nLater Ehrenberg (1829) coined the term bacteria for these microorganism. The term \\nbacteria literally means, small stick. \\nCarl Weigert (1845-1904) developed the staining technique for bacteria. T.J. Bwoul \\n(1878) said that the bacteria causes diseases in plants. \\nGeneral Characters of Bacteria \\nBacteriology is the branch of botany under which we study the metabolism and \\nreproduction of bacteria. The general characters of bacteria are: \\n1. They are omnipresent i.e. present in soil, air and water. \\n2. They are unicellular, prokaryotic microorganism. \\n3. The cell bears a thick rigid cell wall outside the plasma membrane (because \\nof this character they are kept in plant kingdom). \\n4. They have great variation in the mode of nutrition i.e. may be autotrophic and \\nheterotrophic. In heterotrophism mode of nutrition they may be parasite \\nsaprophyte or symbiotic in nature.72 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n5. They lack true chlorophyll but few photosynthetic bacteria have a special type \\nof chlorophyll called bacteriochlorophyll. \\n6. Because of the prokaryotic nature they lack true nucleus (lacking nuclear \\nmembrane and nucleolus), genetic material is in the form of composite structure \\nknown as genophorejnucleoidjincipient nucleus. \\n7. The cell wall of bacteria is made up of mucopeptide unlike the cell wall of \\nplants (where it is made up of cellulose) \\n8. They lack mitochondria, golgi apparatus, plastid and endoplasmic reticulum. \\n9. They lack basic protein histone in their DNA. \\n10. Ribosomes are of 70s type. \\n11. At some places the plasma membrane invaginate in folds to form mesosomes. \\n12. All the enzymes required for respiration are found in the cell membrane. \\n13. Both DNA and RNA are present in the bacterial cell. DNA is in the form of \\nsingle circular chromosome (therefore the ce.il is haploid) \\n14. Vegetative reproduction is generally by binary fission, cyst, budding and \\ngonidia. \\n15. Asexual reproduction is by conidia, motile spores and endospore. \\n16. True sexual reproduction is absent in bacteria but there are examples of genetic \\nrecombination which may be of following types viz. conjugation, transduction \\nand transformation. \\nPlant like characteristic in bacteria \\nCohn (1872) reported the presence of cell wall in bacteria (which is a character \\nsimilar to plants). Along with this the various factor responsible for keeping bacteria \\nin plant kingdom are as follows: \\n(i) The cell wall is made up of cellulose in few bacteria. \\n(ii) They show filamentous growth like some plants. \\n(iii) Like plant autotrophic bacteria produces carbonic food by the use inorganic \\nsubstances (C02 and H 20). \\n(iv) Structure and some mode of reproduction of bacteria is similar to some \\nmembers of thallophyta. \\n(v) They absorb the nutritional substances in the soluble form through their cell \\nwall (like plants). \\n(vi) Bacteria has the ability to convert inorganic nitrogen into all types of -NH2 \\nacids. \\n(vii) Most of the transitional forms of bacteria and fungi are found in the nature. \\nSimilarities between Bacteria and Blue Green Algae : \\n1. Both groups bears a prokaryotic nucleus.BACfERIA 73 \\n2. Both are unicellular or colonial and the complicated structures are in filamentous \\nform. . \\n3. Both groups have similar cell wall structure and cell division. \\n4. Both lack the typical cellular organelles found in eukaryotic cells. \\n5. Genetic material is DNA without histone proteins. \\n6. Cells are surrounded by gelatinous sheath. \\n7. Both have similar cell forms viz. spherical, cylindrical and spiral. \\nB. No zoospores are formed during asexual reproduction in blue green algae and \\nbacteria. \\n9. Members of both the groups can withstand dessication and high temperatures. \\n10. Like saprophytic bacteria, blue green algae can live on dead organic matter \\nin the absence of light. \\n11. Genetic recombination is present in both blue green algae and bacteria. \\nDissimilarities between Cyanobacteria and Bacteria : \\n1. Cyanobacteria are always aflagellate while most of the bacteria are flagellate. \\n2. All cyanobacteria are aerobic while many bacteria are anaerobic. \\n3. All cyanobacteria have chlorophyll a for photosynthesis while bacteria bears \\nbacteriochlorophyll. \\n4. The source of hydrogen is H 2S in bacteria whereas it is H 20 in cyanobacteria. \\nDISTRIBUTION \\nBacteria are ubiquitousj omnipresent in their distribution. They are found in all \\nthe natural habitats i.e. soil, water and air. They occur in all the situations except in \\npits of volcanoes, deep strata or rock and rain water, distilled water in deep wells, blood \\nof normal animals. They constitute a major part of the soil microflora and intestine of \\nanimals. Viz. E. coli in the intestine of human being. Some species have been found \\nin extreme hot spring as well as extreme cold condition, these are referred to as \\nthermophilic (survive on 7B°C) and psychrophillic (on-190°C) respectively. They can \\ntolerate and remain alive at a pH lower than 1 at one end and 13 at another end. \\nGenerally 1 gm soil contains about 1000-10 million bacteria. \\nBacteria also occurs in a variety of foods and food products viz fruit, vegetables, \\nmilk, butter, cheese and milk beverages. \\nSTRUCTURE OF BACTERIAL CELL \\nSize: There is great variation in size of bacteria. They are so minute which can\\'t \\nbe seen without the help of microscope. On an average each cell of bacterium measures \\n1.25 - 2 !lm in diameter and 2-10 !lm in length. Cocci are about 0.5-2.5 Ilm in diameter\\' \\nwhile bacilli are 0.3-15!l x 0.2 -21l. The smallest rod shaped eubacterium is Dialister \\npneumosintes which measure in between 0.15!l-0.31l in size. The biggest bacteria Beggiatoa \\nmirabilis is about 16-45 Il in diameter and BO!l in length.74 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nSHAPES AND FORMS OF BACTERIA \\nBacterial cells differ in their shapes but usually three conventional shapes have \\nbeen recognized. Initially the classification of bacteria was based on their shapes but \\nnow it is not used. The various shapes are as follows: \\n(1) EllipsoidaVSphericaVCocci \\nThe term cocci has originated from a greek word; kokkos = grain or kernel. It is \\nthe simplest form of bacteria in which bacteria appears like a minute sphere (0.5~ -\\n1.25~ in diameter) they lack flagella. On the basis of arrangements cocci are further \\nclassified as follows: \\n1. Micrococci: When a bacterium appears singly e.g. Micrococcus agitis, M. aureus. \\n2. Diplococcus: When they appear in a pairs of cells e.g. Diplococcus pneumoniae. \\n3. Streptococci: When they appear in rows of cells or in chains e.g. Streptocoocus \\nlactis. \\n4. Staphylococci: When they arrange in irregular clusters like bunches of grapes \\ne.g. Stapllyloccolls aureus. \\n5. Tetracoccus: When they arrange in a sequence of four e.g. Neisseria and \\nMicrocOCCIiS te trogen us. \\n6. Sarcinae: When they arrange in cuboidal or in a different geometrical or packet \\narrangements e.g. Sarcillae lutea. \\n(2) Rod Shaped Bacteria or Bacillus \\nThe word bacillus originated from greek word, bacillii means rod or stick. There \\nends are rounded flat or pointed. There size ranges from 0.5-1.2~ in diameter and 3-\\n7~ in length. They may be flagellated or non-flagellated. Most of the bacteria causing \\ndisease in plants belongs to bacilli category. They may be of following types: \\n(i) Monobacillus: When they arrange singly. \\n(ii) Diplobacillus: When they are present in a group of two e.g. Diplobacillus \\npncu/Iloniae. \\n(iii) Streptobacillus : When they appear in chains e.g. Bacillus tuberculosis. \\n(iv) Palisade: Very rarely the bacillus arrange in a palisade arrangement. \\n(3) Spiral or Helical \\nThe origin of word is from greek word; spira means coiled. They appear like a \\ncork screw. A single spirillum has more than one turn of helix. Generally they are found \\nas free living, unicellular entity. There size ranges from 10-50~ in length and 0.5 - 3~ \\nin diameter. They are flagellated e.g. Spirillum minus, S. volutans. \\n(4) Vibrio or Coma \\nThe bacteria of this group are like \\'coma or small curved rod. They bear flagellaBACTERIA 75 \\nat their end. Their size ranges from 1.5-l.71l in diameter and upto lOll in length e.g. \\nVibrio cholarae. \\n(5) Spirochaeta \\nThese bacteria appears like a cork screw and atrichous. Their length is more as \\ncompared to their diameter. Their body is more flexible. \\n(6) Filamentous \\nThese type of bacteria are generally found in sewage water and the water coming \\nout from sugar industry or effluent of sugar industry e.g. Sphaerotilus natalls. Basically \\nthey are rod shaped bacilli which grow in an elongated chain and are covered by a \\ntubular envelope. Ferrous containing water generally contain filamentous bacteria e.g. \\nLeptothrix, Cladothrix, Nocardia and Beggiatoa. \\n(7) Stalked \\nThese bacteria are enveloped by a extra cellular structure which encloses the entire \\ncell. This structure is known as prosthecae which is a slightly hard appendage \\nappendacular structure. Because of the presence of Prostheceae they are known as \\nprosthecate bacterium. These bacteria are classified in following two groups. \\n(a) The bacteria in which prostheceae does not take part in reproduction e.g. \\nColobacter. \\n(b) The bacteria where prosthecae participate in reproduction e.g. Hypomicrobium. \\nThere stalk is about 20ll in length and are formed in nutrient media rich in \\nphosphate. The basal end of the stalk is either knobbed structure or sticky in nature. \\nMany colobacter cells unite with their lower basal knob and arrange like the petals of \\na rose. \\n(8) Pleomorphic \\nMany bacteria change their shape and structure with the change in environmental \\nconditions. These bacteria which are found in various forms are known as pleomorphic \\nbacteria e.g. Acetobacter. \\n(9) Budding Bacteria \\nThese are of football shaped structure with a swollened part and a thin tube. This \\ntube gradually increases in size and its terminal end swells up to form new cell which \\nis globular and ultimately a net work of cell is formed e.g. Rhodomicrobium. \\nULTRASTRUCfURE OF BACfERIAL CELL \\nAs bacterial cells are very minute, they are studied under electron microscope in \\nwhich it reveals various structures. Some of these are external to the cell wall while \\nother are internal to the cell wall. The brief descriptions of the readily evident structures \\nof bacteria is as follows :76 \\nRod shaped \\nor \\nBacilus \\nSpherical \\nor \\nCoccus \\nSpiral, \\nVibrio, \\nStalked & \\nBranched \\nI\\n·~: .. ,. ..... . \" :~.T.\\' \\n.. !::. .. , . .,: . \\nTEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nFig. 1 : Different shapes of bacteria \\n(i) Structure external to cell wall. \\n(a) Flagella (b) Pili (Fimbriae) (c) Capsules (d) Sheaths \\n(e) Prostheceae and stalks (f) Cell wallBACTERIA 77 \\n(ii) Structure internal to cell wall \\n(a) Cytoplasmic membrane (b) Intracellular membrane system (c) Cytoplasm \\n(d) Cytoplasmic inclusions and vacuoles (e) Nuclear material \\nPlasma Respiratory Fimbriae Cytoplasm \\nCell wall membrane chain (Pili) Capsule 1 \\n~ \\nPolysome mRNA Mesosome Nucleoid Internal Free Free Flagellum \\n(DNA) membrane ribosome onzyme \\nFig. 2 : Generalized diagram of a bacterium \\nSTRUcrURE EXTERNAL TO THE CELL WALL \\n(a) Flagella \\nBacteria can be motile or non motile. The motile form swim by means of small \\nflexible, whip like appendage called flagella (singular flagellum). They are much thinner \\nthan the flagella or cilia of eukaryotes. A typical bacterial flagellum measures about \\n120Ao thick and 4-5 Il long. Chemically they are made up of protein with a molecular \\nweight of about 40,000. The protein of the filament is known as flagellin. These bacterial \\nflagellum lacks 9 + 2 arrangement (like eukaryotes) \\nThe location of flagella varies in various bacteria. The bacteria which lack flagella \\nare referred as atrichous e.g. Diptheria bacilli and many cocci viz. Lactobacillus and Pasturella. \\nThe number and position of the attachments of the flagella on the bacterial wall vary \\naccording to the species. Therefore bacteria can be divided into following types : \\n(i) Monotrichous: Single flagellum at one end of the cell e.g. Cholera vibrio & \\nPseudomonas citri. \\n(ii) Lophotrichous: Two or more flagella at one end or both ends of the cell e.g. \\nSpirillum lllldula. \\n(iii) Amphitrichous: One or many flagella at the end of the cell e.g. Spirilla and \\nNitrosomonas. \\n(iv) Peritrichous: Many flagella attached all round the cell e.g. ,Salmonella sp. and \\nClostridium.78 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(A) Monotrichous (8) Lophotrichous \\n(C) Amphitrichous (D) Peritrichous \\nFig. 3 : Various arrangement of bacterial flagella. \\nULTRASTRUCTURE OF FLAGELLUM \\nGenerally a single flagellum is ten times long as compared to their bacterial cell. \\nThere size is variable in different species but average size ranges from 4-10~ in length \\nand 120 AO - 180Ao in diameter. These flagellum are generally made up of subunits \\nof flagellin protein. The molecular weight of these subunit is 40,OOt) dalton and 40A ° \\nin diameter. This flagellin protein is synthesized inside the bacterial cytoplasm and are \\ntransferred to the terminal distal part of the flagellum, thus the growth of flagellum \\nis from apical part inspite of its basal part. About 12 genes are found responsible for \\nthe synthesis of various parts of flagellum. Each bacterial flagellum is structurally \\ndifferentiated into three parts (1) basal body (2) hook (3) main filament or shaft. \\n(1) Basal Body: It is a small rod like structure which is attached deep in the \\ncytoplasm of the bacterial cell. This cytoplasm provide energy to this flagellum. In gram \\n-ve bacterium it possesses two sets of rings (i) a proximal set (ii) a distal set. Each \\nset consist of two pairs of rings. Outer pair is attached to the cell wall while inner \\npair is attached to the cell membrane. Thus total 4 rings are present and named as \\n(i) Membrane (ii) Supermmembrane (iii) Peptidoglycan ring (iv) Lipopolysaccharide ring. \\nThey are arranged from inner side to outerside. M ring is attached to plasma membraneBACI\\'ERIA 79 \\nwhile P and L ring structurally form a bearing for the flagellar rod to pass through \\nouter membrane. The flagellum of gram positive bacterium lacks the outer set of rings. \\nThe main function of basal body is (i) to synthesize the polymers of flagellum (ii) \\nregulation of flagellar movement. \\n(ii) Hook : Hook connects the basal body and main filament or shaft. It originates \\nfrom cell wall and the length of hook of gram negative bacterium is shorter than of \\ngram positive bacterium. The main features of hook are: \\nThey provide specific shape to the flagellum. \\nEach hook has specific antigenic property in each bacterium. \\n(3) Filament or Shaft : This is a tubular structure attached to the hook. It is 20J.! \\nlong 0.01-0.13J.! in diameter. It is made up of globular protein subunits. The amino acid \\ninvolve in the synthesis of proteins are histidine, cystine and tryptophane. These protein \\nsubunits are arranged helically and form cylindrical fibrils. The protein is called flagellin. \\nThe bacterial flagellum is made up of single thin fibril while eukaryotic motile cells \\nhas a fibrill arranged in 9 + 2 pattern. \\nFUNCTIONS OF FLAGELLA \\nThe main function of flagellum is to provide motility to the bacterial cell. \\nPeptidoglycan \\nlayer \\nPeri plasmic \\nspace \\nHook \\n,....------Grommet \\n~mtl~~m~~~:~~,.5~I.,.~ Cytoplasmic \\nmembrane \\nFig. 4 : Structure of flagellum of a gram +ve bacterium \\nPILI OR FIMBRAE \\nThese are hair like appendages present on the surface of most of the gram negative \\nbacteria (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomondaceae and Caulobacter). They are smaller than \\nflagella, have no role in the motility of bacteria. They measure 0.2-20J.! in length and \\n30-140Ao in width. A single bacterial cells bears about 100-500 pili which are arranged \\nperitrichously. There origin is from cytoplasm and penetrate through the peptidoglycan \\nlayers of the cell wall. Chemically they are composed of 100% protein named fimbrilin \\nwith a molecular weight of about 16,000. Fimbrilin consist of about 163 amino acids. \\nFollowing two types of pili are found in bacteria viz.80 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nr 17nm \\n1 \\n/\\nouter \\nL membrane \\n~~~ \\nFilament \\nHook--____________ ~ \\n8asalbody \\n~ \\nPeptidoglycan \\n~:::;~~~P layer \\n~~~~~s...l / Cy10plasmic ~ My membrane \\nFig. 5 : Structure of flagellum of gram -ve bacterium \\n(a) Somatic pili (b) Sex pili or conjugate pili \\n(a) Somatic Pili : Each bacterial cell bears about 100 somatic pili whose main \\nfunction is to help the bacterium for attachment to a substratum. \\n(b) Sex Pili or Conjugate Pili : They are also known as F pili and are controlled \\nby sex factors. These pili are comparatively long (20 ll) and broad in width (65-135AO). \\nThere number ranges from 1-10 in male or donor bacterium, but in some bacterium \\nit is found in both viz. Male donor (+ factors) or female receptor/ receiver (-factor). \\nAt the time of conjugation the sex pili of male donor recognize the receptor protein \\non the surface of female or recipient and get attached with the help ot conjugation tube. \\nThe DNA from the donor to recipient is transferred through this conjugation tube. There \\nare two types of sex pili in E.coli. They are F. pili and I.pili. \\nIn certain pathogenic bacteria these pili help the bacteria in the attachment of \\npathogenic bacterial cell to the host cells. There are generally four types of pili classified \\non the basis of their attachment ability to the host cell : \\n(a) Type I : There diameter is about 90A ° and found in E.coli, Serratia & Salmonella. \\n(b) Type II : They lack the attachment ability e.g. some species of Salmonella. \\n(c) Type III : Their attachment ability is effected by mannose sugar. They are about \\n50 A ° in diameter e.g. Klebsiella and some spp. of Salmonella. \\n(d) Type IV : They are found in Proteus bacteria. \\nFunctions of Pili \\n(i) They help the bacteria to attach themselves to the natural substrate or to other \\norganism due to its adhesive properties. \\n(ii) They bear antigenic properties.BACfERIA 81 \\n(iii) Sex pili are helpful in chromosome transfer during conjugation by acting as \\nconjugation tube. \\n(iv) They act as bacteriophage receptor. \\nFig. 6 : F-piIus \\nCapsules \\nSome bacterial cells are surrounded by a viscous substance forming a covering layer \\nor envelope around the cell wall called capsule. Electron microscopic study has revealed \\nthat capsule consist of a mesh or network of fine strands. This capsule only helps \\nin disease causing ability of a few types of bacteria. This capsule is divided into two \\ngroups: \\n(a) Macrocapsule: It is about O.21lm thick and can be seen under light microscope. \\n(b) Microcapsule: It can\\'t be seen under light microscope but can be demonstrated \\nimmunologically. \\nChemically the capsules are made up of di or polysaccharide or polypeptide. The \\npolysaccharide may be homo polysaccharide (composed of single kind of sugar) e.g. \\nStreptococcus mutans ot it may be heteropolysaccharide (composed of several kind of \\nsugars) e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae. \\nFunctions \\n(i) They provide protection against temporary drying by binding water molecules. \\n(ii) They may be antiphagocytic i.e. they inhibit the engulfment of pathogenic \\nbacteria by W.B.C. and contribute to invasive ability. \\nSheaths \\nSome species of bacteria of freshwater and marine environment form chains or \\ntrichomes which are enclosed by a hollow tube called sheath. Sheaths may be sometimes \\nimpregnated with ferric or manganese hydroxides which strengthen them . \\nProstheceae and Stalks \\nThese are semirigid extensions of cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane . They are \\ncharacteristic of a number of aerobic bacteria from freshwater and marine environment. \\nThese prosthecae may be single (ex. Caulobacter) or several (Ancalomicrobrillm) \\nThe main function of prostheceae is that they increase the surface area of the cells \\nfor nutrient absorption in the dilute environment. \\nStalk are non living ribbon like or tubular appendages that are excreted by the \\ncell. The~ stalk aid in attachment of the cells to surfaces e.g. Plallctomyces.82 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nTHE CELL WALL \\nBelow these external structures viz. capsules, sheaths, flagella and above to the \\ncytoplasmic membrane is the cell wall. This is a very rigid structure and provide definite \\nshape to the cell. Since most of the bacteria lives in hypotonic environment, this cell \\nwall prevent the cell from expanding and eventually bursting because of uptake of water. \\nThe cell wall is resistant to extremely high pressure. The cell wall constitutes a significant \\nportion of the dry weight of the cell, it may account for as such 10-40% of the dry \\nweight of bacterial cell. Bacterial cell walls are usually essential for the growth and \\ndivision of bacteria. \\nGenerally the cell wall is made up of large number of layers. The thickness of \\nthese different layers varies both in gram +ve and gram -ve bacteria. The walls of gram \\n-ve species are generally thinner (10-15 nm) than those of gram +ve species (20-25 nm). \\nSTRUCTURE AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION \\nThe most important constituent of the cell wall of eubacteria is peptidoglycan \\n(sometimes called murein) which is an insoluble, porous, cross-linked polymer of \\nenormous strength and rigidity. This peptidoglycan is only found in prokaryotes. It is \\nbasically a polymer of N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG), N acetylmuramic acid (NAM), and \\n4 amino acids (L-alanine, D-alanine, D-glutamate and a diamino acids). \\nThe tetrapeptide of one peptidoglycan layer is cross linked with the other \\npeptidoglycan layer and as a result a strong framework is formed around the cell and \\nimpart great rigidity to the total structure. Some antibiotics viz. penicillin inhibit the \\nsynthesis of this framework thus the cell wall synthesis is stopped. \\nTetrapeptide side chain \\nPeptide cross bridge \\n__ --Carbohydrate \\n\\'backbone\\' \\nFig. 7 : General structure of peptidoglycan \\nWalls of Gram +ve and Gram -ve Bacteria \\nGram + ve bacteria have a much greater amount of peptidoglycan in their cell \\nwalls than do gram - ve bacteria. The cell wall of these bacteria consist of about 40-BACfERIA 83 \\n80% of peptidoglycan of the dry weight of cell wall. This peptidoglycan is of about \\n40 or more layers in gram + ve bacteria. The cell wall measures about 30-80 nm in \\nthickness. Teichoic acid or acidic polysaccharide are mainly present in gram positive \\nbacteria and are found associated with peptidoglycan by a single terminal covalent bond. \\nTeichoic acid is a negatively charged substituted polysaccharide polymer made up of \\nribitol and glycerol residues joined through diphosphoester linkages. It constitute a major \\nCell \\nwall \\n(a) \\nO-polysaccharide Core polysaccharide \\nOuter \\nmembrane \\n(b) \\nFig. 8 : Cell walls of (a) gram +ve and (b) gram -ve bacteria \\nOut \\nLipopoly\\xad\\nsaccharide \\n(LPS)84 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nsurface antigen. It is hydrophilic and its main function is to transport positively charged \\nsubstances to the bacterial cell in the storage of phosphorous. Teichoic acid was \\ndiscovered by Baddiley (1933). \\nCell Wall of Gram Negative Bacteria \\nThe wall of gram - ve bacteria are more complex than those of gram + ve bacteria. \\nThe envelop of this kind of bacteria is made up of two unit membranes and are separated \\nby 100Ao space known as periplasmic region and contains a peptidoglycan layer. The \\noutermost membrane is known as cell wall while the inner one is referred as cytoplasmic \\nmembrane . Peptidoglycan is only about 5-10% of the dry weight of cell wall. The outer \\nmembrane serve as selective barrier for various external chemicals and enzymes that \\ncould damage the cells. Its structure is similar to plasma membrane or cell membrane. \\nThe outer membrane is anchored to the underlying peptidoglycan by means of Braun\\'s \\nlipoprotein. The membrane is bilayered structure consisting mainly of phospholipids \\nprotein and lipopolysaccharide (L.P.S.). The phospholipids are bilayered consisting of \\nboth hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends. The wall contains 4 types of protein components \\nalong with other major types of protein called lipoprotein. \\nThe Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has toxic properties and is also known as endotoxin. \\nIt occurs only in the outer layer of the membrane and is composed of three covalently \\nlinked parts : \\n(i) Lipid A = firmly embedded in the membrane. \\n(ii) Core polysaccharide = located at the membrane surface. \\n(iii) O-antigens = which extend like whiskers from the membrane surface into the \\nsurrounding medium . Many antigenic properties of gram - ve bacteria are \\nattributable to O-antigens. \\nThe outer membrane is although impermeable to large molecules but can allow \\nsmaller molecules such as nucleosides, oligosaccharide, monosaccharides, pep tides and \\namino acids. This is accomplished by means of channels in special proteins called porins. \\nStructure Internal to Cell Wall \\nCytoplasmic Membrane: Immediate below the cell wall is cytoplasmic membrane \\nwhich is similar in both gram + ve and gram -ve bacteria. It is about 75 nm thick \\nbilayered membrane and is composed primarily of phospholipids (about 20-30%) and \\nproteins (about 60-70%) . The phospholipid form a bilayer in which most of the proteins \\nare tenaciously held (integral proteins). These protein only can be removed by \\ndestruction of the membrane or by the treatment with detergents. Other proteins are \\nloosely attached (peripheral proteins) and can be removed by mild treatment such \\nas osmotic shock. Each phospholipids molecule of the bilayer has both hydrophilic \\nhead facing outwards and a hydrophobic tail facing towards each other. The lipid \\nmatrix of the membrane has fluidity. This type of structure of plasma membrane is \\nknown as fluid mosaic model. \\nThe cytoplasmic membrane act as a hydrophobic barrier for the penetration of mostBACTERIA 85 \\nwater soluble molecules. However specific proteins in the membrane facilitate the \\npassage of small molecules (nutrients and waste products) across the membrane. \\nThe cytoplasmic membrane also contains various enzymes involved in respiratory \\nmetabolism and in synthesis of capsular and cell wall components. \\nINTRACELLULAR MEMBRANE SYSTEM \\nMesosome : Bacterial cell do not contain membrane bound organelles (Viz. \\nmitochondria, chloroplast, golgi apparatus etc). But in bacteria the cytoplasmic \\nmembrane have specialized invagiantions that can increase their surface area for certain \\nfunction. \\nEspecially in gram positive bacteria these membrane invaginations are in the form \\nof convoluted tubules and vesicles termed mesomes. They are well developed in bacilli, \\nand may be 2-4 in number in each cell. Their number is higher in those bacteria involved \\nin higher respiratory activity e.g. Azatobacter. The mesosomes may be central or \\nperipheral in position. The central mesosome penetrate deeply into the cytoplasm and \\nlocated ncar the middle of the cell, and seemed to be attached to the genetic material \\nof the cell and thought to be involved in replication of DNA and cell division. While \\nthe peripheral mesosome show only a shallow penetration into the cytoplasm seem to \\nbe involved in export of exocellular enzymes such as penicillinase. \\nThe nature of mesosome was initially considered to be equivalent to mitochondria \\nof higher plants and considered to be pockets of respiratory activity since they lack \\nouter membrane they are not considered analogous to mitochondria. Along with this \\nit is also devoid of many plasma membrane enzymes viz. ATPase, dehydrogenase, \\nand cytochrome. It has been suggested that mesosomes help in the formation of septum. \\nRibosomes : Ribosomes are found in free floating conditions and are randomoly \\ndistributed in the cytoplasm. They constitute about 30% of the total weight of the \\nbacterium (10,000 -15000 ribosome in a bacterial cell). During protein synthesis a number \\nof ribosomes are held together by mRNA and form polyribosomes. The number of \\nribosome is directly proportional to the rate of protein synthesis. \\nThe ribosome of prokaryote are of 70s type whose molecular weight is about \\n2.7 million. Each 70s ribosome is composed of two subunits larger 50S and a smaller \\n30S. At low concentration of Mg+2 ions these 70S ribosome is dissociated into its two \\nsubunits. \\nRibosome of E. coli bacteria is made up of 63% RNA and 37% protein or they \\nare in 2:1 ratio. Many antibiotics like streptomycin and tetracycline who inhibit the \\nprotein synthesis in bacterial cell have a main target on the ribosome of the bacterium. \\nLamellae or Chromatophore : Lamellar thylakoid or vesicles are found in many \\nphotosynthetic bacteria. They are known as chromatophores. Lamellae are synthesized \\nby two unit membranes. These membranes are distributed throughout the cytoplasm. \\nThese chromatophore are hollow rounded structure with a diameter of about 300A 0. \\nThey bears photosynthetic pigments, enzyme required for light reaction, ETS system \\nof photophosphorylation. They lack the enzyme required for dark reaction.86 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nCytoplasm : Cytoplasm is the part of bacterial cell surrounded by cell membrane. \\nThe 80% of cytoplasm is water, rest is nucleic acid, protein, lipids, carbohydrates \\ninorganic ions and compounds of low molecular weight. The cytoplasm of prokaryote \\nlack cytoplasmic streaming and cytoskeleton. \\nCYfOPLASMIC INCLUSIONS \\nConcentrated deposits of a variety of reserve materials are detactable in the \\ncytoplasm of some bacteria,. They have high molecular weight and usually Osmotically \\ninert. They are mainly of three types : \\n(i) Polymetaphosphate (Po3-)n : They are also known as volutin granule or \\nmetachromatic granules which appear reddish violet after staining with methylene blue. \\nThey are most common in Spirillum volutans, Conjnebacterium diphtheriae and Mycobacteria. \\nThis is required during nucleic acid synthesis. \\n(ii) Poly p-Hydroxybutyrate : They serve as source of metabolic energy and stained \\nwith sudan black. It is found in Bacillus megatherium who contain about 60% of the dry \\nweight. \\n(iii) Polyglucan Granules: They appear blue, reddish blue or brown when stained \\nwith iodine. \\n(iv) Sulphur inclusions: They are found in bacteria growing in environment rich \\nin sulphur e.g. purple sulphur bacteria which utilize H 2S either as e- donor during \\nphotosynthesis or non-photosynthetic bacteria e.g. Beggiatoa and Thiothrix. \\nGAS VACUOLES \\nSome bacteria living in aquatic habitat form gas vacuoles that provide buoyancy. \\nIn light microscope these are bright, refractile bodies and can be made to collapse \\nunder pressure and there by lose their refraction. The wall is made up of protein \\nego Non pigmented members of phototroph bacteria like Polynema, Holobacterium & \\nClostridium. \\nNUCLEAR MATERIAL \\nLike other prokaryote, bacteria lack a well defined nucleus. Its genetic material \\nis designated under the area near the center of the cell and regarded as nucleoid/ \\nchromatin body or bacterial chromosome since it consist of sbgle circular DNA molecule \\nin which all genes are linked. It can be made visible under the light microscope by \\nFeulgen staining which is specific for DNA. Under Electron microscopy it appears as \\na light area with a delicate fibrillar structure. Its size measures, about 1000~ in length \\nand 3 nm in diameter. Its molecular weight is nearly 5 x 109• It has about 4000 genome \\nwhose replication is by semiconservative method. The bacterial chromosome differ from \\neukaryote chromosome in lacking histone (basic) protein however polyamines may be \\nfound to some of the phosphate group of the bacterial DNA. Polyamines are small \\nmolecules rich in amino groups.BACTERIA 87 \\nThe cross section of nucleoid show 500-900 strands folded back and forth several \\nhundred times. The size of nucleoid increases during replication. \\nPlasmid and Episomes: In many bacteria in addition to nucleoid there is an extra \\nsmall circular DNA segment which is in the form of ring is called Plasmid. There \\nreplication is autonomous. This extrachromosomal DNA fragment was first discovered \\nby Lederberg (1952). They are extrachromosomal, self replicating and stably inherited, \\nwhose size ranges from about 20-100 kb pairs (a bacterial chromosome is about 4000 \\nkbp). Plasmid has an independent replication and contain own system for initiating \\nand controlling the replication. The numbers of genes in plasmid vary from 3-4 who \\nhas no role in viability and growth of bacteria. Two types of plasmids have been \\nidentified: \\n1. Conjugative Plasmid : It carries genes that promote the transfer of plasmids \\nfrom host cell to a receipient cell by conjugation. \\n2. Non-conjugative Plasmid: It can\\'t promote its own transfer by conjugation. \\nEpisomes are the plasmid which get integrated into the bacterial chromosomes. \\nIt was discovered by Jacob, Schaeffer and Wollman (1960) \\nThe first mentioned plasmid responsible for fertility was named as fertility factor \\nor F factor. It plays an important role in conjugation in E. coli. It is about 94.5 kb long \\ncarries the gene responsible for cell attachment and plasmid transfer between specific \\nstrains of bacteria during conjugation. \\n(\"\"--\"\\'\" New strand \\nFig. 9 : Bacterial Nucleoid \\nImportant characteristic of naturally occurring plasmids : \\n1. They replicate independently of the main chromosome. \\n2. They are species specific to one or few species of bacteria.88 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n3. They can undergo reversible integration into bacterial chromosome. \\n4. A few plasmid can pick up and transfer chromosomal gene. \\n5. They can be transferred by conjugation. \\n6. They usually contain upto 40 genes. \\n7. They do not occur free in nature. \\nNUTRITION \\nAll form of life from microorganism to human beings share certain nutritional \\nrequirements for growth and normal functioning. Generally the bacteria are classified \\nin two nutritional types on the basis of their nutrition requirement: \\n, (1) Autotrophic (2) Heterotrophic \\n(1) Autotrophic \\nA very small group of bacteria possess this type of nutrition. Few bacteria possess \\nphotosynthetic pigment bacteriochlorophyll other than normal chlorophyll found in \\nhigher plants are called photosynthetic bacteria. Thus autotrophic bacteria are of two \\ntypes: \\n(i) Photosynthetic bacteria (ii) Chemosynthetic bacteria \\n(I) Photosynthetic Bacteria \\nThis type of bacteria possess a special type of pigment called bacteriochlorophyll. \\nAlong with this other pigment viz. BactE~riviridin or chlorobium chlorophyll is also found. \\nThese pigments are found on spiral structures called chromatophores. Like other higher \\ngreen plants they synthesize carbohydrate by the fixation of atmospheric CO 2, Generally \\nthis fixation process occur in the presence of sulphur compounds which is mainly H 2S \\n(hydrogen sulphide). Therefore it can be said that hydrogen sulphide is main hydrogen \\nsource in photosynthesis in bacteria and here sulphur is produced as byproduct in place \\nof oxygen (produced in higher plants) in the chemical reaction. \\nThe chemical reaction of photosynthesis is as follows \\nCO 2 + H 2S ~ (CH 20)n + 2S + H 20 + energy \\ne.g. Chromatium, Chlorobium and Chlorobacterium \\n(II) Chemosynthetic Bacteria \\nMany bacteria uses the energy released from different type of chemical reactions \\nfor the conversion of carbon dioxide into carbohydrate (because they cannot utilize the \\nphoto energy due to lack of chlorophyll). Therefore they use the energy released from \\nthe oxidation of certain substances sulphur and its compound. Ammonia, Nitrites, Iron, \\nHydrogen, Carbon monoxide, methane are certain chemical substances whose oxidation \\nis carried out by certain bacteria and the energy released is used by these bacteria for \\nthe synthesis of food. The important chemosynthetic bacteria are as follows: \\n(i) Sulphur Bacteria : The example of sulphur bacteria are Thiobacillus, Beggiatoa \\nand Thiothrix. These bacteria utilizes the energy released by the oxidation of sulphurBACTERIA 89 \\nand its compounds. For example Thiothrix oxidizes the hydrogen sulphide or mineral \\nsulphides into sulphur. This sulphur get stored inside the bacteria and later get converted \\ninto sulphate. \\n2H 2S + O 2 ~ 2S + 2H 20 + 122.2 kcal \\n2S + 2H 20 + 302 ~ 2H 2S04 + 248.4 kcal \\n(ii) Iron bacteria : These bacteria generally oxidize the ferrous ion into ferric ion \\nand releases energy. Eg - Leptothrix, Ballionella and Ferrobacillus. \\n4FeC0 3 + O 2 + 6H 20 ~ 4Fe(OHh + 4C0 2 + 81 Kcal \\n(iii) Hydrogen bacteria: These bacteria convert the molecular hydrogen into water \\nutilize the energy released during chemical reaction. Eg - Bacillus, Pantrotrophus, \\nHydromonas. \\n2H2 + O 2 ~ 2H 20 + 137 Kcal \\n(iv) Nitrifying bacteria: These bacteria utilize the energy released from nitrogen \\ncompound. They are generally of two types (i) those who oxidize ammonia into Nitrous \\ne.g. Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter (ii) who convert nitrite into nitrate e.g. NitrococCllS and \\nBactoderma. \\nAlong with this some chemo-organotroph bacteria are found who utilizes the carbon \\nand its compound as a source of energy they are of following types : \\n(i) Methane bacteria : These bacteria convert and oxidize methane into carbon \\ndioxide gas and water ego Methanococcus, Lactobacillus and Acetabacter. \\n(ii) Carbon bacteria : These bacteria use the energy released by the oxidation of \\ncarbon monoxide e.g. Bacillus oligocarbophilus. \\n\" 2CO + O 2 ~ 2C0 2 + Energy \\nHETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA \\nMost of the bacterial species are hetrotrophic in nature i.e. utilize nutrition from \\nother living being. Though they lack the photosynthetic pigment they are unable to utilize \\nsolar energy. These bacteria with the help of enzymes convert the complex organic \\ncompounds in soluble form and absorb them. These bacteria are classified into three \\ntypes: \\n(a) Saprophytic (b) Symbiotic (c) Parasitic bacteria \\n(a) Saprophytic Bacteria : They survive on dead and deteriorating organic \\ncompound. These bacteria absorb nutrition from them. Firstly they convert the complex \\norganic compound into soluble compound with the help of enzymes and then absorb \\nthem according to their requirement or absorb them conditionally. These bacteria are \\ninvolved in the deteoration of dead bodies. They also undergo the process of putrifaction \\nand fermentation of protein and carbohydrate respectively. They are generally facultative \\nparasites or obligate saprophyte. In case of facultative parasite, they can utilize nutrition \\nacting as parasite on living beings in case the dead organic matter is unavailable to \\nthem.90 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(b) Symbiotic bacteria: Those bacteria which grow and develop in close beneficial \\npartnership or association with other living organism are called symbiotic bacteria and \\nthe phenomenon is termed as symbiosis. For example these, bacteria occur in the root \\nnodules of leguminous plants where they fix free atmospheric nitrogen in the soil which \\nis utilized by plants and plants in turn provide them carbohydrate and shelter for proper \\ndevelopment ego Rhizobia spp. \\n(c) Parasitic bacteria: Those bacteria which feed themselves on living tissues (host) \\nare called parasitic bacteria. They are transmitted to the host by means of air, water \\nand food. These bacteria may be obligate parasite or facultative parasite or may \\npathogenic or non pathogenic. These bacteria cause well known harmful diseases in \\nplants and animals ego Citrus Canker, Ring rot of potato in plants and tetanus, typhoid, \\ntuberculosis and pneumonia in man. \\nREPRODUCTION IN BACTERIA \\nBacteria generally reproduce very commonly by vegetative and asexual mode of \\nreproduction. No sexual reproduction was reported by many microbiologist but electron \\nmicroscopic study reports the unidirectional genetic recombination among certain \\nbacteria. \\nReproduction in bacteria includes the following methods \\n(i) Vegetative reproduction \\nIt includes the following types \\n(1) Binary fission \\n(2) Budding \\n(3) Cyst \\n(4) Gonidia or segmentation \\n(1) Binary fission \\nThe most common and most important mode of cell division which occur in bacteria \\nwhen the environmental factor such as light, moisture, temperature are favourable is \\ntransverse binary fission. In this a single cell divides after developing a transverse septum \\n(cross wall). Bacilli and spiral bacteria divide along the longitudinal axis of the cell while \\nin coccus this division can be on any axis. Mesosomes play an important role in binary \\nfission. Binary fission occurs in following steps: \\n(a) Division of nuclear or genetic material : When bacterial cell attains its \\nmaximum size, it generally increase longitudinally. After that its circular DNA undergo \\nreplication and results into two DNA components. This replication is of semi conservative \\ntype. Now these two DNA moves to two opposite poles with the help of mesosomes. \\nBecause no spindle fibres are formed during this entire process, this division is known \\nas amitosis. \\n(b) Division of cytoplasm and septum formation: By the end of the division of \\nnuclear material, the cytoplasmic membrane start invagination in the middle of the cell.BAcrERiA 91 \\nThis invagination is of centripetal direction and the inner most layer of cell wall also \\ninvaginate along with the L2 layer of plasma membrane and it forms the septum initial. \\nThis invagination appears as constriction on the cell surface. This constriction continuously \\ndeepens and results into two daughter cells. Under favourable conditions a single binary \\nfission is completed within 18-20 minutes. But such a rapid rate of cell division cannot \\ncontinue for a long time because the rapid iPcrease in growth rate of bacterial population \\nis inhibited due to following reasons : \\n1. Lack of space, food, water, oxygen other salts and accumulation of their own \\nharmful waste products in the medium. \\n2. Environmental factors like light, temperature, moisture becomes unfavourable. \\n3. Death due to senescence and sometimes they are eaten by microscopic animals \\nand viruses. \\nTherefore survival rate of bacteria in nature is only 1 %. \\n(2) Budding \\nIn this type of process the bacterial cell wall gets thinned at the end of cell, and \\nit develops a cytoplasmic growth or protuberance which is covered by thin membrane. \\nThis structure is known as bud. It contain the part of genetic material of the parent \\ncell. This out growth increases in size and develops a constriction at its base and \\nultimately it gets separated from parent cell. Now this bud cell increases in size and \\nattain the size of parent cell ego Hypomicrobium. \\n(3) Cyst \\nCyst formation is very rare in bacteria ego Azotobacter. Cyst is a spherical cell which \\nis formed under unfavourable conditions. Here the entire protoplast of the bacterial cells \\nrounds up, shortened, constricts and separated from the cell wall. After that a thick \\ncell wall is formed around this entire structure. This structure is known as cyst and \\non germination it gives rise to a single vegetative cell. \\n(4) Gonidia or Segmentation \\nBacteria which produces extensive filamentous growth form gonidia. Here such \\nbacterial filament produces small bacillary or coccoid cells each of which give rise to \\nnew growth. \\n(ii) Asexual Reproduction: \\nIt is of following types : Increase font size like Vegetative Reproduction. \\n(1) By Conidia \\n(2) By Oidiospores \\n(3) By Sporangiospores \\n(4) By Motile spores \\n(5) By Endospores \\n(1) By Conidia \\nMany bacterial species viz Streptomyces produces small minute disc like rounded92 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nbodies in chains at the tip of their filamentous structure. They are formed in chains. \\nThe filamentous bearing conidia is known as conidiophores. Conidia are formed in \\nbasipetal succession. Each conidium germinate and produce new filamentous bacterium. \\n(2) By Oidiospores \\nThe entire filamentous structure of certain species of Actinomyces become septate \\nat its end. Thus numerous micro size reproductive units are formed which are known \\nas oidiospore. Each oidium on germination give rise to new filamentous bacteria. \\n(3) By Sporangiospores \\nMany branched filamentous bacteria become swollen at its terminal end and form \\nsporangia. The cytoplasm of these sporangia divided to form small sized sporangiospore \\nwhich on germination give rise to new filamentous bacteria under favourable condition. \\n(4) By Endospore \\nEndospore formation occurs in bacteria to tide over unfavourable environmental \\nconditions. They are produced under conditions of limited supply of carbon, nitrogen \\nand phosphorous. This process was first of all reported by Cohn (1817) and late by \\nKoch (1877). Endospores are generally formed in bacteria pathogenic to plants, animals \\nand human beings. Endospores are heat, chemical, drying, freezing and radiation \\nresistant bodies. They can survive under dormancy even upto 50 years and on getting \\nfavourable environmental conditions they may germinate to start a new bacterial \\nlife. \\nEndospores are found in bacteria like Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporolactobacillus, \\nSporosarcina and Desulfotomaclllu111. \\nGenerally a single cell transform into a single endospore but in certain cases two \\nendospores are also reported from a single cell. They may be oval, ellipsoidal or spherical \\nin shape and usually in central, terminal or sub-terminal in position. \\nThus endospore is a highly resistant structure. The resistant nature is due to \\nfollowing reasons: \\n(i) Lowest metabolic activities. \\n(ii) Very few amount of water. \\n(iii) Impermeable and protective nature of spore coat. \\n(iv) Lack of active enzymes. \\n(v) High percentage of Ca+ 2 ion in spore composition. \\n(vi) Presence of stabilizer compound i.e. Picolenic acid. \\nThe structure of endospore is variable in different species of bacteria. The cell wall \\nis multi layered and acquire more than half of the volume of spore. \\nThe bacterial protoplast core is mainly made up of DNA and is surrounded by \\ndense cytoplasm. Protein percentage is about 90% of the total volume of the protoplasm. \\nAn acid diocholinic acid act as stabilizer is found in cytoplasm. The amount of enzyme \\nis very low in the spore.BACfERIA 93 \\nThe protoplast of spore is surrounded by a very thin membrane known as core \\nmembrane. Membrane in turn is surrounded by spore wall made up of disulphide rich \\nprotein called Keratin. The spore wall is about 30-60% of the dry weight of the spore. \\nThis spore wall provide protection to the spore from unfavourable conditions and \\nharmful chemicals. \\nAn electron dense cortex is present between the spore wall and inner membrane. \\nThis cortex is made up of modified peptides. The endospore of Bacillus splzaericus lack \\nthe cortex. While in some bacteria an extra membrane, exosporium is found. Spore wall \\nis generally divided into outer and inner coat. \\nThe developmental stage of endospore formation in Bacillus subtile and Clostridium \\nhave been studied in detail and consist of stage 0 (Vegetative stage) to VII stage. \\nUnder unfavourable condition when there is no cellular division and there is \\nscarcity of A TP or energy in the cell, a special gene become active and is found \\nresponsible for the formation of endospore. In the presence of RNA polymerase enzyme \\nthis gene synthesize a special protein which initiate the formation of endospore in the \\ncell. \\nFitz-James & Young (1969) studied the process of formation of endospore in \\nClostridium Electron microscopically This can be divided into six main steps which are \\nas follows: \\n(1) 0 Stage: In this stage the cell which is going to form endospore, enlarges in \\nsize and its chromatin material condenses attain the shape of an axial filament reaching \\nfrom one end to the another end of the cell. \\n(2) I Stage: Axial filament develop completely. There is a change in the metabolic \\nactivity of the cell. \\n(3) II Stage: The plasma membrane start invaginating towards the one end of the \\ncell. This invagination grows centripetally and both the end unite to form a spore septum. \\nSeptum formation ends by the formation of a small spore known as fore spore. The \\ngenetic material also get transported to this structure. \\n(4) III Stage : Spore septum of both i.e. mother cell and fore spore grows around \\nthe protoplasm of fore spore by a process called engulfment. Thus fore spore lies freely \\nin the cytoplasm of mother cell. \\n(5) IV Stage : Cell wall of peptidoglycan is synthesized outside the plasma \\nmembrane of fore spore. This structure is called as spore wall. \\n(6) V Stage: There is a deposition of peptidoglycan cortex between the spore wall \\nand cell membrane. The protoplasm condenses and synthesize dipiconilic acid whose \\ndeposition occurs on cell membrane. There is an increase in the concentration of Ca +2, \\narginine and glutamic acid in the spore cytoplasm. Spore wall become multilayered. \\n(7) VI Stage : The spore mature into spore mother cell, the mother cell is called \\nas sporangium. \\n(8) VII Stage : There is autolysis of sporangium and the spore is released free \\nin the environment and it is transmitted by air.94 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe Endospore formation in Clostridium requires 2 hrs while Bacillus subtilis requires \\n7 hours. After transmission these endospores lie dormant for many years. \\nGERMINATION OF ENDOSPORE \\nThe process of germination start under favourable environmental conditions. Spore \\ncoat becomes soft by the imbibition of water. The cytoplasm of spore swells up by \\nabsorbing salts, nutrients and water. Thus as a result the upper spore coat breaks \\nup and the developing cell comes out. Generally a single spore is formed from a single \\nbacterial cell and on germination of a single spore a single bacterial cell is formed. \\nThus endospore formation is considered to be the perennation method of bacterium. \\nEndospores \\nBacterial cell \\nD \\nE \\nFig. 10 : Structure of endospore \\nSEXUAL REPRODUCfION OR GENETIC RECOMBINATION \\nUnlike other prokaryote no true sexual reproduction is found in bacteria because \\n(a) they lack sexual structures (b) no gametic fusion takes place. Karyogamy and meiosis \\nis also absent in bacteria. Bacteria are haploid organisms. Gene transfer in bacterial cell \\ndonot produce zygotes but partial diploid called mero-zygotes. The original genome \\nof recipient is named as endogenate. While the portion of DNA introduced from donar \\ncell into recipient cell is called exogenome. However three different mechanism were \\nlater discovered for transferring gene or genetic material from one bacterial cell to \\nanother. These mechanisms in order of their discovery are \\n(i) TransformationBACTERIA \\n(ii) Conjugation \\n(iii) Transduction \\n(i) Transformation \\n95 \\nIt was first observed by Griffith (1928) who noted the transformation of harmless \\nPneumococci into virulent ones. Here there is transfer and expression of naked DNA \\nfrom donor to recipient cell of bacteria takes place. \\nTransformation was discovered by Fredrick Griffith (1928) an English microbiologist \\nwhile working on two strains of Diplococcus pneu11lolliae (new name Streptococcus \\npneumoniae). He reported that DNA is a genetic material. \\nGriffith used two strains of D. p\"eu11loniae (i) bacteria with smooth and capsulated \\ncell wall called as SIll (virulent or pathogenic) \\n(ii) Bacteria with rough and non capsulated cell wall called as RII avirulent or non \\npathogenic). \\nSIll is found responsible for causing death in mice while RII does not cause \\npneumonia in mice. \\nHe carried out the following experiments on mice with these two strains. These \\nare as follows : \\n(i) No death of mice occur while injecting the RII bacterial strain in mic~. \\n(ii) Death of mice occur while injecting the SIll strain of bacteria. \\n(iii) No death occur in mice while injecting it with the heat killed (heated at 850q \\nSIll strain. \\n(iv) Death of mice occurred while injecting it with a combination of heat killed \\nSIll strain + live RII strain of Diplococcus pnhenumoniae. The virulent sm and \\nnon virulent RII strains were isolated from killed mice. Thus it was concluded \\nthat by receiving the genetic material of heat killed virulent SIll strain, the \\nliving RII strains produces the progeny of virulent and pathogenic sm strain. \\nAlthough Griffith was unable to identify the transforming principle. \\nBased on the Griffith experiment O.T. Avery, Macleod and Maccarty performed \\nfurther experiment in vitro system. They identified the transforming substance in 1944 \\nas the polysaccharide present in the capsule of virulent strain SIll of pneumococcus which \\nwas absent in non virulent RII strain. Thus it was concluded that the DNA fragments \\nisolated from dead mice get transformed into pathogenic and virulent sm strain. This \\nexperiment explained that DNA is a genetic material. \\nFor transformation the donor DNA must be single stranded and of specific size \\nwhich transforms very easily in the RII strain of bacteria. During transformation the \\nDNA fragment of SIll strain, bind and finally integrate in the bacterial chromosome \\nof RII strain. The replaced portion of DNA of RII strain get destroyed. \\nTransformation is entirely a laboratory procedure and never occur in nature.

The genetic material from one cell (donor \\nor male) is transferred to other (recipient or female). \\nLederberg .and Tautum (1946) used two mutant of the E.coli strain K12. Both mutant \\nrequire certain growth factors while culturing on minimal media. These bacterial strain \\nare known as Auxotrophs. Strains A of E. coli require methionine and biotin for there \\ngrowth. There genotype is Met- Bio- while strain B require Thrionine, Leucine and \\nThiamine for their growth. There genotype is Thr-, Leu-, Thi-.BACTERIA 97 \\nThe culture of both, strain A and strain B of E. coli were mixed and centrifuged \\nand washed to remove the previous culture media. After that they were cultured in \\nminimal medium. It was found that both the strains were able to grow in minimal \\nmedium or it was concluded that both strains (previously auxotrophs) get converted \\ninto prototrophs or it was confirmed from the above experiment that the conjugation \\nrecombination of both auxotrophic strain viz. Strain A (met- bio-) and strain \\nB (Tht, Leu-, Thr-) resulted in the formation of prototrophic strain (Met+ Bio+ Thr+ Leu+ \\nThi+). This experiment explain th.e genetic recombination by conjugation. \\nFertility factor or F factor in conjugation was first of all discovered by William \\nHayes (1950) in E. coli. He reported that in E.coli a plasmid is present in the form of \\nfertility ~actor. E.coli is classified in two strains on the basis of presence and absence \\nof F factor. They are as follows : \\n(i) F+ strain bearing the fertility factor, also known as donor cell. It always bears \\nsex pili or F pili on its surface. \\n(ii) F- strain lacking the fertility factor, also known as recipient cell. It lacks sex \\npili or F pili on its surface. \\n(iii) According to Hayes in E. coli this sexual recombination is unidirectional where \\nthe genetic material is transferred to the recipient cell from the donor cell. This \\nprocess occurs in following steps : \\n(a) In a group of bacterial cell the cells of two opposite strains viz. F+ and \\nF- comes towards each other get attached by the sex pili. After that a tubular \\nstructure called as conjugation tube is formed. \\n(b) The DNA of bacterial plasmid is double stranded which become single \\nstranded by the activity of enzyme endonuclease which create a nick as \\na result a 5\\' to 3\\' end of single stranded DNA becomes free. \\n(c) This single stranded DNA of the donor cell moves towards the recipient \\ncell through the conjugation tube. The donor DNA moves by its 5\\' end \\ninto the recipient cell. \\n(d) The conjugation is completed after the transfer of single stranded DNA \\ninto the recipient cell. As a result both F+ and P- cells are separated. \\n(e) The single stranded plasmid DNA of donor cell combine with the recipient \\nDNA strand with the help of enzyme ligase. \\n(f) The single stranded DNA of donor and recipient cell synthesize its \\ncomplementary strand and becomes double stranded. Thus the recipient \\nF- strain change into F+ donor strain. . \\nHIGH FREQUENCY RECOMBINATION OR HFR TRANSFER \\nJacob & Wollman (1951) reported, when F+ plasmid of donor reaches to the F\\xad\\nplasmid of recipient cell in the newly formed F+ cell (previously P- recipient cell) this \\nplasmid occur in two stages (i) either it lie independently in the cytoplasm of F+ cell \\n(ii) or it get combined with the bacterial chromosome. This later stage where the F+98 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nfactor combines with the bacterial chromosome is known as episome. The term episome \\nwas used by Lederberg et al. (1952). This type of bacterial cell convert into high, \\nreproductive ability donor or male cell. This process is known as high frequency \\nrecombination or Hfr male. The reproductive ability of Hfr strain is 1000 times more \\nthan of F+ strain. The integration of plasmid DNA with this genophore (F bacterial \\nDNA) can occur in 20 parts. \\nConjugation in HFr male: During conjugation a conjugation tube is formed \\nbetween the Hfr male and F\" recipient cell. After that the donor DNA opens near the \\nF+ factor and become single stranded. Now this single stranded DNA moves slowly \\nfrom the donor cell to the recipient cell. This transfer process is continued until, both \\nthe Hfr and F- cells are separated naturally. After this separation some part of DNA \\nof Hfr strain remain inside the F- recipient cell and get combined with the DNA of \\nrecipient cell as a result new genes are integrated into the recipient F- cell. The \\ncombination of both the DNA results into the formation of a genetic hybrid which is \\npartially diploid. This type of reproduction is found in Salmonella, Pseudomonas, Vibrio \\nand E. coli. \\nSexduction : Jacob Adelberg (1959) reported this process in bacteria. In general \\nin Hfr strains the F+ factor is integrated with the bacterial chromosome but some times \\nthis F+ factor separate from the bacterial chromosomes and becomes fully autonomous \\nand replicate independently. \\nSometimes during separation this F+ factor contains some genes of the bacterial\\' \\nchromosome and now it is called as F+ prime. When this F+ prime cells comes in contact \\nwith the F- recipient cell it transfer some of the genes are taken from the DNA of the \\nprevious bacterial cell. This process is known as sexduction and as a result the recipient \\ncell become partly diploid and the structure is called as merozygote. \\nBacterial \\nDNA \\nConjugation tube \\nA B C \\nF, factor Replication of F. factor \\n...... ·0·:·· .. \\'·:·1 .. :.& .. : .. : .. :. ;~~: .~: .. ;.. ;~;: .::\\';\\'. .:~~Ol.:·;·· .:{~O·~:··;·· \\n.;0.: I:\\' to:;;: .\" ,~ ... : .. :::\\':: ,0,:.\\' :o.::i:: ,~~: :-,::i:: \\'. :\\' ... : •. : ... \\' ....... ;\\'. \\'.: •. :.:. . : .....•... :. . ... :-.. ! ... ;.

Transduction has been reported \\nin E.coli, Proteus, Schizella and Staphylococcus. \\nZinder and Lederberg (1952) initially began their experiments with the objective \\nof discovering whether the E. coli type of genetic exchange also existed in S. hjphimuriulll. \\nThey cultivated two extotrophic strains of S. hjphimuriu11l. The stram A was unable to \\nsynthesize the amino acids, phenylalanine and tryptophan (Phe-, Try-) but could \\nsynthesize methionine and Histidine (Phe-Try-Met+ His+). The other strain was unable \\nto synthesize methionine and histidine but able to synthesize phenylalanine and \\ntryptophan (Phe+ Try+ Mer His\"). Crossing or combine culturing of strain A and strain \\nB resulted in a wild type prototroph which could synthesize all four amino acids. (Phe + \\nTry+ Met+ His+). Each auxotrophic strain, A and B was placed in both the arms of Davis \\nU-tube. The two arms of tube were separated by a sintered glass filter which was \\nimpervious to bacterial cells but allowed the free passage of nutrient media and other \\nmolecules particles smaller than D.11l. The culture medium was made to pass through \\nthe filter from one arm to the other by alternating suction and pressure. Thus the two \\nauxotrophic strain although physically separate were grown in the same medium. \\nA large number of prototroph appeared in the experiment. Thus it was concluded \\nthat these protrotrophs are obtained by the method other than conjugation. Because this \\nprocess was resistant to DNA enzyme activity, transformation process can\\'t bt: involved \\nin the synthesis of these prototroph. Thus the production of prototrophic Salmonella strain100 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nis due to the activity of certain filterable agent which was later called as Bacteriophage \\nP22. The transducing frequency is low and our only one in 105 to 107 cells undergo \\ntransduction. \\n~ Hershey and Chase (1952) at the same time discovered bacteriophage and explained \\nthat during the infection of bacteria by bacteriophage there is a transfer of nucleic acid \\nof bacteriophage into the bacterial cell. \\nTransduction is generally of two types: \\n1. Generalized transduction \\n2. Specialized transduction. \\n1. Generalized Transduction : It is completed in following steps: \\n(1) This type of transduction starts with the infection of bacteria with the \\nbacteriophage. This process is controlled by the DNA segments called as \\nprophage particle present in the cytoplasm of bacterial cell. \\n(2) During the infection of the lysosgenic bacterial cell by bacteriophage, the DNA \\nof the bacteria breaks down into small fragments and the nucleic acid of the \\nbacteriophage utilizes the bacterial enzymes and synthesize new phage \\ncomponents. \\n(3) At the same time when these progeny phage particles are form the DNA \\nfragments of the bacteria incorporate into these DNA particles of the phage. \\n(4) The genetic material or DNA fragments of the previous bacterial cell is \\ntransferred to the new bacterial cell infected by these progeny phage particles. \\nThus generalized transduction is the process where bacterio phage plays an active \\nrole in the transfer of DNA fragments of the bacterial cell. \\n2. Specialized Transduction: Andre Lwoff et al. (1953) reported that ceitain \\nbacterial strains are able to survive for a long time even after infected by the \\nbacteriophage and these is no lysis of bacterial cell. Here in these bacteria there is a \\njoining of bacterial DNA with the phage DNA and both DNA i.e. bacterial DNA and \\nphage DNA replicate commonly. This bacteria is known as lysogenic bacteria and the \\nphage is called as prophage. \\nThis bacterial celIs can survive in lysogenic stage for many generations which is \\ndue to the synthesis of a special repressor protein. This protein inhibits the synthesis \\nof phage particle inside the bacterial cell. As the synthesis of this protein is stopped \\nthe bacterial cell start the synthesis of phage components. \\nThe DNA of both i.e. of phage DNA and bacterial DNA break~ down before the \\nsynthesis of the phage particles starts. At the same time some bacterial genes are carried \\nout by phage DNA and replicate with the phage DNA. These resultant progeny phage \\nparticles are entirely different from the parent one when these progeny phage particles \\ninfect a new bacterial cell, some of the gene (of the previous bacterial cell) are also \\ntransmitted to the newly infected bacterial cell. In this type of transduction only those \\nspecial genes are transmitted which are attached very closely to the phage DNA.BACfERIA \\nD \\nc pq060 Q O -0«0 9 \\'00 \\nBacteria\\'DNA 1 \\nB \\nViral DNA \\n0) \\n~ViraIDNA \\nT _ Bacteria\\' DNA \\nE \\n1 :cteria, DNA \\nG \\'0 \\nH \\nViral DNA \\nFig. 13 : Transduction in bacteria \\nGram Staining \\n101 \\nOne of the most important and widely used differential staining technique in \\nmicrobiology is called Gram staining. This technique was introduced by Christian Gram \\n(1884). In this process the fixed bacterial smear is subjected to the following staining \\nreagents in the order, crystal violet, iodine solution, alcohol (decolorizing agent), and \\nsafranin. Bacteria stained by the gram method fall into two groups: Gram positive \\nbacteria which retain the crystal violet and hence appear deep violet in color, and gram \\n-ve bacteria which loses the crystal violet and counterstained by safranin and hence \\nappear pink in colour. \\nThe most plausible explanation for this phenomenon are associated with the \\nstructure and composition of the cell wall. The cell wall of gram negative bacteria is \\ngenerally thinner than those of gram positive bacteria. Gram negative bacteria contain \\na· higher percentage of lipid than do Gram p~sitive bacteria. During staining of gram \\nnegative bacteria the alcohol treatment extracts the lipid which results in increased \\nporosity or permeability of the cell wall. Thus the crystal violet -iodine (CV - I) complex102 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\ncan be extracted and the gram negative organism is decolorised. These cells subsequently \\ntake on the color of the safranin counterstain. The cell wall of gram positive bacteria, \\nbecause of their different composition (lower lipid content), become dehydrated during \\ntreatment with alcohol. The pore size decreases, permeability is reduced and the \\nCV-I complex can\\'t be extracted. There for these cells remain purple violet. \\nAnother explanation is also based on permeability differences between the two \\ngroups of bacteria. In gram positive bacteria, the CV-I complex is trapped iD. the wall \\nfollowing the ethanol treatment which presumably causes a diminution in the diameter \\nof the pores in the cell wall peptidoglycan. Walls of gram negative bacteria have a very \\nmuch smaller amount of peptidoglycan, which is less extensively cross-linked than that \\nin the walls of gram positive bacteria. The pores in the peptidoglycan of gram negative \\nbacteria remain sufficiently large even after ethanol treatment to allow the CV-I complex \\nto be extracted. \\nThe two explanations, both contribute to the explanation of the\\'mechanism of the \\ngram stain. Furthermore if gram positive cells are treated with lysozyme (an enzyme) \\nto remove the cell wall, the resulting structure called protoplast will be stained by the \\nCV - I complex. However they are easily decolarized by alcohol. All these evidence \\npoints to the cell structure of gram positive bacteria as the site of retention of the primary \\nstain. \\n(3) Many bacterial species are pathogenic to human beings, animals and plants. \\nThe parasitic bacteria pathogenic to human beings are as follows : \\nDisease Bacteria \\n1. Choll!ra Vibrio cholerae \\n2. Diptheria ConJnebacterium diphtheriae \\n3. Pneumonia Streptococcus pneumoniae \\n4. Tuberculosis Microbacterium tuberculosis \\n5. Dysentry Schizella dysenteriae \\n6.

Plague Pasteurella pestis \\n12. Leprosy Mycobacterium leprae \\n13. Diarrhoea Bacillus coli \\n14. Gastroenteritis Escherichia coli \\nThe parasitic bacteria destroys many economically important food crops. The \\ndisease produced by these bacteria in plants are as follows :BACTERIA 103 \\n(i) Wilt : Pseudomonas solanaceanml produces wilting in potato, brinjal and many \\ncucurbits. Bacteria causes blocking of vessels in plants resulting in wilting. \\n(ii) Rots : Erwinia, aroideae causes rot disease in potato, raddish, tomato and \\ncauliflower. \\n(iii) Blights : are caused by Erwinia amylovera in apple, pears who destroy the \\nparenchymatous cells. \\n(iv) Crown gall : These are caused by Agrobacteriu11l tllmijaciells and causes \\nhypertrophy in apple etc. \\n(v) Citrus canker: This is caused by XantllOnlOllaS citri in lemon. It produces corky \\ngrowth on the leaf and outer wall of the fruit. \\n(4) Many harmful bacteria are responsible for the reduction of soil fertility or \\ndenitrification. ego Bacillus denitrijicalls, Thiobacilills denitrificalls and Micrococcus dellitrificalls \\nare very harmful to the agriculture because the convert the nitrate, nitrite, ammonia \\nand other compounds in nitrogen into free atmospheric nitrogen. This results in reduction \\nof fertility of soil. These bacteria are known as denitrifying bacteria. The percentage \\nof these bacteria is very less in the soil. \\n(5) Penicillin Destruction: Some bacteria secrete an enzyme penicillinase which \\ndestroys the beneficial antibiotic penicillin. \\n(6) Cotton destruction: A bacterial species Spirochaete cytophage destroys the cotton \\nfibres. \\n(7) Water Pollution: Many aquatic bacteria convert the mercury and its compounds \\ninto highly toxic methyl mercury from the affluent coming out from factories. This \\ncompound is highly toxic to the human beings and it is also neurotoxic in nature. Many \\npathogenic bacteria like Vibrio cholariae, Sclzizella dysellteriae and Salmonella hJPhiae produces \\nand causes many water born diseases in human beings like cholerea, dysentery, typhoid. \\n000VIRUSES \\nViruses may be generalized to define as \\'very small sized etiological agents of \\ndisease that are capable of passing through filters that retain even bacteria, increase \\nonly in the presence of living cells, and give rise to new strains by mutation\\'. \\nMayer (1886) showed that the juice from the infected plants of tobacco could \\nreproduce the disease if applied to healthy plants. The Russian botanist Dimitri \\nIvanowski (1892), demonstrated that the causal organism of tobacco mosaic could even \\npass through the finest porcelain filter that withholds bacteria. Ivanowski also showed \\nthat this filterate was capable of transmitting the disease to healthy susceptible plants. \\nHe also indicated that these causal organism were even smaller than bacteria. \\nBeijerinck (1898) a Dutch microbiologist, showed that the causal agent or tobacco \\nmosaic could diffuse through an agar membrane and was therefore liquid in nature \\nsuch a liquid causal agent of tobacco mosaic was called by Beijerinck as \"Contagium \\nvivum fluidium\\' or \\'living infection fluid\\'. Bacteriophages (viruses that parasitise \\nbacteria) were discovered by the French scientist D. Herelle (1917) who found that some \\nagent was destroying his cultures of bacilli. \\nSchelsinger (1933) was the first to determine the decomposition of virus. He showed \\nthat a bacteriophage consist of only protein and DNA. \\nBowden (1964) defined viruses as \\'submicroscopic, infective entities that multiply \\nonly intracellularly and are potentially pathogenic. According to Hahon (1964) viruses \\nare \\'bits of infectious heredity in search of a chromosome\\'. \\nSome define viruses as \\'infectious nucleoproteins\\'. The word virus is derived from \\nthe latin language meaning \\'poisonous liquid or \\'poison\\'. \\nIn 1935 Stanley crystallized the virus causing tobacco mosaic disease, and \\ndemonstrated that the crystals retained their infectivity when inoculated into healthyVIRUSES 105 \\nplants Hershey and Chase (1952) studied the T2 bacteriophage and demonstrated that \\n(1) the genetic information is carried in the phage DNA and (2) that infection is the \\nresult of penetration of viral DNA into cells. \\nThe nucleic acid fraction of the virus is the actual infectious agent was first shown \\nby Gierrer and Schramm (1956). Phycophages were first isolated by Schafferman and \\nMorris (1963) from blue green alga LyngbtJa. The phage isolated by them was found \\nto infect Plectono1lema and Phormidiunl also (hence named LPP-1), these are cyanophages. \\nMycophages were first discovered in mushroom (Agaricus bisp0nls) by Sinden in \\n1957. \\nGENERAL CHARACfERS OF VIRUSES \\n(1) They do not occur free in nature but act as obiigate intracellular parasite. \\n(2) They are extreme microscopic structure which can only be seen by electron \\nmicroscope. \\n(3) Mainly the size ranges from 100-2000 millimicron. \\n(4) They can not be filtered by bacterial filters. \\n(5) The genetic material is either DNA or RNA which occurs in the form of single \\nmolecule and can be single or double stranded. \\n(6) A single virus particle is known as virion which lacks functional autonomy. \\n(7) They lack their own enzyme system but interact with the host enzyme system \\nand synthesize new virus particles. Thus they have a .master and slave \\nrelationship. \\n(8) Outer capsid of virus is proteinaceous and harmless and provide cellular \\nspecificity to the virus. \\n(9) They are intracellular obligate parasite and can\\'t be cultured on artificial culture \\nmedia. \\n(10) All animal and plant viruses have a narrow host range while others show a \\nbroad host range. \\n(11) They show replication. \\n(12) They are highly infectious and spread disease very quickly. \\n(13) They show special kind of pathogenecity i.e. they cause disease at particular \\ntemperature. Most of virus become inert at 56-69°C (for 30 minutes) \\n(14) They are haploid. \\n(15) They are uneffected by antibiotics. \\n(16) They show life between 5-9 pH. \\n(17) They remain active for a long time when kept in 50% glycerol solution. \\n(18) The extract of virus become inert at high pressure and high sound frequency. \\n(19) They get precipitated with ethyl alcohol and acetone.106 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(20) They can be inerted by treatment with ultraviolet rays, pyridine, ~rea and \\nhydrogen peroxide. \\n(21) They can be crystallized. \\n(22) They show response toward temperature, radiation and chemical substances. \\n(23) They lack cell wall, nucleus, protoplasm and cell organelles. \\nHow do Virus differ from Bacteria and Mycoplasmas? \\nViruses differ from bacteria and mycoplasmas in : \\n(i) not possessing any cellular organization. \\n(ii) Not growing on inanimate media. \\n(iii) not multiply by binary fission. \\n(iv) Not possessing both DNA and RNA together. \\n(v) Not possessing ribosome. \\n(vi) Not showing any sensitivity to antibiotics. \\n(vii) Showing sensitivity to interferon. \\nNATURE OF VIRUSES \\nThe nature of viruses is still not clear, because it is not easy to define them within \\nthe accepted framework of living or non living organisms. Some virologist regard viruses \\nas animate object (when present inside the host cell) whereas other consider them \\ninanimate (when present outside the host cell). \\nViruses are living because: \\n(i) They show growth and multiplication (only inside the host cell). \\n(ii) They have genetic material i.e. DNA/RNA. \\n(iii) They can direct protein synthesis (though they use host machinery for it). \\n(iv) They show mutation. \\n(v) They can be transmitted from the diseased host to the healthy ones or posses \\nthe ability to infect. \\n(vi) They react to heat, chemicals and radiation and also shows irritability, a \\ncharacter of only living organisms. \\n(vii) They posses genetic continuity and have definite races/strains. \\n(viii) Similarity between nucleoproteins of viruses with the protein and nucleic acid \\nof living organisms. \\nViruses are non-living because: \\n(i) They can be crystallized (Stanley, 1935) \\n(ii) They behave as inert chemicals outside the host cell. \\n(iii) A cell wall or cell membrane of any type is absent in viruses. \\n(iv) They do not show functional autonomy.VIRUSES 107 \\n(v) They do not respire or excrete or they do not show any sign of metabolism \\nexcept reproduction. \\n(vi) They lack any energy producing enzyme system. \\nTherefore the contention that \\'viruses are viruses\\' (Lwoff et al., 1966) and nothing \\nelse \\'stands on the top\\'. According to regressive theory of evolution put forward by \\nLwoff, some primitive microorganism (like bacteria) become endoparasitic on some host \\nand gradually lost synthetic enzymes to become today\\'s viruses. Thus viruses are super \\nparasities. It will thus be seen that viruses do not show all the characteristic of typical \\nliving organisms. They however possess two fundamental characteristic of living systems. \\nFirstly they contain nucleic acid as their genetic material. The nucleic acid contains \\ninstruction for the structure and function of the virus. Secondly they can reproduce \\nthemselves, even if only by using the host cell\\'s synthesis machinery. Because of such \\ncharacters, some virologist consider viruses as a transition stage between living and non \\nliving world. They are living organism with some non living characters. \\nOccurrence \\nThe occurrence of viruses in the cells of bacteria and higher plants and animals \\nis well established. \\nPlant viruses: Most plant viruses have been found in angiosperm (flowering \\nplants). Relatively few viruses are known in gymnosperm, ferns, fungi or algae. Plant \\nviruses are of great economic importance, since they cause plant diseases in a variety \\nof crops. \\nAnimal viruses: Virus diseases are known in a variety of vertebrates including \\nfish, amphibian, birds and mammals. Important virus diseases of humans include \\npoliomyelitis, small pox, rabies, mumps, measles, yellow fever, influenza and encephalitis. \\nBacteriophages: Viruses have been found in practically all groups of bacteria. The \\nhost range is confined within bacterial groups. A bacteriophage may multiply only in \\ncertain strains of E.coli. \\nVIRUSES IN EUKARYOTIC MICROORGANISM \\nVirus like particles have been observed in species of Protozoa, algae and fungi. \\nProtozoa: Viruses or virus like particles have been observed in several protozoa viz., \\nleishmania, Entamoeba histolytica, Plasmodium vivax, P. berghei, Paramecium aurelia, Carclzesill1ll \\npolypinum and Acanthamoeba sp. A virus like particle has been reported in Plasmodium \\nberghei. Its structure is like that of a cytoplasmic Polyhedrosis virus, a dsRNA virus of \\ninsects. \\nAlgae: Virus like particles have been reported in Aulacomonas subnzarina, Chara, \\nCorralina, Oedogonium spp., Uronema gigas. Bacteriophage like virus particles have been \\nfound in Chiorella and have been called chlorellophages. \\nFungi: Killer phenotypes associated with the strains of Saccharomyces cerervisiae \\nand Ustilago maydis have been shown to be virus related. dsDNA viruses have been \\ndetected in cells of Penicillium moulds. dsRNA viruses are widely present in the higher108 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nfungi. The bacilli form particles of Agaricus bisporous is the only fungal virus reported \\nthat contains ssRNA. \\nDEFINITION \\nVirion: A single infective particle of virus is called as virion. It consists of nucleic \\nacid core surrounded by a protein coat or capsid. The capsid with enclosed nucleic acid \\nis called nucleocapsid. \\nViroids: These are the smallest infectious agents causing diseases in host. They \\nconsist solely of a protein free low molecular weight (75,000 - 1,25,000 dalton) with \\n243-360 nucleotides and small fragments of double stranded RNA molecules. They are \\nalso known as naked virus, meta virus or pathogene. \\nEvidence shows that viroids replicate by direct RNA copying in which all components \\nrequired for viroid replication including RNA polymerase are provided by the host. During \\nviroid replication, the circular (+) strand of the viroid is replicated while it acts as a rolling \\ndrum producing multimeric linear strands of (-) RNA. The linear (-) strand then serves \\nas a template for replication of multimeric strand (+) of RNA. The (+) RNA is subsequently \\nprocessed (cleaved) by enzymes that release linear, unit length viroid (+) RNA\\'s which \\ncircularize and produce many copies of the original viroid RNA. \\nViroids apparently interfere with the host metabolism in ways resembling those \\nof viruses but of what way is still unclear. It has been shown that both virus specific \\nRNA\\'s synthesized during infection and viroid RNA in vitro activate a protien kinase \\nenzyme, which in turn activates other cellular enzymes while it impedes the initiation \\nof protein synthesis. As viroid strain that cause mild to severe plant symptoms activate \\nthe protein kinase more than 10 times as much as mild strains, it is possible that \\nactivation of the protein kinase represents the triggering event in viroid pathogenesis \\nand in disease development by the plant. \\nViroids are spreaded from diseased to healthy plants primarily by mechanical \\nmeans, i.e. sap carried through hands or tools during cultural practices while some are \\ntransmitted by pollen and seed. \\nViroids survive in nature outside the host or in dead plant matter for periods of \\ntime from few minutes to few months. They are quiet resistant to high temperature \\nand can\\'t be inactivated in infected plant by Heat treatment. \\nThe control of diseases caused by viroids is based on the use of viroid-free \\npropagating stock, removal and destruction of viroid infected plants and washing of \\nhands or sterlizing of tools after handling viroid infected plants before moving on to \\nhealthy plants. \\nPotato spindle tuber viroid (PSTvd) is the first recognized viroid, which consist \\nof 359 nucleotides under E.M. Purified PSTvd appears as short strands about 40 nm \\nlong and has the thickness of a dsDNA. \\nViroids seem to be associated with cell nuclei particularly the chromatin and \\npossibly with the endomembrane system of the cell. \\nIt was first discovered by Diener (1971) as the causal agent of potato spindle tuber \\ndisease. Other viroid caused disease reported so far are-tomato bunchy top disease,VIRUSES 109 \\nchrysanthemum stunt disease, coconut cadang disease, tomato apical stunt disease, \\nAvocado sunblotch etc. \\nThey undergo replication by using the host enzyme system. Their transmission is \\nthrough the cromatin material of host cell. \\nVirusoides: It has been introduced by Rendle et al (1981). \"Virusoides are the \\nviroides which require RNA of the supportive virus for replication\". \\nAt present it has been reported only in Australia with few examples of its host. \\nviz. one virusoide is reported along with velvet tobacco mosaic virus. Other virusoides \\nare attached as satellite along with other virus RNA. \\nThese virusoides undergo replication with the help of RNA of the helper virus \\ninside the host cell. \\nPrions: Haig and Claske (1966) discovered a subviral infectious agent which was \\nlater called as prions by Prusiner et al. Later Prof. Prusiner has been awarded nobel \\nPrize (1997) for medicine for the discovery of prions. \\nThese prions are the causal agent of scrapie disease (a degenerative disorder of \\ncentral nervous system) of sheep and goat. These prions have no nucleic acid (DNAj \\nRNA) but they are made up of only 2-3 molecules of protein only. \\nPrions are 100 times shorter than viruses and are heterogenous in nature. A single \\nprion rod is made up of about 1000 prion molecules. It is 100-200 nm long and 10-\\n20 nm in diameter. Other disease caused by prions are Parkinson\\'s disease, multiple \\nsclerosis, Gerstmann Stransslar syndrome and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. \\nSIZE AND STRUCTURE OF VIRUSES \\nThe size of viruses is variable. Most viruses are much smaller than bacteria. Their \\nsize ranges from 10 nm - 250 nm. The size of viruses is determined by electron \\nmicroscopy, ultra centrifugation and by filtration through colloid ion membrane of known \\npore diameter. \\nThe smallest virus is coliphage F2 measuring about 2 nm. \\nThe smallest plant virus is satellite tobacco necrosis virus measuring 17nm. \\nThe longest known plant virus is citrus tristeza virus-rod shaped measuring \\n2000 x 12 nm. \\nFoot and mouth virus of cattle is the smallest animal virus measuring about \\n10 nm. \\nPox viruses are the largest and most complex animal viruses. \\nParrot fever virus measuring 400 nm. \\nStructure of Viruses \\nThe intact virus unit or infectious particle is called the virion. Each virion consists \\nof a nucleic acid core surrounded by a protein coat (capsid) to form the nucleocapsid. \\nThe nucleocapsid may be naked or may be surrounded by a loose membranous envelope. \\nIt is composed of a number of subunits called capsomeres. The capsid protects the nucleic \\nacid core against the action of nucleases. Structurally viruses occur in three main shapes \\nviz. spherical or polyhedral, cylindrical or helical and the complex type.110 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nV;ruses occur In \\'i ma;n shapes \\nSpherical or \\nPOI[hedral \\nCylindrical \\nor h lical \\nNaked capsids \\neg.-Poliovirus, \\nAdenovirus, \\nPapilloma virus \\nEnveloped \\ncapsids eg.\\xad\\nHerpes simplex \\nvirus \\nNaked capsids e.g \\nBacteriophage \\nM13, TMV \\n(I) POLYHEDRAL (ICOSAHEDRAL) SYMMETRY \\nComplex \\nNo clearly identifiable \\ncapsid e.g.-vaccinia virus \\ncapsids to which other \\nstructures are attached \\ne.g.-some bacteriophage \\nEnveloped \\ncapsids ego \\nInfluenza virus \\nCrick & Watson have shown that the polyhedral capsids can nave three possible \\ntypes of symmetry viz.

Each capsomere is composed of a few \\nmonomers which form polygonal rings, each with a central space of up to 40 AO. The \\nmonomers are the structural units and are made up of one or more polypeptide chains. \\nThere are two types of capsomeres : \\n(i) Pentamers or pentagonal capsomere is made up of 5 monomers. \\n(ii) Hexamers or hexagonal capsomere consist of 6 monomers. \\nNo. of Capsomeres \\n12 \\n32 \\n72 \\n92 \\n162 \\n252 \\n812 \\nTABLE 1 \\nExample \\n¢ x 174 \\nTurnip yellow mosaic virus & poliovirus \\nPolyoma virus, Papilloma virus \\nReovirus \\nHerpes virus \\nAdenovirus \\nTipula irridescent virusVIRUSES 111 \\nThe monomers are held tog~ther by bonds, each monomers having bonds with two \\nneighbouring monomers.

The monomers curve into a helix because they are thicker at one end than the \\nother. Helical capsids may be naked (e.g. the tobacco mosaic virus) or surrounded by \\nan envelope (e.g. influenza virus). \\nTobacco Mosaic Virus \\nVirus is rod shaped about 300 nm x 15-18 nm in diameter. X-ray diffraction studies \\nhave shown that the virus consists of a protein tube with a lumen of 20 A 0 enclosing \\na single strand of helically coiled RNA. The tube is made up of a number of identical \\nsub units (monomers) of proteins arranged in a helical manner. Studies by Franklin and \\nher co-workers have shown that there are 49 subunits of protein for three turns of the \\nhelix, thus giving a total of 2,130 subunits for the rod. Each subunit has a molecular \\nweight of 17, 500 and consist of single poly chain made up of 158 amino acids.TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe RNA is a single stranded moleculer coiled into a helix 80Ao in diameter. It \\nfollows the pitch of the protein helix. Each tum of RNA helix contains about 49 \\nnucleotides with a pitch of 23°. \\n(III) COMPLEX SYMMETRY \\nComplex viruses are divided into two groups: \\n(a) Those without identifiable capsids. \\n(b) Those with capsids to which are attached additional structures. \\nVaccinia virus is an example of a virus without a definite capsid. The nucleic acid \\nis surrounded by several coats. \\nBacteriophages are the virus that infect bacteria, was discovered independently by \\nFrederick. Twort in England 1915 and by Felix d\\' Herelle at the Pasteur Institute in \\nParis in 1917. D\\'Herelle noted that something was dissolving or lysing their bacterial \\ncultures of Staphylococci and this lytic effect could be transmitted from colony to colony. \\nEven high dilution of material from a lysed colony that had been passed through a \\nbacterial filter could transmit the lytic effect. However heating the filterate destroyed \\nits lytic properties. And this lytic phenomenon is commonly called as Twort-d\\'Herelle \\nphenomenon. \\nIn nature \\'Phages\\' occur commonly in close association with bacteria. They play \\nan important role in the transmission of genetic information between bacteria by \\ntransduction process. Bacteriophages provide the only convenient model to study the \\nvirus-host interaction at cellular and molecular levels. \\nAll most every group of bacteria is attacked by one or other phage. But E.coli has \\nbeen studied most extensively from this point of view. Bacteriophage attacking E.coli \\nare called coliphages and are designated T type. These were numbered Tl, T2, T3 ...•.... Tl7 \\nby Max Delbruck (1938). The best known and most thoroughly studied are T2, T4, T6 \\nwhich are collectively called T -even phages. T 3\\' T s are called T -odd phages. \\nThere are two main types of bacterial viruses, lytic or virulent and temperate or \\navirulent. When lytic phages infect cells, the cells respond by producing large number \\nof new viruses. That is at the end of the incubation period the host cell bursts or lyses, \\nreleasing new phages to infect other host cells. This is called a lytic cycle. In the temperate \\ntype of infection, the result is not so readily apparent. The viral nucleic acid is carried \\nand replicated in the host bacterial cells from one generation to another without any \\ncell lysis. \\nBacterial viruses may be grouped into six morphological types: \\nA = This is most complex type has a hexagonal head, a rigid tail with a contractile \\nsheath and tail fibers. e.g. T 2\\' T 4\\' T 6 (T -even). \\nB = Similar to A, this type has a hexagonal head. However it lacks a contractile \\nsheath, its tail is flexible and it mayor may not have tail fibers. ego Coliphages \\nlike Tl and Ts. \\nC = This type is characterized by a hexagonal head and a tail shorter than the \\nhead. The tail has no contractile sheath and mayor may not have tail fibers. \\nego Coliphage T 3 and T TVIRUSES 113 \\nD = This type has a head made up of large capsomeres, but has no tail ego \\nColiphages, <I> x 174, 513, \\nE = This type of head made up of small capsomeres but has no tail ego Coliphages \\nF2, M5 2· \\nF = This type is filamentous. ego Coliphages Fd, FI. \\nG = Pleomorphic, no detectable capsid, envelope contain lipid ego MV - L2. \\nType A,B,C show morphology unique to bacteriophages. The morphological types \\nin groups D and E are found in plant and animal (including insect) virus. The filamentous \\nform of group F is found in some plant viruses. \\nBacteriophages of the T-even Series (T2\\' T 4, T 6) \\nIt is an example of complex viruses with capsids and attached structures. T4 \\nbacteriophage is tadpole shaped, with head and tail regions. Head capsid is 95 x 65 \\nnm and has the form of a prolate icosahedron. It is made up of about 2,000 similar \\nsubunits and is packed with circular double stranded DNA (500 nm long). Head capsid \\nconsist of two 10-faceted equatorial bands with a pyramidal vertex at either end. The \\ntail has helical symmetry. Thus the bacteriophage shows a combination of icosahedral \\nsymmetry and helical symmetry (binal symmetry). \\nThe tail consist of a core tube 80A o in diameter, through which DNA passes out \\nsurrounded by a protein tail sheath. The sheath consists of 144 subunits arranged in \\n24 rings of 6 subunits each. The sheath is connected to a thin disc, called the collar \\nat the upper end and a base plate at the lower end. The base plate is hexagonal and \\nhas a pen or spike at each corner. From each of the six corners is also given off a long, \\nthin tail fibre. 1300A 0 long, which serves for the attachment of the bacteriophage to \\nthe host cell. \\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION \\nThe intact virus unit or infectious particle is called the virion. Each virion consist \\nof a nucleic acid core surrounded by a protein coat (capsid) to form the nucleocapsid. \\nSome icosahedral and helical animal viruses, plant viruses and bacteriophage are \\nsurrounded by a membranous envelope 100-150 AO thick. \\nThe envelop resembles the typical biological membrane in consisting of a \\nphospholipids bilayer in which are embedded proteins. It has spikes which are composed \\nof glycoproteins. Viral envelop contain host cell protein as well as protein specified by \\nthe virus. Carbohydrate in enveloped virus are only found as glycoproteins but also \\nas glycolipids. Lipid in virus envelop are derived from the host cell. This is shown by \\nthe fact that (i) virus rarely have lipids not found in host cells. (ii) when viruses are \\ngrown in different host cells they show differences in their lipid pattern (iii) Radioactively \\nlabelled cellular lipids are incorporated intavirions. The different lipid are phospholipid, \\ncholesterol, fatty acid etc.114 \\n~\"\"\"\"\" \" \\'1 \\n: I \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I \\n• J \\n...... \"II \\nlilt, ... \" \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I I I \\nI I \\n• I \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I \\nIi \\n: I \\nI\\' \\nI\\' • • I I I I \\nI I \\nI I \\n• I I\\' \\n• I I I \\nI I \\n• I \\nA \\n,\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'\\' ... \\nttl\\' ....... \\nI I I I I I I I \\nI I \\n\"\\'... \",~ t.f I. \\n• I • • • • • • : . • I \\nI \\n: \\nI \\nI \\n• I I I \\nI\\' \\nB \\n,-. \" ...... \\n\" \"\\'\" \\n• I • I I • \\n• • I I \\n\\'... ,J \\n\"\", .. f\\'\" \\ni : : \\nI \\nf • I \\nI \\nI \\nI \\nII I I .. \\nI \\nc \\n..... . . ... ., . \\nJ : \\n•. . ... ..... \\no \\n..... ,.\\' \", I I I I \\nI I \\n\\'. ..\\' ...... fI\\' \\nE \\nTEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nF \\nG \\nFig. 2 Structure of T4 bacteriophage and structure of various \\nmorphological forms of Bacterial virusesVIRUSES 115 \\nVIRAL GENOME \\nIt contains all genetic information.

They do not show any metabolic activity except \\n(multiplication) self-duplication that too only within the host cytoplasm. Viruses require \\nspecific host cells for their multiplication. \\nTwo different types of life cycles are exhibited by bacteriophage, virulent or lytic \\ncycle and temperate or lysogenic cycle. In the former the intracellular phage multiplication \\nresults in the lyses or disintegration of the cell of the host bacterium and then final \\nrelease of the progeny virions. In later no harm is caused to the cell of the host bacterium \\nand the nucleic acid of the virus is first inserted in the bacterial (host) DNA and then \\nreplicates along with bacterial DNA. Bacteria containing prophages are called lysogenic \\nbacteria and those viruses whose nucleic acid can become prophage (i.e. gets incorporated \\nin bacterial DNA) are known as lysogenic, temperate or avirulent phages (eg. F2, M 12). \\nLytic or Virulent Cycle \\nThe major events involved in the lytic cycle of T -even phages are: \\n(1) Attachment of phage particle to the host. \\n(2) Adsorption of virus particle. \\n(3) Penetration into the host. \\n(4) Replication of viral nucleic acid. \\n(5) Protein synthesis. \\n(6) Assembly of new virions. \\n(7) Release of mature viruses \\n(1) Attachment to the host: Random collision brings the phage particles in contact \\nwith the bacterial cells. The tail plate of the phage attaches to the surface of a susceptible \\nhost bacterium along with tail fibres. Specific components of the protein capsid are \\nknown to be involved in the process of attachment of the virus to a specific receptor \\nsites of the host bacterial cell. In E.coli such sites are located in outer lipoprotein layer \\nof peptidoglycan layer. \\n(2) Adsorption: When the contact is made between tail fibres and bacterium, it \\nbecomes unfolded from the tail. Unfolding and release of tail fibres from whiskers are \\ngoverned by certain co-factors for ego tryptophan is needed (1 mgl ml). The whole process \\nof interaction of phage to recognition of specific receptor site is known as landing (A) \\nAfter landing there starts the second process of adsorption which is known as pinning \\n(B). Before pinning the phage can move attached with tips of tail fibres to cell surface \\nuntil it finds the site for pinning of spikes. Pinning is the irreversible process. All the \\nactivities before pining are reversible.VIRUSES 121 \\nAfter pinning the tail sheath contracts and therefore, appears shorter and thicker \\n(C). Sheath contracts by rearrangement of discs from 24 to 12. The phage uses its energy \\nin tail contraction as ATP. The activity of phage contraction is comparable to that of \\nmicrosyringe (D). The base plate through the centre enlarges after contraction of sheath. \\nAfter making the contact with a component of plasma membrane, unplugging of phage \\nDNA begins (E). Thereafter, DNA is injected into the cell without requiring metabolic \\nenergy. (F) Phage head and tail remain outside the cell. Such empty protein coats are \\nknown as \\'ghosts\\'. \\nThe adsorption of the virus particles is a specific process for which the presence \\nof some cations is necessary. Both cells and virus particles are negatively charged at \\npH 7 and positive ions are therefore required as counter ions. The second stage involves \\nthe interaction of virus particles with specific receptor most of w~ich appears to be \\nglycoproteins. The number of virus particles or infectious units adsorbed per cell is \\nreferred to as the multiplicity of infection (moi). Animal cells are usually capable to \\nadsorbing very large amounts of virus, the number of receptors of most viruses ranges \\nfrom 100,000 - SOO,OOO/cells. \\n(3) Penetration into the host: Adsorption is followed by penetration of nucleic acid \\nof the phage into the bacterial cell. Actually it is like an injection through a syringe. \\nThe end plate and the tail fibres are held firmly against the bacterial cell. It causes \\nthe hollow core of the phage tail to pierce through the bacterial cell wall and possibly \\nthe plasma membrane. At this stage the contractile tail sheath functions like a muscle. \\nIt derives the energy from ATP present in the tail of the phage. Through the hollow \\ncore of the contracted tail the phage DNA is injected or penetrated into the body of \\nthe bacterium. Lysozyme, present on the phage tail, may also facilitate the DNA \\npenetration by producing a hole on the bacterial wall. After the completion of the \\npenetration process. The empty head and the tail of the phage remain outside the \\nbacterium as the empty shell. Such empty shells are called ghosts. \\n(4) Replication of viral nucleic acids: Successful penetration of DNA will result \\nin the production of its many replicas. Enzyme are also involved in the replication of \\nnucleic acid. This replication in the double stranded DNA viruses occur in the nuclear \\nmaterial of the host cell, so does the transcription. Replication process causes several \\nchanges in the metabolism of the host cell. \\n(5) Protein synthesis: The phage nucleic acid, once inside the bacterial cell, takes \\nover the protein synthesis machinery of the cell. It suppresses the synthesis of bacterial \\nprotein and directs the metabolism of the cell to synthesize the proteins of the phage \\nparticle. This is accomplished by the synthesis of viral specific m-RNA. The replication \\nof phage DNA follows the semi conservative mechanism. Most of the phage DNA serves \\nas a template in its own synthesis and the rest is used as a template for the synthesis \\nof viral specific m-RNA. The later directs the host cell to synthesize proteins which are \\nused as a subunits (capsomeres) of the protein coat of the phage particle. These protein \\nare called late proteins as mentioned above. After the penetration of phage DNA some \\nenzyme are first synthesized. These enzymes are necessary for building complex \\nmolecule peculiar to the phage, and represent early proteins. Subsequently, late proteins \\nappear, which include the protein subunits of head and tail of the bacteriophage.122 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(6) Assembly of new virions: The DNA of phage and proteins of its head and \\ntail are synthesize separately in the bacterial cell. The phage DNA is condensed into \\na compact polyhedron and packaged into the head. Finally the tail structures are added \\nand thus new virion is assembled. The process of assembly of different components \\nof the phage into the new mature virions is called \\'maturation\\' process on \\'morphogenesis \\nprocess\\'. \\n(7) Release of mature viruses: It is the final step of infection cycle. The entire \\ncycle of phage development is completed in 30-90 min. In an infected bacterium 7-\\n8 phage particles are formed/minute and a total of about 200 phages are formed in \\na bacterium. During the process of phage replication the bacterial cell wall is weakend. \\nIt is facilitated by the enzyme lysozyme, secreted by the phage DNA in the host cell. \\nThis enzyme causes the lysis or bursting of cell wall.

The interferon first marketed under \\nthe trade name was \\'Intron\\'. \\n000BACTERIAL VIRUSES \\nViruses that use bacterial cells as hosts are called bacteriophages. There is hardly \\na single species of bacteria where sufficient investigation has not found a phage. The \\npresence of bacteriophage is recognized by the appearance of \\'plaques\\' or lytic holes in \\na continuous bacterial lawn. Phage nucliec acid occurs either as double or single stranded \\nnucleic DNA or as a double or single stranded RNA. \\nFILAMENTOUS SINGLE-STRANDED DNA BACI\\'ERIAL VIRUSES \\nThe filamentous DNA phages, which have helical rather than icosahedral symmetry, \\nthe most studied member of this group is phage M13, which infects Escherichia coli, but \\nrelated phages include f1 and fd. As with the small RNA bacteriophages, these filamentous \\nDNA phages infect only conjugational donor cells, entering after attachment to the pilus. \\nEven though these phages are linear (filamentous) in shape, like ell X174 they possess \\ncircular single-stranded DNA. \\nPhage M13 \\nPhage M13 is the model filamentous bacteriophages. The phage has found extensive \\nuse as a cloning vector and DNA-sequencing vehicle in genetic engineering. The virion \\nof phage M13 is only 6 nm in diameter but is 860 nm long. These filamentous DNA phages \\nhave the additional interesting property of being released from the cell without lysing \\nthe host cell. Thus, a cell infected with phage M13 can continue to grow, all the while \\nreleasing virions. Virus infection causes a slowing of cell growth, but otherwise a cell \\nis able to coexist with its virus. Typical plaques are thus not observed; instead, only areas \\nof reduced turbidity occur within a bacterial lawn. \\nMany aspects of DNA replication in filamentous phages are similar to those of <l> X174. \\nThe property of release without cell killing occurs by budding. In this mechanism, theBACTERIAL VIRUSES 125 \\nend of the virion containing several copies of a protein known as the A-protein is released \\nfirst, with the remainder of the virion. With phage M13 there is no accumulation of \\nintracellular virions as with typical bacteriophages. Instead, the assembly of mature M13 \\nvirions occurs on the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane and virus assembly is \\ncoupled with the budding process. \\nSeveral features of phage M13 make it useful as a cloning and DNA sequencing \\nvehicle. First, it has single-stranded DNA, which means that sequencing can easily be \\ncarried out by the Sanger dideoxynucleotide method. Second, a double-stranded form of \\ngenomic DNA essential for cloning purposes is produced naturally when the phage \\nproduces the replicative form. Third, as long as infected cells are kept in the growing \\nstate, they can be maintained indefinitely with cloned DNA, so a continuous source of \\nthe cloned DNA is available. And finally, like phage lambda, there is an intergenic space \\nin the genome of phage M13 that does not encode proteins and can be replaced by variable \\namounts of foreign DNA. For these and other reasons, phage M13 is an important part \\nof the biotechnologist\\'s toolbox. \\nBACTERIAL VIRUS T4 \\nThe first viruses to be studied in any detail were a number of bacteriophages with \\nlinear, double-stranded DNA genomes that infect Escherichia coli and a number of related \\nBacteria. Virologists began isolating and studying these viruses as model systems for \\nvirus replication and used them to establish many of the fundamental principles of \\nmolecular biology and genetics. These phages were given designations of Tl, T2 and so \\non upto TT \\nBacteriophages T2, T4, and T6 are closely related viruses, but T4 is the most \\nextensively studied. The virion of phage T4 is structurally complex. It consists of an \\nelongated icosahedral head whose overall dimensions are 85 x 110 nm. To this head is \\nattached a complex tail consisting of a helical tube (25 x 110 nm) to which are connected \\na sheath, a connecting \"neck\" with \"collar\", and a complex end plate, to which are \\nattached long, jointed tail fibers. Altogether, the virus contain over 25 distinct types of \\nstructural proteins. \\nThe length of DNA contained in these bacteriophages is only about 6% that contained \\nin E.coli. The bacteriophages has enough DNA for over 100 genes. The genome of T4 is \\na double-stranded linear DNA molecule of 168,903 base pairs. The T4 genome encodes \\nover 250 different proteins, and although no known virus encodes its own translational \\napparatus, T4 does encode several of its own tRNAs . While the T4 genome has a unique \\nlinear sequence, the genome in one virion may not be exactly the same as that of another. \\nThis is because the DNA of phage T4 is circularly permuted. Molecules that are circularly \\npermuted appear to have been linearized by opening a circle, but at different locations. \\nIn addition to circular permutation, the DNA in each T4 virion has repeated sequences \\nat each end called terminal repeats of about 3-6 kbp. Both of these factors affect genome \\npackaging. \\nThe terminally redundant T4 DNA infecting a single host cell is first replicated as \\na unit, and then several genomic units are recombined end-to-end to form a long DNA126 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nmolecule called a concatemer. The packaging mechanism of T4 DNA involves cutting a \\nsegment of DNA from the concatemer sufficient to fill a phage head (at least one genomic \\nequivalent) rather than cutting the DNA at a specific sequence. Since the T4 head holds \\nslightly more than a genome length, this \\'headful mechanism\\' leads to circular permutation \\nand terminal redundancy. T4 DNA contains the modified base 5-hydroxymethy1cystosine \\ninstead of cytosine. It is these residues that are glucosylated and DNA with this \\nmodification is resistant to virtually all known restriction enzymes. Consequently, the \\nincoming T4 DNA is well protected from host defenses. The multiplication cycle of these \\nphages like that all viruses (as mentioned in chap 9) can be divided into five distinct \\nstages viz. attachment, penetration, biosynthesis, maturation and release. \\nMultiplication in T4 Phage \\nThings happen rapidly in a T4 infection. \\nEarly in infection T4 directs the synthesis of its \\nown RNA and also begins to replicate its unique \\nDNA. About 1 minute after attachment and \\npenetration of the host by T4 DNA, the synthesis \\nof host DNA and RNA ceases, while transcription \\nof specific phage genes begins. Translation of \\nviral mRNA begins soon after, and within 4 \\nminutes of infection, phage DNA replication has , . \\nbegun. \\nThe T4 genome can be divided into three \\nparts, encoding early proteins, middle proteins, \\nand late proteins, respectively. The early and \\nmiddle proteins are primarily enzymes involved \\nin DNA replication and transcription, while the \\nlate proteins are the head and tail proteins and \\nthe enzymes involved in liberating the mature \\nphage particles from the cell. \\nAlthough T4 has a very large genome for a \\nvirus, it does not encode its own RNA polymerase. \\nThe control of T4 mRNA synthesis involves the \\n65 nm \\nFig. 1 : T-even bacteriophage \\nproduction of proteins that sequentially modify the specificity of the host RNA polymerase \\nso that it recognizes phage promoters. The early promoters are read directly by the host \\nRNA polymerase and involve the function of host sigma factor. Host transcription is shut \\ndown shortly thereafter by a phage encoded anti-sigma factor that binds to host CJ70 and \\ninterferes with its recognition of host promoters. \\nPhage-specific proteins synthesized from the early genes also carry out covalent \\nmodifications on the host RNA polymerase (l subunits and a few phage-encoded proteins \\nalso bind to the polymerase. These modifications change the specificity of the polymerase \\nso that it now recognizes T4 middle promoters. One of the T4 early proteins, called MotA, \\nrecognizes a particular DNA sequence in middle promoters and guides RNA polymeraseBACTERIAL VIRUSES 127 \\nto these sites. Transcription from the late promoters requires a new T4- encoded sigma \\nfactor. Sequential modification of host cell RNA polymerase as described here for phage \\nT4 is used to regulate gene expression by many other bacteriophages as well. \\nT4 encodes over 20 new proteins that are synthesized early aft.er infection. These \\ninclude enzymes for the synthesis of the unusual base 5-hydroxymethykytosine and for \\nits glucoslyation, as well as an enzyme that degrades the normal DNA precursor \\ndeoxycytidine triphosphate. In addition, T4 encodes a number of enzymes that have \\nfunctions similar to those of host enzymes in DNA replication but that are formed in larger \\namounts, thus permitting faster synthesis of T4 specific DNA. Additional early proteins \\ninclude those involved in the processing of newly replicated phage DNA. \\nMost of the late genes encode structural proteins for the virion, including those for \\nthe head and tail. Assembly of heads and tails occurs independently; DNA is packaged \\ninto the assembled head and the tail and tail fibers are added later. Exit of the virus from \\nthe cell occurs as a result of cell lysis. The phage codes for a lytic enzyme, T4 lysozyme, \\nwhich attacks the peptidoglycan of the host cell. After a lytic cycle, which takes only about \\n25 min, over 100 new virions will be released from each host cell, which itself has now \\nbeen almost completely destroyed. The various stages involved in the multiplication of \\nphages can be demonstrated experimentally in what is known as a one-step growth \\nexperiment. In this procedure, a phage suspension is diluted until a sample containing \\nonly a few phage particles is obtained. These particles are then introduced into a culture \\nof host cells. Periodically samples of phage particles are removed from the culture are \\ninoculated into a plate culture of susceptible host cells, the plaque method is used to \\ndetermine the number of infective phage particles on this culture. A few minutes after \\nattachment no infective particles are present. However phage nucleic acid is found inside \\nthe infected cells and capsid proteins will be synthesized. The time required for maturation \\nis the interval between the appearance of phage nucleic acid and the synthesiS of mature \\nphages. After few minutes the number of infective phage particles found in sub cultures \\nbegins to rise. The burst size is determined once the number of infective phage particles \\nremains constant indicating that no further phage multiplication will occur. \\nTEMPERATE BACTERIOPHAGES \\nBacteriophages T4 is virulent. However, some other viruses, although also able to \\nkill cells through a lytic cycle, have the option of undergoing a different life cycle resulting \\nin a stable genetic relationship with the host. Such viruses are called temperate viruses. \\nThese viruses can enter into a state called lyosgeny, where most virus genes are not \\nexpressed and the virus genome, called a prophage, is replicated in synchrony with the \\nhost chromosome. \\nThe temperate phage genome can be replicated along with that of the host and during \\ncell division be passed from one generation to the next. Under certain conditions cells that \\nharbor a temperate virus, called lysogens, can spontaneously produce and release virions. \\nLysogeny is probably of ecological importance because most bacteria isolated from \\nnature are lysogens for one or more bacteriophages. Lysogeny can also confer new genetic \\nproperties on the bacterial cell. \\nIn a typical lytic virus it is not the presence (or even the replication) of viral DNA128 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nthat leads to the production of new virions and host cell death. Rather it is expression \\nof the viral genome that is deleterious. Host cells can harbor viral genomes without harm \\nif the expression of the viral genes can be controlled. This is the situation found in \\nlysogens. However, if this control is lost, the virus enters the lytic pathway and produces \\nnew virions, eventually lysing the host cell. Lysogeny can thus be considered a genetic \\ntrait of a bacterial strain. \\nThe temperate virus does not exist in its extracellular form inside of the cell. Instead, \\nthe prophage is integrated into the bacterial chromosome and replicates along with the \\nhost cell as long as the genes controlling its lytic pathway are not expressed. Typically \\nthis control is maintained by a phage-encoded repressor protein (the gene encoding the \\nrepressor protein is expressed). The virus repressor protein not only controls the lytic genes \\non the prophage but also prevents the expression of any incoming genes of the same virus. \\nThis results in the lysogens having immunity to infection by the same type of virus. \\nIf the phage repressor is inactivated or if its synthesis is prevented, the prophage \\nis induced. Induction results in the production of new virions and the lysis of the host \\ncell. In some cases, induction can be brought about by environmental conditions. If the \\nvirus loses the ability to leave the host genome (because of mutation), it becomes a cryptic \\nvirus. Genomic studies have shown that many bacterial chromosomes contain DNA \\nsequences that were clearly once part of a viral genome. Thus the establishment and \\nbreakdown of the lysogenic state is likely a dynamic process in prokaryotes. \\nBACTERIOPHAGE LAMBDA OR A. PHAGE \\nOne of the best-studied temperate phages is lambda, which infects Escherichia coli. \\nMorphologically, lambda virions look like those of many other tailed bacteriophages\" \\nalthough unlike phage T4, no tail fibers are present. The genome of lambda consists of \\na linear double-stranded DNA molecule, but at the 5\\' terminus of each of the strands \\nis a single-stranded tail 12 nucleotides long. These single-stranded ends are complementary \\n(the ends of the DNA are said to be cohesive). Thus, when the two\\' ends of the DNA \\nare free in the host cell they associate (the cos site), and the DNA is ligated to form a \\ndouble-stranded circle of 48,502 base pairs. \\nLambda Infection and the Lytic Pathway \\nThe lambda virion attaches to a specific receptor protein in the cell wall of Escherichia \\ncoli and injects its DNA. The DNA circularizes almost immediately and expression of the \\nphage genome begins. The first steps in gene expression are the same whether the final \\nresult is lysis or lysogeny. This replication shows an interesting example of molecular level \\ncontrol of gene expression. The completion of rightward transcription of the phage genome \\nrequires the expression of Q gene expression. The complete counter clock wise transcription \\nof the lambda genome requires the expression of the N gene that codes for an N protein. \\nBoth the N and Q genes must be expressed for the transcription of the complete genome. \\nThe A. phage genome contains a a gene which codes for a repressor protein that binds \\nto the operator that controls the expression of N protein. In the absence of N protein synthesis \\nthe replication of A. phage DNA can\\'t proceed. The repressor protein also binds to another \\noperator region, blocking the rightward transcription of the A. phage DNA and thus theBACTERIAL VIRUSES 129 \\nproduction of Q protein. This leads to a conversion to lysogenic replication. During the \\nlytic replication cycle of A, transcription begins at two promoter sites during early replication \\none of the promoter site initiates rightward transcription Pl\\\\ the other initiates left ward \\ntranscription PL\\' Production of RNA using host RNA polymerase begins at two key \\npromoters called P L (promoter left) and P R (promoter right). These yield short transcripts \\nthat are translated to give the products of the N and the cro genes, both proteins being \\ninvolved in regulatory events. The ero protein regulates whether the lytic or the lysogenic \\npathway is followed. The N protein is an antitenninator that allows that RNA polymerase \\nto transcribe past specific terminators, extending the transcripts from P Land P R\\' These longer \\ntranscripts can be translated to yield more proteins, including the products of the cII and \\ncIII genes. The N protein is not completely effective at the terminator before the Q gene, \\nand so only a small amount of the Q protein is made. \\nLambda \\nvirion \\nFig. 2 : The lambda genome130 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe Q protein is also an antiterminator protein. If its concentration becomes high \\nenough, it will allow the transcript from a nearby promoter to synthesize the transcript \\nlabeled R2. This transcript is translated to yield the late proteins, all the necessary \\nstructural proteins to construct a virion, and the proteins necessary for cell lysis. However, \\nat the same time the Q protein is accumulating, the Cro protein also reaches levels where \\nit can block transcription from both P L and P R by binding to both 0L (operator left) and \\nOR (operator right). Therefore, Cro functions as a repressor protein. \\nIn the mechanism of Cro protein binding to OR is observed that there are three similar \\nbut non identical sites at this operator where the Cro protein can bind. It does so first \\nat site 3, and then site 2, and only when those two sites are filled, at site 1 once P Land \\nonce P R are blocked, no more cII or cIII proteins can be synthesized. These proteins are \\nneeded to enter the lysogenic pathway. Thus, when Cro is made in high amounts, lambda \\nis irreversibly commited to the lytic pathway. \\nThe shut off of P L and P R results in a change of lambda DNA replication. Early DNA \\nsynthesis is bidirectional from a single origin and gives rise to typical theta-like intermediates. \\nHowever, by the time late proteins are being made, long, linear concatamer of DNA are \\nsynthesized by rolling circle replication. In this mechanism and unlike semi conservative \\nreplication, replication proceeds in only one direction and can result in very long chains \\nof replicated DNA. Rolling circle replication permits rapid DNA replication and thus is \\na useful mechanism for rapidly accumulating copies of the lambda genome to package into \\nmature virions. The long concatemers are cut into virus-sized lengths by a DNA-cutting \\nenzyme. In the case of lambda, the cutting enzyme cuts at specific sites on the two strands \\n(the cos sites), 12 nucleotides apart, providing the cohesive ends involved in the cyclization \\nprocess. The linear DNA is then packaged into phage heads and the tails and other proteins \\nadded. The cell is then lysed by the activity of phage-encoded enzym~, and the lambda \\nlytic cycle is complete. In a nutshell, If Cro dominates regulatory events, the outcome is lysis, \\nwhile if the lambda repressor dominates, lysogeny will occur. \\nLysogeny \\nfavored \\nInfection \\nP L activated ..

DNA in E. coli Chromosome \\nIntegration of lambda DNA occurs at a unique site on the Escherichia coli chromosome \\n& is required to complete the lysogenic state. Integration occurs by insertion of the virus \\ngenome into the host genome (thus effectively lengthening the host genome by the length \\nof the virus DNA) upon injection, the cohesive ends of the linear lambda molecule find \\neach other and form a circle, and it is thus circular DNA that becomes integrated into \\nthe host genome (the site created when these ends join is called cos). To establish lysogeny, \\ngenes cI (lambda repressor) and int (encoding integrase) must be expressed. The integration \\nprocess requires lambda integrase, which is a site-specific nuclease/integrase-catalyzing \\nrecombination of the phage and bacterial attachment sites. The int gene has a promoter \\nthat, like P E\\' is activated by the cII protein. \\nBACTERIAL VIRUS T7 \\nBacteriophage T7, a representative T-odd phage, has a small linear double-stranded \\nDNA genome. The DNA is injected linearly into bacterial cells after the phage attaches \\nto a host cell, most commonly E. coli. Transcription of the T7 genome begins immediately \\nafter penetration. Host cell RNA polymerase initiates RNA synthesis at closely spaced \\npromoters of the phage DNA end. Host RNA polymerase is used to copy the first few \\nphage genes, called early genes. It also makes mRNA for the phage-specific RNA \\npolymerase that is used in the major RNA transcription process that occurs during \\nreplication of this phage. \\n;§ \\niii iii i i \\n12 13 14 1516 17 18 19 0.30.7 1 1.11.3 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 \\n--------... --------... --------... • • • • • Early mRNAs \\nFig. 4 : Linear genome of T7 bacteriophage \\nTranscription generates a set of overlapping polygenic mRNA molecules. These \\nmRNA molecules are then cut by a host-specified RNaseIII that acts at several sites. This \\ngenerates smaller mRNA molecules that code for one to four proteins each. One of these \\nproteins is an RNA polymerase that copies double-stranded DNA. Two others code for \\nproteins that stop host RNA polymerase action. This turns off early gene transcription \\nand translation of host genes.132 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe T7 phage strongly affects host transcription and translation processes by \\nproducing proteins that tum off transcription of host genes. This phage has genes co~ling \\nfor enzymes that degrade host cell DNA. Nucleotides from degraded DNA are incorporated \\ninto phage progeny. Late genes expressed, beginning 6 minutes after infection, code for \\nenzymes involved in DNA replication. Regulation of T7 gene expression is both positive \\nand negative. Negative control is by means of the formation of proteins that stop host \\nRNA polymerase and shut off early T7 gene transcription. Positive control is by the \\nformation of new RNA polymerase that recognizes the rest of the T7 promoters. \\nA structural feature of T7 DNA that is important for its replication is a direct terminal \\nrepeat of 160 bp at both ends of the molecule. To replicate DNA near the 5\\' terminus, \\nRNA primer molecules have to be removed before replication is complete. There is thus \\nan unreplicated portion of the T7 DNA at the 5\\' -terminus of each strand. Genetic elements \\ncomposed of linear DNA employ various strategies for solving this problem in DNA \\nreplication. The strategy employed by T7 is similar to that used by T4 and involves the \\nrepeated sequence at its ends. The opposite single 3\\' -strands on two separate DNA \\nmolecules, being complementary, can pair with these 5\\' -strands, forming a DNA molecule \\ntwice as long as the original T7 DNA. The unreplicated portions of this structure are \\nthen completed through the activity of T7 DNA polymerase and ligase, resulting in a linear \\nbirnolecule called a concatemer. \\nContinued replication & recombination can lead to concatemers of considerable \\nlength, but ultimately a phage-encoded endonuclease cuts each concatemer at a specific \\nsite, resulting in the formation of virus-sized linear DNA molecules with terminal repeats. \\nBecause T7, like lambda but unlike T4, cuts the concatemer at specific sequences, the DNA \\nsequence in each T7 virion is identical. This is not the case in phage T4. This phage \\nprocesses DNA using a \\'headful mechanism\\', which means that its DNA is not only \\nterminally redundant but is also circularly permuted. \\nMU: A DOUBLE-STRANDED TRANSPOSABLE DNA BACTERIAL VIRUS \\nOne of the more interesting bacteriophages is phage Mu. This virus is temperate, \\nlike lambda, but has the unusual property of replicating as a transposable element. This \\nphage is called Mu because term Mu stands for mutator phage inducing mutations in \\na host genome into which it becomes integrated. The mutagenic property of Mu arises \\nbecause the genome of the virus can be inserted within host genes, thus inactivating them. \\nHence, a host cell that has become infected with Mu can assume a mutant phenotype. \\nMu is a useful phage in bacterial genetics because it can be used to easily generate a \\nwide variety of bacterial mutants. The unique property of Mu is that it contact as \\ntransposon within a host cell. Transposable elements are sequences of DNA that can move \\nfrom one location on their host genome to another as discrete genetic units. They are found \\nin both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and play important roles in genetic variation. \\nAlthough a bacteriophage, Mu is in reality a very large transposable element that replicates \\nits DNA by transposition. \\nBacteriophage Mu is a large virus with an icosahedral head, a helical tail, and \\nsix tail fibers. The genome of Mu contains linear double-stranded DNA. It can be seenBACTERIAL VIRUSES 133 \\nthat the bulk of the genes are involved in the synthesis of head and tail proteins and \\nthat important genes at each end of the genome are involved in replication and host \\nrange. \\nThe DNA in Mu is approximately 39 kbp, but only 37.2 kbp constitute the actual \\nMu genome. This is because both ends of the Mu genome contain host DNA. At the left \\nend of the Mu DNA are 50-150 bp of host DNA, and at the right end are 1-2 kbp of \\nhost DNA. These host DNA sequences are not unique but simply represent DNA adjacent \\nto the location where Mu was inserted into the genome of its previous host. \\nWhen a Mu phage virion is formed, a length of DNA containing the Mu genome \\njust large enough to fill the phage head is excised from the host. The DNA is packaged \\nuntil the head is full, but the place at the right end where the DNA is cut varies from \\none virion to another, there is a variable sequence of host DNA at the right-hand end \\nof the phage (right of the attR site). Thus, each virion arising from a single infected cell \\nwill be genetically unique, since it will have different host DNA. \\nA specific segment of the Mu genome called G is invertible, being present in the \\ngenome either in the orientation designated G+ or in the inverted orientation G. The \\norientation of this segment determines the kind of tail fibers that are present on the phage. \\n5ince adsorption to the host cell is controlled by molecular interactions between the tail \\nfibers and the cell surface, the host range of Mu is determined by which orientation of \\nthis invertible segment is present in the phage. For example, if the G segment is in the \\norientation designated G+, then the phage will make tail fibers that allow it to infect \\nEscherichia coli strain K12. By contrast, if the G segment is in the G- orientation, then the \\nphage will infect E. coli strain C or several other species of enteric bacteria. The two tail \\nfiber proteins are encoded on opposite strands within this small G segment. \\nLeft of the G segment is a promoter that directs transcription into the G segment. \\nIn the orientation G+, the promoter directing transcription of genes 5 and V is active, \\nwhereas in the orientation G-, a different promoter directs transcription of genes 5\\' and \\nV\\' on the opposite strand. Inversion of the G region is a rare event and is under the control \\nof a gene adjacent to the G region. We thus see in the inversion phenomenon is a simple \\nmechanism for attacking a variety of different host cells. \\nReplication of Mu \\nOn infection of a host cell by Mu, the DNA is injected and is protected from host \\nrestriction by a modification system in which about 15% of the adenine residues are \\nmodified by acetylation or acetoamidated. Integration requires the activity of the gene A \\nproduct, which is a transposase enzyme encoded by the phage. At the site where the Mu \\nDNA becomes integrated, a 5-bp duplication of host DNA arises at the target site. This \\nhost DNA duplication arises because staggered cuts are made at the point in the host \\ngenome where Mu is inserted. The resulting single-stranded segments are converted to \\nthe double-stranded form as part of the Mu integration process. Duplication of short \\nstretches of host DNA is typical of transposable element insertion. Mu DNA is transposed \\nto multiple site of the bacterial chromosome when Mu integrates its gene around the \\nbacterial chromosome it inserts phage DNA within bacterial genes causing mutation.134 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nPositive activator Invertible G \\nof late mRNA synthesis segment \\nRepressor Lysis H~ad and (host range) \\nIntegration tall genes .L \\nHost Variable r~ePlication .-, __ --\\'1 ___ --..;_-., DNA end \\n\\\\ \\nI (host DNA) \\n~~~ __ ~~IYs ____ ~ ( ~ \\no C / SUU\\'~J D \\nf 7 \\nattL Transposase \\n(a) \\nInsertion point: region \\nto be duplicated \\nattR \\nl I I I \\nAIAGCAGIC \\nTITCGTCIG \\n1 \\ni \\nHost \\n...----..1 DNA \\nStaggered cuts made in \\nhost DNA by transpose \\nGCCG A I Mu I AGCAGICGTT \\nGICAA I ICGGCITITCGTCI \\nG C C GAIAGCAG \\nP G G ClTI TCGTC \\n(b) \\n1 \\nConversion to single \\nstrands and insertion \\nof Mu \\nMu AGCAG ICGTT \\nTCGTclqcAA \\nRepair of DNA leads \\nto formation of five-base\\xad\\npair duplication \\nFig. 5 : Replication of bacteriophages Mu \\nLytic growth of Mu can occur either upon initial infection, if the Mu repressor (the \\nproduct of the c gene) is not formed, or by induction of a lysogen; In either case, replication \\nof Mu DNA involves repeated transposition of Mu to multiple sites on the host genome. \\nInitially, transcription of only the early genes of Mu occurs, but after the C protein is \\nexpressed (C is a positive activator of late transcription), synthesis of the Mu head and \\ntail proteins occurs. Eventually, expression of the lytic function occurs and mature phage \\nparticles are released. The lysogenic state in Mu requires the sufficient accumulation of \\nrepressor protein to prevent transcription of integrated Mu DNA. \\n000PLANT VIRUSES \\nA virus is a nucleoprotein that has the ability to cause disease. It multiplies only \\nin living cells and it is too small to be seen individually with a light microscope. All \\nviruses are parasitic in cells and cause a multitude of diseases in all forms of living \\norganisms from single celled microorganism to large plants and animals. The total number \\nof viruses known to date exceeds 2000 and new virus are described every month. About \\none fourth of all known viruses attack and cause diseases in plants. One virus may infect \\none or dozens of different species of plants and each species of plant is usually attacked \\nby many different kinds of viruses. A single plant may also be infected by more than \\none kind of virus at the same time. \\nAlthough viruses can take any of several forms, they are mostly rod or polyhedral \\nshaped or the variant of these two basic structures. The genetic material is only RNA \\nor only DNA. \\nViruses cause disease not by consuming cells or killing them with toxins, but by \\nutilizing cellular substances during multiplication, taking up space in cells and disrupting \\ncellular processes and lead to the development of abnormal substances and conditions \\ninjurious to the functions and the life of the cell or the organism. \\nMORPHOLOGY \\nMorphologically the plant viruses came in different shapes and sizes. Generally they \\nare elongate rigid rods and other are spherical like isometric or polyhedral and the \\nremaining being cylindrical bacillus like rods. Some elongated viruses are rigid rods about \\n15 x 300 nm, but most appear as long, thin, flexible threads about 10-13 x 480-2000 nm. \\nMost of the spherical viruses are polyhedral 17-60 nm. \\nMany plant viruses have split genomes, consisting of two or more distinct nucleic \\nacid strands encapsidated in different sized particles made of the same protein subunits.136 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMany isometric viruses have two or three different components of the same size but \\ncontaining nucleic acid strands of different length. \\nThe surface of viruses consist of a definite number of protein subunits which are \\nspirally arranged in the elongated viruses and packed on sides of the polyhedral particles \\nof the spherical virues. In transverse section the elongated viruses appear as hollow tubes \\nwith the protein subunits forming the outer coat and the nucleic acid, also spirally \\narranged, embedded between the inner ends of two successive spirals of the protein \\nsubunits. The rhabdoviruses and a few spherical viruses are provided with an outer \\nlipoprotein envelope or membrane. Inside the membrane is the nucleocapsid consisting \\nof nucleic acid and protein subunits. The nucleic acid makes up 5-40% of the virus protein \\nmaking up the remaining 60-95%. The spherical virus contain higher percentage of nucleic \\nacid whereas the low nucleic acid percentage is found in elongated virus. The weight \\nof nucleic acid ranges between 1-3 x 106 dalton per virus particle. Although some have \\n6 x 106 dalton. All viral nucleic acid sizes are quiet small as compared, to 0.5 x 109 dalton \\nfor mollicutes and 1.5 x 109 dalton for bacteria. \\nThe protein shell of plant viruses are composed of repeating sub-units. The amino \\nacid content and sequence for identical protein subunits of a given virus are constant \\nbut vary for different viruses and even for different strains of the same virus. The content \\nand sequences of amino acids are known for the proteins of many viruses. For example \\nthe protein subunit of TMV consist of 158 amino acids in a constant sequence with a \\nmass of 17,600 dalton. \\nThe protein subunits of TMV are arranged in a helix containing 16, 1/3 subunits \\nper turn (49 subunits per three turns). Each TMV particle consists of approximately 130 \\nhelix turn of protein subunits. The nucliec acid is packed tightly between the helices of \\nprotein subunits. In rhabdovirus the helical nucleoproteins are enveloped in a membrane. \\nIn polyhedral plant viruses the protein, subunits are tightly packed in arrangement \\nthat produce 20 facets and form a shell. In this shell the nucleic acid is folded or otherwise \\norganized. \\nThe nucleic acid of most plant viruses consists of RNA but about 80 viruses are known \\nto contain DNA. Both nucleic acid either DNA or RNA are long chain like molecules \\nconsisting of hundreds/thousands of units called nucleotides. The size of both RNA and \\nDNA is expressed either as Dalton or as the number of bases (Kb for ssRNA and DNA \\nor kilobase pairs (Kbp) for double stranded RNA and DNA. Most plant viruses contain \\n(540) ssRNA, but 40 contain dsRNA, 30 contain dsDNA and about 50 contain ssDNA. \\nSATELLITE VIRUS AND SATELLITE RNA \\nThe satellite viruses are virus that must always be associated with certain typical \\nviruses (helper viruses) because they depend upon the later for multiplication and plant \\ninfection. Satellite virus reduce the ability of the helper viruses to multiply and cause \\ndisease i.e. satellite virus act like parasites of the associated helper virus. \\nThe satellite RNA are small, linear, circular RNAs found inside the virion of certain \\nmulti component viruses. Satellite RNA\\'s are not related or only partially related to RNA \\nof the virus. These satellite RNA\\'s may increase or decrease the severiety of viral infections.PLANT VIRUSES 137 \\nVIRUS INFECTION \\nPlant viruses enter cells only through wounds, made mechanically or by vectors, or \\nby deposition into an ovule by an infected pollen grain. \\nWhen a plant is infected by virus, the virus moves from one cell to another and \\nmultiples in most of the cells. Then the virus moves from cell to cell through plasmodes\\xad\\nmata, connecting the adjacent cells. Viruses multiply in each parenchyma cells infected. \\nIn leaf parenchyma the virus moves approximately 1 mm or 8-10 cells/day. \\nMost viruses require 2-5 days to move out of an inoculated leaf. In all economically \\nimportant viral infections virus reach the phloem and transport to long distance within \\nthe plant. Once the virus entered the phloem, it moves rapidly in it towards growing region \\nlike apical meristem and other food utilizing parts of the plant like tubers and rhizome. \\nThe development of local lesion symptoms is an indication of the localization of the \\nvirus within the lesion area. In systemic symptom the virus continued to spread beyond \\nthe borders of the lesion. \\nIn systemic virus infection some viruses are limited to phloem and a few adjacent \\nparenchyma cells. Many virus leave the growing point of stems or roots of affected plants \\napparently free of virus but few virus invade all new meristem tip tissues. \\nIt appears that the diseased condition induced in plants by viruses is the result of \\ninterference and disruption of normal metabolic processes in infected parenchyma or \\nspecialized cells. This interference is caused by the mere presence and multiplication of \\nvirus and possibly by the abnormal or toxic effects of additional virus-induced protein \\nor their products (not found yet). \\nPlant virus do not contain any enzymes, toxins or other pathogenic substances and \\nyet cause a variety of symptoms on host. Viral diseases of plant are not due primarily \\nto depletion of nutrients but due to more indirect effects of virus on the metabolism of \\nplant which is due to virus induced synthesis of new proteins by the host (like enzyme) \\nand may interfere with the normal metabolism of the host. \\nViral infection generally cause a decrease in photosynthesis through decrease in \\nchlorophyll/leaf, chlorophyll efficiency and leaf area per plant. Virus generally cause a \\ndecrease in the amount of growth regulating substances in the plant frequently by \\nincreasing a growth inhibiting substances. There is a decrease in soluble nitrogen during \\nrapid virus synthesis. A chronic decrease in the levels of carbohydrate is seen in the mosaic \\ndisease. \\nThe respiration of plants is generally increased immediately after infection but after \\nthe initial increase the respiration of infected plants became lower than that of healthy \\nplant. \\nSYMPTOMS \\nThe symptoms of plant virus diseases are of major importance in the identification \\nof the virus concerned. Most virus are named on the basis of chief symptom they produce \\non the host on which they were first reported. Symptomatology was very important in \\nthe early days of virus research before any of the viruses were isolated and characterized.138 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe external symptoms provide the first clue about possible viral infection but symptoms \\nchange under different environmental, nutritional and climatic conditions. They are also \\ninfluenced by the type and strain of virus, type and variety of host plant, age and stage \\nof development of virus and pathogens. Virus like symptoms may be caused by other plant \\npathogens like viroids, phytoplasma and fastidious bacteria. \\nThe term symptoms refers to visible abnormalities in plants. These symptoms are \\nin the form of colour changes of foliage or growth abnormalities. Mostly the hosts are \\naffected systematically by the viruses and the virus persist in infected· plants throughout \\nlife. Thus in vegetatively propagated plants the virus persist throughout life and the \\nprogenies are always virus infected. \\nWhen the infection remains confined near the site of virus entry, it is called local \\ninfection, but when infection spreads slowly to surrounding cells through plasmodesmata \\nand phloem to long distance in host system is called systemic infection. The time period \\nbetween the virus entry and first appearance of symptoms is called the incubation period. \\nThe abnormality develop in all parts of infected plants, not only externally but \\ninternally as well. \\nExternal Symptoms \\nThe external symptoms produced by virus infection is divided into two broad \\ncategories, those resulting due to infection of single inoculated cells of host plant and. \\nthose which cause systemic infection where the virus moves from the site of initial infection \\nto the entire plant. \\n(a) Colour changes: The word variegation refers to all types of colour changes on \\nleaves. The mosaic symptom are characterized by mottled green (spot or blotches of colour) \\nor patterns of green and yellow areas. When yellow colour is uniform and unbroken it \\nis known as chlorosis. In graminaceous plants, the mosaic pattern may be in the form \\nof streaks and stripes. Scorching of entire leaf or its margins is burnt appearance. In vein \\nclearing the tissues close to the veins turn yellow and the remaining lamina surface stays \\ngreen. In vein banding the tissue near the veins remain green and rest of the lamina surface \\nturns yellow. Colour changes are accompanied by some structural changes of the organ. \\nPouch like development of green parts of leaves are called puckering. The drying of cell \\nin a particular fashion leads to rings pots, black spots etc. The ring spot lesion consist \\nof a central group of dead cells beyond this there develop one or more superficial concentric \\nrings of dead cells with normal green tissue between them. Viruses producing ring spot \\ntype of symptoms are mostly transmitted by soil-living organism. Ring spot patterns may \\nalso occur on other organs for example bulbs and tubers. \\n(b) Changes in growth pattern: Leaf curl is a symptom in which leaves curl from \\nthe margins backward bringing the centre of the lamina upward. In leaf roll the margins \\nroll inward froming a trough like shape with midrib in the centre of the trough. The leaves \\nbecome thick and leathery due to accumulation of starch. Galls can be formed on leaves \\nand other organs. In mosaic diseases leaves may be abnormally lobed with fern like \\nappearance forming filiform or shoe-string structures. \\nVirus infected plants may show a wide range of developmental or growth abnor-PLANT VIRUSES 139 \\nmalities. Reduction in size of leaves and shoots is a common symptom in many virus \\ndiseases. When leaves are small they give a bushy appearance to the plant. Hypertrophy \\nand hyperplasia results in bunchy top or witches broom symptom. Stem sometimes show \\na spike like growth. Spindle tuber and spindle shoots are other growth abnormalities. \\nSome virus infections produces out growth or enations from the upper or lower \\nsurface of the leaves. These outgrowth are generally associated with vein of upper and \\nlower surface. These enations may be due to abnormal cell proliferation, as a result of \\nvirus induced changes in hormone concentration. Wound tumor virus produces wart like \\nout growths on the stems and roots of infected clover plants. \\n(c) Symptom on stems and roots: The major stem symptoms due to viral infection \\nare seen in swollen stems in cacao infected with cocoa swollen shoot disease. Tumors \\nare produced on the stem of clover plants by wound tumor virus. In woody plants stem \\nsymptom appears as flaking, cracking, necrosis of bark and excessive gum formation, stem \\nsplitting and scar formation. The prominent symptom seen on roots are abnormal \\nproliferation of rootlets, reduced number of adventitious roots. In legumes the N2 fixation \\nis reduced by virus infection. \\n(d) Flower Symptoms: In flowers the virus infection produces marked changes in \\ncolour. Colour breaking symptoms are very common in the flowers of many virus-infected \\nplants. The breaking usually consists of flecks, streaks or sectors of tissue. The breaking \\nof petal colour is due to loss of anthocyanin pigments. In a few instances there may be \\nincreased pigmentation in some areas of the petals. Infected flower are frequently smaller \\nand may drop prematurely. Flowers may be reduced in size, deformed in shape and quiet \\nfrequently flowering may be reduced. This effect the yield of viable seeds. \\n(e) Abnormalities in fruits, seeds and pollen: The viral infection show colour \\nchanges in the fruits. Fruits show mottling, ring, spotting and necrotic symptoms. Fruits \\nmay be distorted and misshappened. The texture of fruits can be changed like in cucumber \\nthe wart like projections develop due to cucumber mosaic virus infection. In tomato the \\nfruits may be dwarfed, malformed and seedless due to tomato aspermy virus. Virus \\ninfection may have drastic effects on seed production like in wheat, soybean. Sometimes \\nthe seed produced are completely abortive. The pollen production and pollens from \\ninfected plants are frequently sterile or viability is reduced. \\nIn musa cultivars infected with Banana virus the fruit bunch emerges from the side \\nof pseudo-stem inspite from the top of it. \\nInternal Symptoms \\nThe external symptom induced by viruses are frequently reflected in anatomical and \\nhistological changes within the plant. Mesophyll cells are smaller and less differentiated \\nwith few or no intercellular spaces. The vascular bundle may enlarge. The chloroplast \\nis reduced and as a result the tissue may become abnormally transleucent. Large number \\nof sieve elements in companion cells develop. Necrosis resisting from phloem may spread \\nto other tissues also. The internal changes in virus affected plants can be observed by \\nlight and electron microscopy and include anatomical and histological deviation, cyto\\xad\\nlogical and ultra structural changes and formation of inclusion bodies.140 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nTabacco \\nmosaic \\nCucumber Cucumber Cucumber Apple \\nmosaic mosaic on mosaic on mosaic on \\npepper squash cucumber \\n~:t \\nSeed \\n• Tomoto Tomoto \\nspotted wilt ringspot on grape \\nBlackberry \\nsterility \\nTomoto \\naspormy \\nPlum pox \\non apricot \\nI\\n~ \\'!i;\\' \\n~I \\n.\\', ~ \\nI \\nApple Stem \\nflat limb necrosis \\nPear rough \\nbark \\nNo\\'mal_~ \\n~1.) ~~ ~ \"\\'lor; \\n~t\">i; _. ;. \\nStunting Citrus tristezo \\nI \\nElm zonete Glerry black \\ncanker canker \\nBanong Cocoa \\nbWlChy top swollen rool \\nUI\\'~\"i.r.\\\\L\\\\1 , I\\' \"\\' :. \\nl.i~1 :1:;li1 . \"\\'I\\' -, \\' J 11 JVii.1t -\\nI , \\';IJ \\' \\nMaize dwarf \\nrings pot ringspot mosaic \\nGover \\nwound tumor \\nCitrus Apple \\nwoody gall scar skin \\nCucumber \\nmosaic on \\ngladiolus bulb \\nFig. 1 : Symptoms of viral diseases of plants \\nil \\nI I ..

These changes \\nare reflected in the form of particular external symptoms. The cells may decrease in size \\n(hypotrophy) or in number (hypoplasia), or may increase in size (hypertrophy) or in \\nnumber (hyperplasia). Excessive hyperplasia leads to proliferation of tissues causing \\nwitches broom, bunchy top etc. The cells may under go necrosis or deviate in content \\nlike reduction of chloroplast causes chlorosis and nuclear swelling. \\nIn leaves showing mosaic or yellowing symptom the palisade cell may be smaller \\nwith fewer chloroplast. The yellow areas have restricted growth which leads to buckling, \\npuckering and blistering. Extreme hypertrophy of lamina give rise to shoe string leaves. \\nEnlargments of cells adjacent to veins obliterates intercellular spaces and few chloroplasts \\nare produced making the tissue transleucent. \\nIn anatomical changes the phloem may destroy (phloem necrosis) eg-potato leaf roll \\ndisease.

The abnormal meristamatic activity of phloem parenchyma resulting to \\nformation of tumors. \\nStem pitting or wood pitting symptoms are caused by development of localized areas \\nof disorganized parenchyma instead of xylem and phloem. \\n(b) Cytological and ultra structural changes: The main cell organelles influend by \\nviruses appear to be nucleus, chloroplast and mitochondria. In some cases disintegration \\nof cell organelles like ribosomes and endoplasmic reticulum may take place. \\nNuclei: Many viruses show no detectable change on the nucleus but some may give \\nrise to intranuclear inclusions of various sorts and may affect the nucleolus on the size \\nand shape of the nucleus. \\nNuclei texture become granular, chromatin may be reduced. Nucleoli become swollen \\nor hypertrophied and disintegrated eg-Geminivirus. Some times the nuclei may become \\nfilled with virus particles and greatly enlarged. The perinuclear space may be filled with \\nsome Rhabdo-viruses. Crystalline plate like inclusions were observed in cells infected with \\ntobacco etch virus. \\nChloroplast: There may be structural and biochemical degeneration of chloroplasts. \\nSmall peripheral vesicles may be seen in the chloroplast. Chloroplast may be swollen, \\nrounded and clumped together in the cell. Sometimes it become club shaped. There may \\nbe accumulation of starch grains and their size and number may be abnormal. The colour \\nmay be from normal green to colourless. Sometimes the chloroplast may be fragmented. \\nMitochondria: There may be regeneration or aggregation of mitochondria in virus \\ninfected cells. Sometimes mitochondria may be filled with vesicles also. \\nChanges in cell wall: Due to virus infection the cell become abnormally thickened. \\nThere may be deposition of electron dense material between cell wall and plasma \\nmembrane. Callus deposition may also be induced with some virus infections, which may \\nhelp in restricting virus movement. \\nRibosomes: There may be disturbances in the ribosomes. These may disappear or142 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nmay become integrated with inclusion bodies. There may be proliferation of the plasma\\xad\\nlemma to produce vesicles. \\nInclusions body: The major cytological effect of virus infection is development of \\ninclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies are the intra cells structures produced de novo as a \\nresult of virus infection. Inclusion bodies may contain virus particles, virus related \\nmaterials or ordinary cell constituents in a normal or degenerate conditions. These \\nintracellular inclusions is of diagnostic value. \\nMatz (1919), Kunkel (1921), and Smith (1924) were among the first workers to observe \\nthese inclusions and for some time a controversy centred about their nature. \\nThere are two main types of inclusions, crystalline and amorphorous (also known \\nas X-bodies). \\nInclusion bodies are most common in the epidermal cells of leaves and stems, but \\nthey also occur in the roots and flowers and in most tissues except the phloem sieve \\nelements. (Bawden 1964). \\nMcWhorter (1965) has tabulated the various types of intracellular inclusions as \\nfollows: \\nGroup A-Amorphous inclusions only, crystalline inclusions absent. Eg-Amorphous \\nspherules in wound tumour disease of Rumex acetosa. \\nGroup B-Amorphous and crystalline inclusions. Crystal in cytoplasm seldom or \\nnever present in the nucleus. TMV in tobacco, red clover vein mosaic in Vida faba. \\n~ \\nGroup C-Amorphous and crystalline inclusions; crystal present in both nuclei and \\ncytoplasm. Tobacco etch virus in solonaceae. \\nGroup D-Other entities unusual or only described in part in virus infected cells of \\nthe wild sunflowers. \\nX-bodies: The amorphous inclusion are called \\'X-bodies\\' and resemble certain \\nmicroorganism. They are amoeboid in shape and are virus induced structures in t:he cell \\nwhere components of viruses are synthesized and assembled. Matsui (1959) divided X\\xad\\nbodies into two categories based upon their fine structures. One appears elliptical in \\noutline and is almost entirely composed of dense granules varying in size, there is no \\nenvelope. The other usually appears spherical in outline and consists of a narrow \\nperipheral zone and large internal vacuole. \\nIntraplasmic crystalline Inclusions: Intracellular inclusions seem to be associated \\nonly with rod shaped virus particles. No inclusion bodies have been described in \\nconnection with \\'spherical\\' viruses although microcrystals of tomato bushy stunt virus \\nhave been observed in the cells of infected Datura stramonium. \\nIntranuclear inclusions: These inclusions are mainly in the form of thin plates, \\nbirefringent when seen from the edge. Their occurrence is sufficiently regular as to be of \\ndiagnostic value. \\nIntranuclear crystalline inclusions have been observed within leaves of Vicia Jaba \\nor Phaseolus vulgaris infected with bean yellow mosaic virus. The inclusions occurredPLANT VIRUSES 143 \\nfrequently in groups in the nucleoplasm whereas they usually occurred singly \\nwithin the nucleolus and were so large to distort it. The inclusions revealed a regular \\nperiodicity of striation within them. The cytoplasm also contained similar crystalline \\ninclusions. \\nBuffer \\nIn phloem, viral nucleic acid or \\nvirus is carried with the photo· \\nsynthate throughout the plant \\nViral nucleic acid \\nVirus taken in by Viral nucleic acid Viral nucleic acid replicates in \\nwounded cell freed from coat cell.

There are the spindle bodies found in virus affected cacti, and \\nthe bizarre \\'pin-wheels\\' and \\'cat-O-nine tails\\'. \\nPresence of inclusions composed of vesicles and virus in some immature tracheary \\nelements may indicate that virus multiplies in these cells. Complex membranous \\nstructures together with unbranched tubules containing single rows of virus-like \\nparticles have been observed in the case of strawberry latent rings pot virus and cow \\npea mosaic virus. \\nCLASSIFICATION & NOMENCLATURE \\nMost of the plant viruses are named after the most conspicuous symptom they cause \\non the first host in which they have been studied. Thus a virus causing mosaic on tobacco \\nis called Tobacco mosaic virus, whereas the disease itself is called tobacco mosaic; another \\nvirus causing spotted wilt symptom on tomato is called tomato spotted wilt virus, and \\nthe disease is called tomato spotted wilt. \\nAll viruses belong to kingdom viruses. Within the kingdom, viruses are distinguished \\nas RNA viruses and DNA viruses depending upon wheather the nucleic acid of virus144 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nis RNA or DNA. These viruses are further divided depending upon wheather they possess \\none or two strands of RNA or DNA of either positive or negative sense, either filamentous \\nor isometric. Within each of these groups there may be viruses replicating via a polymerase \\nenzyme (+ RNA or DNA virus) or via a reverse transcriptase (-RNA or DNA viruses). \\nMost virus consist of nucleic acid surrounded by coat protein, but some also have a \\nmembrane attached to them. Some viruses have all their genome in one particle (monopartite \\nviruses) but the genome of other (multipartite) viruses is divided among two, three or rarely \\nfour particles. Other classification characteristic include the symmetry of helix in helical \\nviruses or number and arrangement of protein subunits in the isometric viruses, size of \\nvirus and any other physical, chemical or biological properties. \\nThe current nomenclature and classification scheme of plant viruses is as follows:-\\ncD \\n~~0 \\n~A a ® \\nr=Purines ,&$~ 1.,,[PY} rimidines / k, ~ \"t \\n.1.1.

Most of the work is largely confined \\nto estimation of alterations in various components like carbohydrates, sugars, phenolics, \\nalkaloids growth regulators, nucleic acids. Important metabolic functions like photosyn\\xad\\nthesis, respiration and transpiration rates were also changed. Mostly the changes taking \\nplace in leaves have been studied, because they constitute most of the herbaceous host \\nplant.

There are mostly reports of increase in respiration rate in mosaic diseased plants. \\nBut in some cases where disease is well developed respiration rate may be lower. In plants \\ndeveloping local lesions the respiration rate is always higher. Increased respiration may \\ninvolve increase in the activity of some enzymes of glycolytic and pentose phosphate \\npathways. The results have been contradictory because various variable factors have not \\nbeen taken into account. \\nPhotosynthesis \\nVirus infection usually affects the process of photosynthesis. There is reduced carbon \\nfixation due to virus infection which may be due to a variety of biochemical and physical \\nchanges and becomes detectable a few days after infection. \\nChloroplast colour may change from normal green to colourless. There is a reduction \\nin the number of grana and chlorophyll content. Photosynthetic activity can be changed \\nor reduced due to change in chloroplast structure by reduced content of photosynthetic \\npigments or by reduction in specific proteins. \\nThe biochemistry of photosynthesis and related pathways can be affected as a result \\nof virus infection. There may be diversion of the products of photosynthesis carbon \\nfixation. Instead of sugar formation there may be production of organic acid and amino \\nacid. These changes, may be transitional and may return to normal pattern when active \\nvirus multiplication is over. \\nThe most general effect of virus infection is a reduction in photosynthetic activity \\nwhich is due to change in a variety of biochemical and phYSiological changes. \\nTranspiration \\nIn severly infected plants, transpiration rate is generally reduced as compared to \\nhealthy plants. The reported effects over the first 1-2 weeks after inoculation vary. \\nEnzymes \\nInfection may affect enzyme activities through changes in the amount of enzyme \\ninhibitors or activators released when cells are disrupted. Increase in catalase, peroxidase \\n(enzyme or isoenzymes) and polyphenol oxidases has been reported for various host-virus \\ncombinations. There is a marked increase in the activity of nucleases enzyme which may \\nbe because of there direct involvement with virus synthesis. Increase in activity was also \\nobserved in acid phosphatase, aconitase and starch synthetase in different host-virus \\ncombination. However pentose phosphate isomerease and succinyl co-A synthetase \\nactivity was decreased following infection with TMV in tobacco plants. Virus infection \\nC\\'in also affect the expression of host genes encoding enzymes. \\nHormones \\nVirus infection influences hormone activities in infected plants and plant hormones.150 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nQuantitative effects of infection on concentration have been shown for all the major groups \\nof plant hormones. Systemic virus infections tend to impair the steady state auxin levels \\nwith consequent morphological alterations. Stunting in virus infected plants has been \\nassociated with a decrease in gibbrellins. Change have been observed in reduced or \\nincreased cytokinins and absicic acids. \\nThe most affected plant growth regulator is ethylene which is associated with \\nsenescence in plants. Generally its production is increased in virus\\' infection. \\nCHANGES IN LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT METABOLITES \\nThere are reports of accumulation of free amino acids in virus infected plants. An \\nincrease in amides (glutamine and asparagines) may be due two reasons: either due to \\nthe breakdown of host proteins or due to inhibition of normal protein synthesis as a result \\nof which they are not properly utilized and accumulate in free from. However in many \\nhost virus combinations deficiency of both soluble and insoluble nitrogen compounds may \\noccur during periods when virus is rapidly being synthesized. \\nPhosphorus is a vital component of all viruses and disturbances in phosphorus \\ncontent is observed in virus infected plants. However there is no clear picture of the effect \\nof virus infection on host phosphorus metabolism. Increase in organic acid synthesis \\nduring virus replication is reported. Some essential elements like Mn, Cu, Zn are highly \\nreduced in virus infection whereas the infection has slight effect on K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Band \\nAI. Reduction in specific mineral elements are associated with certain virus disease \\nsymptoms. \\nVirus infection causes loss of chlorophylls giving the yellowish colouration due to \\ncarotene and xanthophylls but these pigments are also decreased in\\' some diseases. In \\nsome virus infections particularly characterized by dark green symptoms, there may be \\nmore chlorophyll than the uninoculated control plants. \\nChanges in nucleic acid: Virus infection has little effect on DNA content of host cell. \\nHowever this infection affect differently with RNA synthesis in different host virus \\ncombinations. Chloroplast and cytoplasmic rRNA synthesis may be affected as a result \\nof virus infection. This effect of infection may vary with age. The changes observed in \\nyoung and old leaves significantly vary. A reduction in chloroplast ribosomes without \\na marked effect on cytoplasmic ribosomes is a fairly common feature for mosaic diseases. \\nChanges in Proteins: There is a substantial reduction in host protein synthesis (by \\n75%), when the virus is actively replicating in virus infection. During this period the host \\nmachinery is involved in the synthesis of viral proteins rather than host proteins. The \\ncoat protein of a virus (like TMV) can represent half of the total protein in the diseased \\nleaf. A reduction in the amount of most abundant host protein ribulose biphosphate \\ncarboxyl oxygenase (RUBISCO) is one of the commonest effects of virus that cause mosaic \\nand yellowing diseases. \\nLipids: The lipid content of leaves infected with virus may be greater than healthy \\nleaves or in few host-virus combinations it may be less. \\nCarbohydrates: Virus infection significantly influences the carbohydrate synthesisPLANT VIRUSES 151 \\nas well as rate of translocation. There is a large accumulation of carbohydrate and sugars \\nin virus-infected leaves as compared to healthy leaves. \\nIn conclusion, Diener (1963) considers that the physiological derangements most \\ncommonly associated with plant virus infections are as follows: (i) decreased photosyn\\xad\\nthetic activity (ii) increased rate of respiration (iii) accumulation of soluble nitrogen \\ncompounds, particularly amides; (iv) increased activity of polyphenol oxidase and \\naccumulation of oxidized polyphenol derivatives. (v) decreased activity of growth regu\\xad\\nlating substances. \\nViral Diseases of Tomato \\nThe first record of virus diseases of tomato in India seems to be by Likhite in 1930. \\nThe leaf curl of tomato was\\' described in 1948. Sastry and Singh (1971, 1974a), Sastry \\net al. (1976) and Singh et al., (1973) have made detailed study of reiationship between \\nvector, vector control, and incidence of tomato leaf curl. Viral diseases causes severe losses \\non all fresh market and canning tomatoes. \\nLEAF CURL OF TOMATO \\nThe disease has been reported from India, Sri Lanka, Nyasaland (Malawi) and South \\nAfrica. Leaf curl disease incidence is reported to be 83% in the winter crop planted in \\nOctober and 14% in the summer crop planted in February (Tripathi and Varma, 2002). \\nWhen the plants are infected within 20 days of transplanting the loss may be up to 92% \\nwhile infections of 35 and 50 days old crops result in 74 and 29% loss, respectively. \\nSymptoms \\nLeaf curl is characterized by severe stunting of the plants due to shortening of \\ninternodes and downward rolling and crinkling of the leaves. The newly formed leaves \\nshow chlorosis. The older curled leaves become leathery and brittle. After the plant \\nbecomes infected there is considerable drop of flowers, fruit fails to set, and no more \\nmarketable fruit is produced. The whole plant looks pale and produces more lateral \\nbranches resulting in a bushy appearance. There is partial or complete sterility of the plant. \\nThe Causal Organism \\nLeaf curl of tomato is caused by the Tobacco leaf curl virus (geminivirus group or \\nfamily Geminiviridae, genus Begomovirus). Its synonyms are Tobacco cabbaging virus, \\ntobacco curly leaf virus and tobacco frenching virus. The genome of geminiviruses is \\ncomposed of circular, single stranded DNA, encapsulated by multiple subunits of a single \\ncapsid protein. Most are bipartite having two almost equal sized genomic components \\ndesignated A and B, separately encapsulated in geminate particles (Poiston et al. 1997). \\nThe Indian isolates from New Delhi and Karnataka have been separately named such \\nas Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNdV), a bipartite strain, and Tomato leaf curl \\nBangalore virus (ToLCBV), a monopartile strain. Chakraborty et al (2003) have described \\ntomato leaf curl Gujarat virus (ToLCGV) from Varanasi in India which causes a severe \\nleaf curl disease of tomato.152 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nDisease Cycle \\nThe geminate particles of the leaf curl virus (ToLCV) measure 25-30 x 15-20 nm. The \\nToLCV is neither seed nor sap transmissible but external contamination of seed m2ty occur. \\nDodder transmission has been reported in India. The main agency of its transmission \\nin nature is the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci. TYLCV is a whitefly transmitted geminivirus \\ngenome consists of a single circular SSDNA the genome of the other known whitefly \\ntransmitted goes viruses consists of two ssDNA. The vector can transmit the virus after \\na 20-minute acquisition access period and 60 min of inoculation access period with \\nminimum latency period of 4-9 hours. In India, the virus is reported to be transmitted \\nby the vector after 30 minutes of acquisition access and 30 min of inoculation access \\nperiods with a latency period of 6 hours. Even a single viruliferous whitefly is able to \\ntransmit the virus. The virus is retained by the vector for more than 12 days or for the \\nwhole life but there is no evidence that it multiplies in the vector or is transferred to the \\nprogeny of the vector. The time required for symptom expression varies in different \\ncultivars of tomato. Whitefly populations per plant also vary with host cultivar. The \\nnumber of whiteflies per plant has no relationship with the time of appearance or severity \\nof symptoms. At low temperatures symptoms are delayed. \\nControl and Treatment \\nResistance to the virus in commonly cultivated tomato varieties is lacking. Wild \\ntomato (Lycopersicon pemvianum) has high degree of resistance to the leaf curl virus. L. \\nglalldulosll1n also does not show symptoms of leaf curl. Some accessions of the wild species \\nLycopersicon hirslltll11l have been identified as the best source of resistance to tomato leaf \\ncurl virus as well as tomato yellow leaf curl virus. In Punjab, the genotypes TLB 111, \\n119, 122, 128, 129, 130 and 134 have been found resistant to ToLCV. \\nProtection of seedlings from infection brought by the vectors is important. It can be \\nachieved by using insecticides or insect repellents. Tripathi and Verma (2002) have \\ndemonstrated that seedlings protected by perforated polythene bags and transplanted in \\npolysheet mulched fields have low incidence of the disease. Some workers have claimed \\ngood control of the disease through reducing vector population. Use of systemic insec\\xad\\nticides such as methyl parathion (0.02%) and dimethoate (0.5%) as spray of carbofuran \\n(1.5 kg a.i.jha) as soil application has been found effective in controlling build up of \\nwhitefly population and thus reducing the incidence of leaf curl. Spraying should be \\nstarted soon after transplanting. Carbofuran (Furadon 3G) at the rate of 3.3gj Sq.lll. not \\nonly reduces disease incidence but also increases fruit yield. Nursery treatment, seedling \\nsoak, and plot treatments reduce populations of Bemisia tabaci and diseases incidence. \\nSastry et al (1976) suggested increased plant population from 30 to 90 per sq.m., three \\napplications of insecticides (parathion 0.02%, demetonmethyl 0.02% or dimethoate 0.05%) \\nas spray at 15-days interval with one soil application of phorate or carbofuran for control \\nof the disease. Foliar application of the antibiotics Validomycin-A (0.02%), Avomycin-A \\n(0.01 %) and of guanidine azoguanine, etc. suppress the disease. Mukherjee and \\nRaychaudhuri (1966) had reported that the root dip of tomato seedlings in gibberellic acid \\nand 2-thiouracil at 50 pp, reduces leaf curl incidence. Spraying of 2,4-D is highly effectivePLANT VIRUSES 153 \\nin not only suppressing tomato leaf curl incidence but also in many-fold increase of fruit \\nyield. \\nIn some countries like Israel, because of TYLCV, tomatoes are now produced only \\nunder fine mesh and frequent application of insecticides. Considerable efforts are presently \\nbeing made to genetically engineer tomato plants to express certain genomic areas of \\nTyLCV that seem to protect the plant from subsequent infection by the virus. \\nMOSAIC OF TOMATO \\nTomato mosaic can be caused by many different viruses such as TMV, Cucumber \\nmosaic virus (CMV), Potato virus X, and Potato virus Y. The common tomato mosaic was \\nearlier thought to be the same as TMV but now it is considered to be a distinct virus \\n(ToMV) of the same tobamovirus group. \\nSymptoms \\nThe symptoms of tomato mosaic are generally influenced by temperature, day length, \\nlight intensity, plant age, virus strain, and tomato variety. In the tropics or in warm weather \\nwith long day length and high light intensity leaves show light and dark green mosaic \\nmottle, sometimes with distortion of young leaves. Green areas are sunken giving the leaf \\na rough appearance. In winter, with low light intensity, short day length, and temperature \\nnot above 20°C, plants often are severely stunted and leaves distorted to \"fern-Ieaf\" or \\ntendril-shape but mottling may be slight. Seedling infection may kill the plants. Fruits \\nare fewer, undersized, and often deformed. In some cases there is necrosis of stem, petioles, \\nleaves and fruits. \\nIn aucuba mosaic the symptoms appear as downward curling of the whole leaf \\nwith slight turning down at the margins. Surface of the leaf is rough, wrinkled or \\ncorrugated. Chlorosis appears as small points of yellow areas and gradually spreads. \\nIn extreme cases almost the entire lamina of old and new leaves becomes pale yellow \\nto white, with scattered small islands of green which stand up as blisters. In less extreme \\ncases the green areas are larger but not as large as the chlorotic areas. The plant is \\nnot killed but growth is retarded. The virus induces pollen sterility which results in \\nlow fruiting and low yield. \\nThe Causal Organism \\nThe virus causing the common mosaic of tomato is known as TOlllato mosaic virus \\n(ToMV, tobamovirus group). There are many strains of the virus producing different \\nsymptoms and often these have been described as different diseases. These strains are \\ntomato aucuba mosaic, tomato enation mosaic, yellow rings spot strain and tomato rosetted \\nstrain. \\nParticles of the virus are straight tubules with helical construction and measure 300 \\nx 18 nm. The single stranded RNA constitutes about 5% of the particle weight. The \\nparticles occur in all the tissues including the pollen and seed but not in the embryo. \\nThe inclusion bodies appear as crystalline structures, amorphous masses, fine needles, \\nfibrous spikes, spindle bodies, and amoeboid X-bodies.154 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nDisease Cycle \\nIn tomato sap the thermal inactivation point is 85-900C, dilution end point is 1:100000 \\nto 1:1000000. In air-dried tomato leaves the virus has been found to remain infective even \\nafter 24 years at laboratory temperatures. The sap retains infectivity for 77 days or more \\nat laboratory temperatures and for several years at 0° to 2°C. The virus, like the TMV, \\nis easily sap transmissible and is mainly transmitted by man through contact during \\ncultivation. No natural vector are known. Seed transmission also occurs mainly as external \\nseed contamination. TMV and ToMV become established in the seeds of tomato and bell \\npepper, irrespective of plant growth stage, at the time of inoculation. However, concen\\xad\\ntration of the virus is high in seeds from plants inoculated early. Dodder can transmit \\nthe virus. Diseased crop debris is also a source of primary inoculum. \\nControl \\nUse of virus-free seedlings is the most important step for control of tomato mosaic. \\nTo produce healthy seedlings the seedbeds should be those in which no solanaceous crop \\nsusceptible to TMV had been grown for the last 4-6 months. Soil sterilization by heat is \\nalso recommended. Seeds should be treated in hot water at 50°C for 25 min or with 20% \\ntrisodium phosphate solution. There should be an interval of at least 5 months between \\nsusceptible crops in the same filed. Field workers should avoid use of tobacco products \\nwhile working in the field. If they remove a diseased plant they should wash their hands \\nin soap solution. \\nRICE TUNGRO VIRUSES \\nTungro is the most important virus disease of rice in south and south-east Asia and \\nalso in the southern part of China. The virus is reported from Philippines, Malaysia, \\nIndonesia, Thailand, India and Pakistan. In India the disease is present in the south east \\nto the north west parts of the country. The annual loss due to tungro is estimated at US \\n$ 1.5 billion globally. \\nSymptoms \\nIn rice the symptoms depend on host cultivar. In the cultivar TN 1, seedlings show \\nstunting with mottling and yellowing of leaves. In growing plants there is reduced \\ntillering. Yellowing and orange yellow coloration of leaves is a common symptom. Small \\nand sterile panicles develop in mature plants. In early infection the young plants may \\ndie prematurely. \\nThe Causal Organism \\nTungro is a composite disease caused by two viruses: the rice tungro spherical virus \\n(RTSV) and the rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV). The RSTV is a ssRNA virus which \\ncauses only very mild stunting of the host plants without leaf symptoms but it intensifies \\nthe symptoms of tungro caused by RTBV. The RTBV is a dsDNA bacilliform virus which \\ncauses mild stunting and yellowing of leaves. RTBV causes the main symptoms of tungro. \\nIt is dependent on RSTV for transmission by the insect vectors. In Philippines and SouthPLANT VIRUSES 155 \\nand South East Asia the RTSV occurs and spreads as an independent virus but generally \\nas a latent disease. \\nRTSV is associated with maize chlorotic dwarf virus group. The particles of RTSV \\nare isometric with a diameter of 30-33 nm. The ssRNA is in single piece (mono partite) \\nand constitutes 12% of the particle weight. The RTSV RNA consists of about 11 kb, and \\nits protein coat is made of two types of protein molecules. The RTBV belongs to Budnavirus \\ngroup. The particles are bacilliform, 100-400 nm long and 30-35 nm in diameter. Both \\nviruses are transmitted by same leafhopper vectors. The thermal inactivation point of RTSV \\nis 60°C. The longevity in vitro at room temperature is 24 hours, one week at 4°C and one \\nmonth in frozen samples. In the host cells dense granules are seen in the cytoplasm. \\nChloroplasts and other cell organelles in the infected tissues are degenerated. \\nDisease Cycle \\nOnJza species are the main host but at least 63 species of grasses could be infected. \\nNatural occurrence on grasses in and around rice fields is reported. However, all except \\nOnJza species are poor hosts of the vectors. \\nThe rice tungro viruses are not transmitted by sap inoculation or ,by seed or dodder. \\nIn nature the main agency of tungro transmission is the green leafhopper, Nephotettix \\ncincticeps (N. virescens). Other vectors are N. nigropictus, N. malayanus, N. parvus, N. apicalis \\nand Recilia (Anazuma) dorsalis. N. cincticeps is the most effective vector and disperses the \\nvirus in the rice fields. All the five larval stages and adults of the leafhopper vector transmit \\nthe viruses in non-persistent manner. There is strong biological relationship of the vector \\nwith rice plants on which it has high adult longevity, nymph survival and population \\ngrowth. Minimum acquisition feed period is 5-7 min but transmission increases with \\nacquisition access feeding upto 4 days. There is no latency. The vector becomes viruliferous \\nimmediately after feeding. Nymphs cease to transmit the virus when they molt. All stages \\nlose ability to transmit the virus within 5 days after the end of the acquisition feed. Weed \\nhosts that may playa role in survival and dissemination of the rice tungro viruses include \\nLeersia hexandra, Eleusine indica, Echinochloa crusgalli, Echinochloa glabrescens, E. colona and \\nLeptochloa chinensis. \\nN. cinticeps is monophagous to rice. Its density can reach high levels depending on \\nthe environment. After rice is harvested, the density of this vector falls rapidly to a low \\nlevel or to nil in the rice fields. Seasonal pattern of immigration and population dynamics \\nof the major vectors (N. cincticeps, N. nigropictus and Recilia dorsalis) determines the \\nincidence of tungro. Under Assam conditions, Nath and Bhagabati (2002) observed that \\nleafhopper populations are first seen during June-July in the seedbeds. The population \\nreaches the peak in the main field in October-November and then disappears from \\nDecember to May. N. virescens populations were lower than N. nigropictus but higher than \\nR. dorsalis. Tungro infected plants including rice stubbles or volunteer rice serve as source \\nof RTBV and RTSV. The vector that feeds on source plants, moves to newly transplanted \\nfields in surrounding areas and disperses the viruses. Probably the flight range of N. \\ncincticeps is several kilometers. Initially few plants are infected and form the source for \\nfurther spread. Generally, the plants with secondary infection from such sources form156 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\npatches a few to several meters in diameter. Such patches later fuse with each other. In \\ntungro-endemic areas major infection of rice plants with the viruses occurs after trans\\xad\\nplanting. Infection rate in the seedbeds is low. In transplanted fields, infection with RTSV \\nalone precedes infection with RTBV. The disease incidence is generally low in fields \\nplanted in the early crop season when the vector population is low, but it is high in fields \\nplanted later when the vector population has built up. \\nControl \\nUse of rice cultivars resistant to tungro has been a major approach for control of. \\nthe disease. The resistance to the viruses is correlated with resistance to the vectors. The \\nresistant cultivars become susceptible in few years because populations of the vector \\ndevelops that can feed on these cultivars. A transgenic japonica rice plant is reported that \\ncontains RTSV replicase gene. Plants expressing full length Rep gene in the (+) sense \\norientation show 100% resistance to RTSV even if challenged with a high level of \\ninoculum. The rice cultivar Basmati 370 is reported to be resistant. In many countries long \\nfallow periods reduce the disease incidence. \\nPlant extracts have been used to reduce the population of the vector and disease \\nseverity. Metabolites of the rice false smut fungus, Claviceps onjZae sativae, are reported \\nto provide tolerance in rice to the tungro disease. Neem seed cake applied at 5 kg/0.032 \\nha of nursery followed by foliar spray of 5% neem kernel extract in the main field reduces \\nvector population and incidence of tungro. Two fungi, Beauveria bassiana and Paecilomyces \\namoeneroseus, are reported as parasites of rice green leaf hopper, Nephotettix virescens. Spray \\nof conidial suspension of the fungi on rice plants kills the vectors. \\nSUGARCANE MOSAIC \\nMosaic is most widely distributed and best known of the virus diseases of sugarcane. \\nIt was initially reported from Java in 1892 but now it is known to be of worldwide \\noccurrence being common in India, North and South Americas, and many Pacific and \\nAtlantic islands. The occurrence of sugarcane mosaic in India was first discovered in 1921 \\nat Pusa (Bihar). Although a source of potential danger to sugar industry in countries like \\nthe USA, the disease has not been regarded as menace to sugarcane in this country. Even \\na 100% mosaic affected crop shows a reduction of about 10-12% in yield and the juice \\nquality remains unaffected. Perhaps, it is due to prevalence of some mild strain(s) of the \\nvirus occurring in most of the sugarcane varieties in India. There are indications that more \\nvirulent strains are also present in the country on certain varieties like Co. 313 in Punjab \\nand Co. 527. The disease may cause as much as 21 % loss in yield. \\nSymptoms \\nThe first symptom of sugarcane mosaic appear about 6 weeks after planting and \\ncontinue to develop throughout the monsoon season after which they are obliterated on \\nmaturity of the plants. The primary and critical symptom of the disease is the appearance \\nof pale patches or blotches in the green surface of the leaf. Small areas of the leaf are \\nof a paler green colour than the rest. These patches are not uniform in size and shape.PLANT VIRUSES 157 \\nThey may be large in some varieties and small in others. Usually they are oval or elongated, \\nthe longer axis lying parallel to the midrib. In other parts of the world, the patches on \\nsugarcane leaf are not confined between veins but in India there is a clear demarcation \\nof these patches by the leaf veins. The youngest unfolded leaves show the mottling very \\nclearly while the symptoms are not very clear on older leaves. Sometimes leaves of young \\ntillers are stiff, erect and crinkled. Mottling of the stem also occurs in some varieties and \\nmay lead to death of cells resulting in formation of cankers. \\nThe cells of affected leaves always show, in one part of the cytoplasm, an area of \\nproteolysis. This can be seen under microscope as a more heavily stained area than the \\nrest and consisting of a vacuolated mass representing the X-body. Stems may show \\nmottling or marbling , the areas later becoming necrotic. The stems becomes small and \\ndeformed. \\nThe Causal Organism \\nSugarcane mosaic virus (750 x llnm) is transmitted primarily vegetatively in \\nsugarcane during propogation of the crop. The disease is caused by sugarcane mosaic \\nvirus (SCMV) which belongs to potyviruses group. Its synonym is grass mosaic virus. \\nThe particles of the virus are flexuous filaments measuring 620-750 x 13-15 nm. Maximum \\nconcentration of virus particles is found in young leaves and minimum in roots of old \\ninfected plants. Particle composition is not fully known. In addition to sugarcane, the virus \\ncan infect other graminaceous plants such as maize, sorghum, millets, wheat, barley, \\nrye, and some grasses. Natural occurrence of the virus on maize, sorghum, pearl millet \\nand elephant grass has been reported from India. Brachiaria is also a natural host of \\nsome strains of SMV. One strain that attacks Mllsa textilis has some hosts outside the \\ngramineae. \\nThe following serologically related potyviruses were considered strain of the Sug\\xad\\narcane mosaic vims. Sugarcane mosaic strains A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K (these strains \\nrarely infect sorghum), Maize dwarf mosaic strain A and B, Sorghum red stripe strain, \\nEuropean maize mosaic strain and Abaca mosaic strain on Musa textilis. \\nDisease Cycle \\nThe virus is transmitted from sugarcane to sugarcane by at least 7 species of aphids \\nsuch as Dacttj1lOtus ambrosiae, Hysterolleura setariae, Rhopalosiphll1n maidis, Toxoptera graminum, \\nR. maidis and Shizaphis graminum are reported as vectors of sugarcane mosaic virus in \\nIndia. Transmission is in the non-persistent manner. Seed transmission is reported only \\nfor maize dwarf mosaic strain. Vegetative propagation is the main source of primary \\ninfection in sugarcane. \\nThe thermal inactivation point of SCMV is 53-55°C and dilution end point 1:1000. \\nIn vitro longevity is 2-24 hours. \\nFor experimental purposes the virus can easily be transmitted by introducing it into \\nthe actively growing tissues. Young leaves are most suitable for testing. Most common \\nmethod is to use a needle to puncture the tissue over which infected juice has been spread \\nor infected leaf has been wrapped. SCMV moves from the point of inoculation to young158 TEXT BOOK .OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nleaves, roots and tillers and eventually to leaves that had emerged prior to inoculation. \\nThe pattern of SCMV distribution in moderately resistant and susceptible cultivars is not \\nmuch different. However, the virus moves more slowly in the moderately resistant than \\nin the susceptible cultivar. \\nControl \\nDue to continuous evolution of strains of the virus, its presence on grass or cultivated \\ncollateral hosts and long growing season of the sugarcane crop, resistant varieties are \\nnot permanent solution of the mosaic problem. Following practices have been recom\\xad\\nmended to minimize its incidence. \\n1. Use of selected healthy setts for seed. \\n2. Heat therapy (hot water or hot air) is effective against certain strains and can \\nbe used for raising disease-free nurseries. \\n3. Systematic rouging of the infected canes if the incidence is not very high. \\n4. Elimination of grass hosts. \\n5. Use of resistant or tolerant varieties. \\nALGAL VIRUSES-THE CYANOPHAGES \\nCyanophages are the viruses that attack on cyanobacteria i.e. the members of blue \\ngreen algae. The first actual demonstration of an algal virus was made by Safferman & \\nMorris (1963) from the waste stabilization pond of Indiana University (USA). They isolated \\nthe virus from the filamentous blue-green alge Plectonema bonJanum. Safferman and morris \\ntested 78 algal species For susceptibility to the virus and of these the virus lysed 11 \\nfilamentous strains. Among the genera infected were LyngbtJa, Plectonema and Phormidium. \\nThe first algal virus was named as strain LPP-I, the initials representing these three hosts. \\nThere after several serological strains of LPP were isolated and named LPP-I LPP-2, \\nLPP-3, LPP-4 and LPP-5. These viruses are called as blue green algal viruses or \\ncyanophages. They screened 78 host organisms and found the cyanophages only in 11 \\nfilamentous cyanobacteria. \\nAfter the initial discovery several workers including Singh et al from Banaras Hindu \\nUniversity, India and Padan et al (1967) from Israel, Daft et al (1970) from Scotland \\nreviewed different type of cyanophages. \\nProperties of Cyanophages \\n(1) The morphology of LPP-I is studied in more detail as compared to other \\ncyanophages. They differ, morphologically as well as in their physio chemical properties. \\n(2) They are an icosahedron with a hexagonal head capsid and the tail is short with \\na length of approximately one quarter the diameter of the capsid (similar to T3 and T7 \\nbacteriophages) where as N-I group resembles with T2 and T4 phages (like T even, the \\ntail may be contractile or non-contractile). According to Smith et al. (1966b) the tail \\nassembly is longer in virus particles attached to the photosynthetic membranes.PLANT VIRUSES 159 \\n(3) According to Goldstein & Bendet (1967) U 3P-I has double stranded DNA and \\ncan be concentrated by acetone without significant loss in activity. \\n(4) The AS-I group has the largest cyanophages. The group G m and D-I are \\nserologically related but not show any relationship with T -phages. \\nLife Cycle \\nSimilar like bacteriophages the cyanophages follow the same one-step growth curve. \\nThe growth cycle resembles with that of T 4 phages. \\nThe first sign of infection in the alga can be readily recognized under optical \\nmicroscope by displacement of photosynthetic membranes. The actual infection of the alga \\ncan be observed on the electron microscope. Large number of virus particles can be seen \\nwith their tails inserted in the alga. \\nThe growth cycle of LPP-I has been studied in greater detail. LPP- I is adsorbed on \\nhost surface and the DNA is injected into the host cell leaving the protein coat outside \\nthe cell wall. The mechanism of DNA injection is not known. However soon after injection \\nof the genome the rate of protein synthesis is reduced and gradually blocked at the end \\nof 5 hour of injection. The phage multiplies in the invaginated photosynthetic lamellae \\nor in virogenic stroma. After injection following three types of proteins are formed earliest \\nproteins, earlier protein and the late or structural proteins. After three hours of infection, \\ndegradation of the host DNA begins and by the end of ~ hr it is converted into acid \\nsoluble matfrial. Sufficient amount of degraded DNA material is used up in building of \\nviral DNA. It is seen that in virogenic stroma synthesis of viral DNA takes place. The \\nlatent period differs in different viruses for example 7 hrs in LPP-I and N -I. At the end \\nafter maturation and assembly the progeny cyanophages are released almost from each \\ncell leaving aside the lysed cell. \\nAll nucleic acids of cyanophages analysed so far are linear double stranded DNAs. \\nThe cyanophages can playa significant role in control of blooms. But the problem is that, \\nthey are specific to genus and difficult to isolate. \\nOther Algal Viruses \\nAdolph and Haselkorn (1971), described a virus that attacks Nostoc, it has a long \\ncontractile tail which differentiates it from LPP-I and known as N-1. A virus similar \\nto N-I with a polyhedral head and a long tail, attacks only unicellular blue-green \\nalgae. \\nA presumed virus attacking Oscillatoria closely resembles TMV; it is a slender rod \\nabout 190A ° in diameter and 3000A ° in length. It aggregate to form crystalline granules. \\nLee (1971) described a virus from a algae (Sirodotia) it occurs in crystalline arrays of \\npolygonal particles each about 500-600A ° in diameter. \\nA virus has been isolated from a green alga, Oedogonium which occur in the germling \\nstages of the alga and is hexagonal in transverse section with a maximum dimension \\nof about 2400A o.160 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nA virus, resembling the Tipula irridescent virus has been found in a marine species. \\nThe brown alga, Chorda tomentosa, which is about 1,700 A ° in diameter and possess a \\ncore of electron dense material enclosed by three-layered electron dense shell.

They are wide spread \\nin all taxonomic groups of fungi. Indeed over 70 species representing all the main \\ntaxonomic groups of fungi have been involved (Hollings, 1975). \\nFor the first time Hollings (1962) gave the conclusive evidence of viruses that infected \\nthe cultivated mushrooms. Agaricus bisporus causing die back disease. The common \\nsymptom of mushroom virus disease are the loss of crop and the degeneration of mycelium \\nin the compost. At least 5000 fungal sps are known to contain mycoviruses. Most of the \\nspecies of Penicillium and /,spergillus have been found to be infected with viruses. \\nEcologically the mycophages appears to be intracellular, a life style for which they \\nare well fitted. \\nCharacteristics of Mycophages \\nAt present only few mycoviruses have been characterized and they are only the virus162 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nlike particles (VLPs) from the partially purified extracts from the fungus in electron \\nmicrograph of then section slides. \\nFive viruses have been isolated from mushrooms in Britain and they are known as \\nmushroom viruses 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Virus 3 is bacilliform (19 x 50 nm) while the other \\nfour are isometric virus (virus I = 25 nm, virus 2 = 29 nm, virus 4 = 35 nm while the \\nvirus 5 appears to be spherical in shape measuring 50 nm. (Hollings and Spire 1972). \\nThe mycoviruses have a heterogenous properties with a diameter (25-50 nm) and \\nparticle weight from 6-13 x 106 dalton. They possess 1-8 segments of dsRNA with a \\nmolecular weight of 2-8.5 x 106 dalton. All the known samples had only a single capsid \\nprotein but of varying molecular weight from 25-130 x 103 dalton in different viruses. \\nTransmission of mushroom viruses is by infected spores and by anastomosis of \\ninfected mycelium with healthy mycelium. Infected spores have a thinner wall than do \\nhealthy spores and germinate more quickly. Transmission by spores is so efficient that \\nno other vector is necessary. \\nDark (1979, 80) reviewed the replication of mycoviruses inside the host (the fungal \\ncell). He reported the host cell enzymes capable of transcribing the ssRNA and dsRNA \\nin vitro and probably dsRNA in vivo. Highly specific virus coded RNA polymerase are \\nnecessary for effective in vivo transcription and replication of dsRNA. Such polymerase \\nhas been demonstrated in a number of dsRNA mycoviruses. According to Buck, probably \\nthe polymerase remain confined within the virus particle during the replicative cycle of \\nmycoviruses. \\nExamples of Mycophages \\n(i) Mushroom (Agaricus bisporns) viruses \\nHollings & Spire (1972) recorded at least six viruses and VLP from cultivated \\nmushrooms, A. bisporns. The mycoviruses occur in a mixture of cells and are extremely \\nhard to separate. The number of spores in a suspension necessary to infect a tray is about \\nten. These viruses can cause water lodged stipes, or dry brown and leathery mushrooms, \\nor grey stunted clumps of dwarfed mushrooms that decay without further development \\nor thick short stalked mushrooms with poorly developed caps or long thin stalked \\nmushrooms. \\nIn recent years, there has been many reports of normal yield and mycelial growth \\nfrom virus infected mushroom crops suggesting that mycoviruses are not pathogenic \\n(Hollings, 1982). One of the possible reason may be due to, the suppression of virus \\nreplication and due to production of a mycotoxin (patulin) in several species of Penicillium \\nand Aspergillus. \\nA number of virus have been isolated from different sps of .Penicillium viz. P. \\nstolonifernm and P. junicliloslim are infected with viruses containing double stranded RNA. \\n(ii) Virus on other fungal sps. \\nFerault et al. (1971) isolated two types of virus particles from the spores of Piricularia \\nonJzae.PLANT VIRUSES 163 \\nSeveral different virus like particles have been isolated from Sclerotium cepivonlm \\nwhich is pathogenic to onions. Morphologically they are isometric, icosahedron. \\nVirus isolated from Ophiobolus graminis is a small isometric particles measuring about \\n29 nm in diameter. There are records of viruses and virus like particles from various species \\nof Puccillia. Lecoq et al. (1974) describe a virus particle 34 nm in diameter with a \\nsedimentation constant of 174S from Puccillia striiformis, P. mllivacearune and P. suavaeolens. \\nVirus like particles have been found in axenic cultures of Puccinia graminis. They are \\nisometric. \\nDue to the presence of mycoviruses in pathogenic fungi, the virulence of pathogens \\ngradually declines resulting in even death of fungi. Fungal isolates of take all of cereals \\n(caused by Gaellmannomyces graminis) containing only one kind of VLP\\'s are mostly more \\npathogenic than virus free isolate. Along with this a highly pathogenic isolate of G. \\ngramenis from wheat roots gradually lost the virulence over a period of 17 months in \\nculture. \\nSince viruses have been isolated from a number of plant pathogenic fungi, the \\npossibility of using viruses for the biological control of these fungi is a question of \\nimportance. \\nTaxonomic Position \\nTaxonomically, no serological relationship have been detected between any mycovirus \\nand morphologically similar viruses in higher plants. Similarly no mycoviruses is been \\ndemonstrated to infect higher plants. The members of international committee for virus \\ntaxonomy set a large taxonomic group to accommodate all dsRNA mycoviruses. Two such \\ngroups has now been designated. \\n(i) The Penicillium chnjsogenum virus group. \\n(ii) The Penicillium stoloniferum virus -S (PsV-S) group. \\nThe member viI:uses within each of these groups are serologically related. \\nTABLE 3 \\nTaxonomic Mfinity of Mycoviruses with other Viruses of Plants or Animals \\nMycovirus particles \\nRod-shaped particles \\nFilament particles \\nIsometric particles \\nBacilliform particles \\nMfinity with other viruses \\n(i) Tobamovirus type \\n(ii) Uncertain affinity \\nPotexvirus type \\nHerpes virus type \\nAlfalfa mosaic type \\nExample \\nPeziza ostracoderma \\nLentinus edodes \\nMycogone perinisa \\nArmillaria mellea \\nBoletus edulis \\nThrallstochytrium sp \\nPhytophthora infestans \\nAgaricus bisporus164 TEXT BOOK ,OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMost of the plant viruses contain RNA as genetic material.

Plant virusa!l or reoviridae contain dsRNA as genetic material e.g. \\nwound tumour virus, cauliflower mosaic virus contain dsDNA as their genetic material. \\nTMV (TOBACCO MOSAIC VIRUS) \\nTobacco mosaic is a serious disease of tobacco and tomato and causes serious losses \\nto tobacco and tomato and some other crop plants. It is world wide in distribution which \\naffects more than 150 genera mostly herbaceous (dicots), many vegetables, ornamental \\nflowers and weeds. It is the most resistant virus known so far of which the thermal death \\npoint is 90°C for 10 minutes. TMV was the first virus that was crystallized by Stanley \\nin 1935 from USA. \\nPathogen causes the damage on leaves, flowers, fruits and causes stunting in plants. \\nThe general symptom are chlorosis, curling, mottling, dwarfing, distortion and blistering \\nof leaves. TMV damages the solonaceous plant. After infection the common symptom is \\nappearance of irregular dark green and light green areas on the leaves (patchy pattern \\nof discoloured areas). The dark green areas are thicker and appears elevated, blister like \\nover the thinner, chlorotic light green areas. Slight downward curling and distortion of \\nleaves can also be seen. The leaves become narrow and elongated rather than oval shaped. \\nMottling of older leaves with or without malformations of the leaflets is produced \\nwhen the disease affects tomato. Leaflets become long and pointed and sometimes \\nshoestring like. The virus reduces the yield as well as quality of products i.e. nicotine \\ncontent is decreased by 20-30%. \\nFranklin et al. (1957) described the structure of TMV. It is rod shaped helical virus, \\n280 x 150 Ilm with a molecular weight of 39 x 106 dalton. The virion consist of protein \\ncoat, made up of 2,130 protein subunit of identical size. The protein subunits are arranged \\naround a central hole of 4 nm (40AO). Each protein subunit is made up of single \\npolypeptide chain made by 158 amino acids, the molecule weight of each polypeptide \\nchain is 17,500 dalton. The central/hole consist of ssRNA molecule which is also spirally \\ncoiled to form helix. This RNA consist of 6,500 nucleotides. In one turn of RNA contain \\n49 nucleotides. \\nTotal number of protein subunits counting in 3 turns is 49 i.e. 49/3 unit/turn. \\nTherefore single protein subunit is linked with 3 nucleotides TMV is an excellent \\nimmunogen. There are 3-5 different epitopes distributed over the surfa.ce of TMV protein. \\nThe two epitopes located on C-terminal and N-terminal extremities of polypeptide chain \\nare responsible for stimulating the production of antibodies. \\nTakeba (1975) demonstrated direct entry of TMV into the isolated protoplast from \\nmesophyll cells of tobacco. After entry the genetic material (RNA) rapidly starts uncoating \\nby removing the subunits from the capsid by using the host cell enzyme. The parented \\nRNA is localized in nucleus which do two functions, it acts as mRNA and direct the \\nsynthesis of protein and also function as template for the synthesis of complementary \\nstrand. \\nThe virus RNA utilizes the amino acids, ribosomes and tRNA of the host and \\nsynthesize the complementary strand and proteins, i.e. coat proteins of 17,500 dalton andPLANT VIRUSES 165 \\ntwo other polypeptide (of molecule weight 160,000 and 140,000 dalton). Nucleic acid is \\nabout 5-40% of virus and proteins 60-70%. \\nTMV is transmitted through cell sap of host and enters a new host through wound \\nincision. It is also transmitted by wind and water. \\nCryptogram of TMV = R/1 : 2/5 : E/E : 5/0. \\nCAMV (CAULIFLOWER MOSAIC VIRUS) \\nCaMV causes cauliflower mosaic on cauliflower. This is the plant virus where \\ndsDNA, open circular is the genetic material with single strand discontinuity like hepadna \\nvirus. In situ the DNA is linear but becomes circularized when extracted. \\nSingle virion has icosahedral symmetry of the capsid with 50 nm diameter. In infected \\ncauliflower leaves the cytoplasm has characteristic X bodies which are rounded structure. \\nFinger like projection arises from the cell walls of infected leaves. The mitochondria \\nand nuclei of infected cells become abnormal and the transmission of pathogen is by \\naphids. \\nCryptogram of Camv 0/2 : 5/15: 5/5: 5/ AP. \\nPOTATO VIRUS X (PVX) \\nPYX virus is distributed worldwide containing ssRNA as genetic material. There \\nare several strains of PYX developing different symptoms on different \\'Varieties of potato. \\nA large number of solonaceous plants like tobacco, datura, Solanum nigrum, egg plants, \\npepper, tomato etc can be infected by PYX. The infected tubers of potato transmit \\nthe virus particles which can remain alive about 5 months but can be inactivated at \\n74°C \\nPYX virus is also called as Solanu1Il virus, potato latent virus, mottle virus. The \\ninfected potato shows a wild mosaic between the veins on foliage. The infected plants \\nbecome dwarf and deformity in foliage occurs. The virus also causes top necrosis in \\ntubers. \\nStructurally PYX is a flexous rod in helical symmetry dimension ranging from 515 \\nx 11.2 nm capsid is made up of identical proteins subunit forming a helix of 3.3 nm, \\npitch and a hole of 3 nm diameter. Possibly a single subunit is associated with 3 or 4 \\nnucleotides. In India the PYX was first isolated in 1945 by Vasudeva and La!. \\nPYX spreads through rubbing, contact of plants and tubers, seed cutting, knife, farm \\nimplements, clothing and animal fur. In stores it can spread by sprout contact also. In \\nnature a wide range of PYX-infected plant species including weeds (Dahlia, Solanum sps) \\nserve as the source of virus infection. \\nTransmission is through sap. It spreads through contact between the healthy and \\ndiseased plant, core grafting and dodder. However it perennates in the diseased seed \\nstocks. Average tuber infection varies from 13-23%. PYX causes 10-30% yield loss. But \\nthe combined effect of PYX and PVY causes severe disease and reduce yield loss \\ndrastically.166 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nTRANSMISSION OF PLANT VIRUSES \\nPlant viruses are obligate parasites and to survive they must be spread from one \\nsusceptible host plant to another like other disease causing agents. The property of \\ntransmissibility is a fundamental characteristic of virus also. For years the transmission \\nof virus provided the only experimental evidence of its existence as an independent entity. \\nThe spread of virus or transmission of virus occurs in the following ways:-\\n(i) Mechanical transmission \\n(ii) Vegetative and graft transmission \\n(iii) Dodder transmission \\n(iv) Pollen and seed transmission \\n(v) Nematode and fungal transmission \\n(vi) Insect transmission \\n~~ \\nAphid Aphid feeding on leaf Aphid \\n(wingless) (winged) \\n~ Treehopper \\nLeafhopper \\n-Planthopper \\n~ Whitefly \\nPsylla \\ne\\'· \"~ .. \\n\\'.-\\nMealy bug \\nU[ ~ \\n5l . c:: . \\n·f Thrips \\n.r:. \\nPlant bug \\nBeetle Grasshopper \\no \\nFig. 5 : Insect vectors of plant viruses \\nThe organism who transport the virus from one plant to another is called vectors. \\nThey introduce viruse into plant tissues.

In humans the viral disease are known since the ancient times in India and \\nchina for example Small pox, Influenza, and common cold. Viral disease like small pox \\nwas linked to super natural causes and people used to perform offerings to goddess, \\'Shitala\\' \\nthroughout the country assuming that shitala had incarnated in the sufferers. Animal \\nviruses have the same type of components as plant and bacterial viruses. They have the \\nvirion or the virus particle made up of the viral capsid which is made up of protein \\ncontaining inside nucleic acid either DNA or RNA. The virus architecture is of two types \\nhelical (rod shaped, cylindrical) or icosahedral (spherical, quasispherical). For example the \\nadenovirus is icosahedral, where as rabies virus is bullet shaped. Unlike plant and bacterial \\nviruses the animal pathogenic virus contain an extra envelop outside the protein coat. This \\nenvelope is generally derived from the host cell membrane, but modified by insertion of \\nvirallyencoded glycoproteins and removal of host membrane protein during virus maturation. \\nThese enveloped viruses are sensitive to drying and treatment with acid and detergent. They \\nmust remain wet to retain membrane integrity and therefore must be transmitted through \\nblood, body fluids, respiratory droplets. The progeny particles of enveloped viruses are \\nreleased from the host cell by budding. Non-enveloped viruses are released by the lysis \\nof the host cell. They are resistant to drying and treatment with acid and alcohol. \\nREPLICATION OF ANIMAL VIRUSES \\nThe replication of animal viruses differ from phages in mechanism of entering the \\nhost cell (because they are eukaryotic and other is prokaryotic in nature). The steps in \\nthe process of reproduction is: \\n(i) Adsorption/ Attachment. \\n(ii) Penetration.170 \\n(a) Direct penetration. \\n(b) Fusion with plasma membrane. \\n(c) Endocytosis. \\n(iii) Uncoating. \\n(iv) Replication of viral nuclei acids. \\nTEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(v) Assembly of virus particles and Release of virus particle. \\n1. Adsorption! Attachment \\nThe virus particles get absorbed to the plasma membrane of the host cells by binding \\nto specific sites where the receptor proteins (usually glycoproteinsl are situated. The \\npresence of these receptor proteins is crucial in the viral infection and it may determine \\nhost resistance or susceptibility. The receptor proteins are usually surface proteins \\nnecessary for the host cell, as these proteins are also receptors for hormones and other \\nimportant molecules which get into the cell and are essential to the cell\\'s function. The \\nvirus mimics these essential molecules and manages to get into the cell by endocytosis. \\nMany host receptor proteins are related to immunolgobulins. For example HIV CD4 \\nreceptor, and the polio ICAM (intercellular adhesion molecule) receptor. In some cases \\ntwo or more cell receptors may be involved. The surface site on the viral particle will \\nbe an array of specific proteins. Envelope glycoproteins may also be involved in adsorption \\nin enveloped viruses. The herpes simplex virus has two glycoproteins that are involved \\nin adsorption. In adenoviruses, the projections extending from the corners of the capsid \\nplaya role in binding to host cell receptors. Spikes of some enveloped viruses also play \\nsimilar roles (myxovirus). For example, the influenza virus has two kinds of spikes, \\nhaemagglutinin, and neutraminidase. The haemogglutinin (H spike) attach to the host \\ncell receptor site and recognize siatic acid (N-acetyl neuraminic acid). The N spike \\n(Neuraminidase) helps the virus in penetrating the nasal and respiratory tract secretions \\nby degrading mucosal polysaccharides. However the receptor sites vary from person to \\nperson. \\n2. Penetration and Uncoating \\n(a) and (b) Direct penetration or fusion with plasma membrane \\nSome non-enveloped viruses such as the polio virus, undergo changes in capsid \\nstructure on adsorption to the plasma membrane, and release only their nucleic acids into \\nthe host cell. In the paramyxoviruses, and some other enveloped viruses, the capsids fuse \\nwith host cell plasma membrane. Fusion occurs between the envelope glycoprotins and \\nthe host plasma membrane proteins. Then the membrane lipids rearrange forming a \\nproteinaceous fusion pore. The nucelocapsid enters the host cell where uncoating take \\nplace. \\n(c) Endocytosis \\nEnveloped viruses may enter the host cell in another way. The virions attach to \\nspecialized regions on the membrane coated on the cytoplasmic side with protein clathrin. \\nThe coated regions pinch off to form coated vesicles filled with virus particles. The vesiclesTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 171 \\nfuse with lysosomes after the coating is removed. The lysosomal enzymes help in the \\nuncoating process. \\n3. Uncoating \\nThis is a process of separation of viral nucleic acid from the protein coat. This \\nprocess is not fully understood. In some viruses the coating is done by lysosomal enzymes \\nof the host cell which degrade protein coat and make the nucleic acid free in cytoplasm. \\nIn Pox virus the viral DNA synthesizes a specific protein after infection. Thus it varies \\nwith virus groups. \\n4. (i) Replication of DNA Viruses \\nThe genes which express early are the ones which are meant to execute host cell \\narrest. The virulent animal viruses arrest all the functions of the host cell such as DNA, \\nRNA and protein synthesis. The virus DNA replication usually takes place in the host \\nnucleus using host DNA polymerase-II, except in the poxviruses (such as vaccinia) whose \\ngenomes replicate in the cytoplasm. In most viruses, early transcription occurs using host \\nenzymes (polymerases) except in poxvirus where early mRNA is transcribed by a viral \\npolymerase. \\nThe genome of some viruses are too small to have enough genes for their replication \\n(e.g., Parvoviruses). The Parvovirus has the genome to code for three polypeptides which \\nare components of the capsid. The DNA of the virus is single stranded and linear. The \\nDNA being very small has to replicate in the host nucleus during the host DNA replication \\nusing the host DNA polymerases. This virus is usually associated with adenovirus and \\ncalled adeno-associated virus. Replication along with the adenovirus will help the virus \\nto replicate in a dependent way. \\nHepatitis-B virus (a number of Hepadnavirus group) is an enveloped virus with \\nan incomplete dsDNA genome. It has a genome replication strategy similar to that of the \\nretroviruses. Its genome is first completed and circularized in the cytoplasm, and \\ntransported to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the mRNAs are transcribed. Nucleocapsid is \\nassembled in the cytoplasm along with virally coded reverse transcriptase. The DNA is \\nsynthesized inside the virion by reverse transcribing RNA copies of the genome. \\nHerpesviruses are dsDNA viruses with icosahedral enveloped virions causing \\nimportant human and animal diseases. The genome-contains 50-100 genes. Upon \\nuncoating, the DNA is transcribed by the host RNA polymerase to form mRNAs to direct \\nthe synthesis of early proteins, the enzymes required for DNA replication, DNA replication \\ntakes place in the nucleus with the formation of virus-specific DNA polymerase. Host \\nDNA synthesis slows down. \\nPoxviruses (e.g., vaccinia) are the largest animal viruses known and are also most \\ncomplex. The double-stranded DNA contain\\'> around 200 genes. The virus enters through \\nendocytosis in coated vesicles. The central core of the virus contains DNA and DNA \\ndependent RNA polymerase that synthesizes the early mRNAs. DNA polymerases and \\nother enzymes needed for the DNA replication are also synthesized in the early part of \\nthe reproductive cycle, DNA replication begins about 1.5 hours after infection. After DNA172 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nreplication late mRNA transcription begins. Many late proteins are structural proteins \\nused in capsid formation. The complete reproductive cycle takes about 24 hours. \\nReplicative form \\n++ --=-+-\\nProgeny S +--~+-~ --... \\ngenomes~ \\nRelea!:-tt \\nAssembly \\n--....... \\nTranslation \\nViral protein \\n, \\nCleavage \\nRNA-dependentt t .*. \\nRNA polymerase ., \\nStructural \\nproteins \\nFig. 1 : Replication of positive single-stranded RNA viruses \\nTranscription Translation \\n-- +t \\\\ nl H\"-\\' ~.

The \\nantigenomic copy is now used as a template for the replication of the genome. The late \\nviral genes are transcribed from the viral genome, resulting in capsid proteins. \\nRetroviruses (e.g. HIV) have a positive sense RNA genome but employ a different \\nstrategy for genome replication as they first give rise to a complementary DNA molecule \\nby reverse transcription using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. The single stranded DNA \\ncopy serves as a template for the synthesis of a double stranded DNA (the provirus), by \\na cellular DNA polymerase. Provirus is then transcribed by the cellular enzymes to make \\nthe viral mRNA and viral genome RNA. \\nIn viruses with negative sense RNA (e.g., Orthomyxoviruses and Paramyxoviruses), \\nthe genome is associated with a RNA polymerases which transcribes an antigenomic copy \\nof the genome which is used as the template for virus genome replication. \\n5. Assembly and Release of Virus Particles \\nThe late expressing genes direct the synthesis of capsid proteins. Once enough \\nprotein and DNA are synthesized the two will spontaneous assemble to form virus \\nparticles, as in the case plant viruses. In icosahedral virus assembly, it appears that the \\nempty procapsids are first formed and then the nucleic acid is then inserted into the empty \\ncapsid in some unknown way. The assembly of enveloped viruses follows the same pattern \\nNucleocapsid --f\\'*~-=;--:CI \\nNaked icosahedral Enveloped icosahedral \\nNucleocapsid l~~~~.\"\\': \\nNaked nelical \\nEnveloped helical \\nFig. 5 : Symmetry of viruses: (a) icosahedral; (b) helicalTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 175 \\nexcept in the case of pox viruses which follow more complicated pattern and assemble \\nin the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. \\nThe mechanism of virion release differ between non-enveloped (naked) and enveloped \\nviruses. The virions of naked viruses are released by the lyse of the host cell. In the \\nenveloped viruses, the formation of the envelope and the release of the virus particle is \\na concurrent process. The viral capsid proteins are first attached to the plasma membrane, \\nand the nucleocapsid is formed on the membrane. The nucelocapsid is released by \\nmembrane budding, and the capsids carry the membrane in the process of budding and \\nreleased. Actin filaments of the host cytoskeleton can aid in virion release. \\nCLASSIFICATION \\nThe classification of animal viruses is based on the nature of the nucleic acids (DNA \\nor RNA, double stranded or single stranded linear or circular + or -strand), shape of \\nvirus particle, presence or absence of envelope and nature of disease caused. \\nBaltimore (1971) classified animal viruses in the following six groups according to \\nthe relationship between virion, nucleic acid and mRNA transcription. The RNA within \\nthe virion is known as (+) or sense strand because it acts as mRNA whereas newly \\nsynthesized RNA which is complementary in base-sequence to the original infectious \\nstrand is called minus (-) or antisense strand. It acts as template to produce additional \\n(+) strand which may acts as mRNA. \\nClass I dSDNA viruses \\nThe mRNA is synthesized on a dSDNA genome template (± dSPNA ~ (+) mRNA) \\nwhich usually occurs in a cell. Ex- Vaccinia virus, Adenovirus, Herpes simplex virus type \\nI and type II. \\nClass 2 SSDNA viruses \\nIn such viruses an intermediate DNA is synthesized before the synthesis of mRNA \\ntranscript (+ SSDNA ~ + mRNA). The mRNA has same polarity as the DNA. Ex\\xad\\nParvovirus, Mouse Minute virus. \\nClass 3 (+) SSRNA virus \\nThe RNA has similar polarity as the mRNA. Viruses of this class are grouped into \\ntwo classes. \\nSub class 3a: Individual mRNA encodes a polyprotein which is broken later on \\nto form viral protein. Ex- Poliovirus \\nSub class 3b: From (+) SSRNA two types of mRNA molecules are transcribed one \\nis of same length as virion RNA and the other is a fragment of virion e.g Dengu virus, \\nYellow fever and St. Louis Encephalites virus. \\nClass 4 (-) SSRNA \\nThe virion RNA is complementary to mRNA. They are divided mto two sub classes. \\n(a) Sub class 4a: The SSRNA genome encodes a series of monocistronic mRNA. \\nEx: Mumps virus, Measles virus.176 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(b) Sub class 4b: Each segment molecule of the genome acts as template for the \\nsynthesis of mRNA which are monocistronic or encodes polyprotein. Ex-Human influenza \\nvirus, Lassa virus. \\nClass 5 dSRNA viruses \\nAll the viruses of this class have segmented genome. Each chromosome encodes \\na single polypeptide. The dSRNA acts as template and asymmetrically synthesize (+) \\nmRNA. Ex- Reovirus of humans \\nClass 6 RNA-DNA viruses \\nIn these viruses (+) SSRNA directs the synthesis of (-) DNA which in turn acts \\nas template for the transcription of mRNA (RNA ~ (-) DNA 4 + RNA), Virion \\nRNA and mRNA are of the same polarity e.g.-Rous Sarcoma virus, Mouse leukemia \\nvirus. \\nClass 7 DNA- RNA virus \\nThis group consists of DNA containing hepatitis B viruses. \\nCharacteristics \\n1 \\nSingle-stranded \\nDNA, non-\\nenveloped \\nDouble-stranded \\nDNA, non-\\nenveloped \\nDouble-stranded \\nDNA, enveloped \\nViral family \\n2 \\nParvoviridae \\nAdenoviridae \\nTABLE 1 \\nClassification of Human Viruses \\nViral genus (with Dimensions Clinical or special features \\nrepresentative of virion \\nspecies) and Un- (Diameter \\nclassified members in nm) \\n3 4 5 \\nDepelldoviTlls 18-25 Depend on coinfection with \\nadenoviruses; cause fetal death, \\ngastroenteritis \\nMastadelloviTlls 70-90 Medium-sized viruses that cause \\n(adenovirus) various respiratory infections in \\nhumans; some cause tumors in \\nanimals. \\nPapovadridae PapillomaviTlls 40-57 Small viruses that induce tumors; \\n(human wart virus) the human wart virus (papilloma) \\nPolyolllaviTlls and certain viruses that produce \\ncancer in animals (polyoma and \\nsimian) belong to this family. \\nPoxviridae OrtilOpoxvims 200-350 Very large, complex, brick-shaped \\n(Vaccinia and viruses that cause diseases such \\nsmallpox viruses) as smallpox (variola), molluscum \\nMolIllScipOl:viTlls contagiosum (wartlike skin lesion), \\ncowpox, and vaccinia. \\nHerpesviridae Simp/exvirus (herpes 150-200 Medium-sized viruses that cause \\nsimplex viruses 1 various human diseases, such as \\nand 2) Varicellavirus fever blisters, chickenpox, shingles, \\n(varicella-zoster and infectious mononucleosis; \\nvirus) implicated in a type of human \\nContd ...THE ANIMAL VIRUSES \\n...

The genome consists of a single linear molecule \\nof single-stranded RNA of positive polarity with 7-8 kilobase pairs.

Enteroviruses \\nare among the most stable viruses. They can remain viable for years at -20°C or -70°C \\nand for months at 4°C. In faeces, at room temperature, the virus can remain infective for \\nseveral weeks. Being non enveloped they are insensitive to ether, chloroform and \\ndeoxycholate. The virus is readily killed by moist heat at 50-55°C, but in food stuffs the \\nvirus may survive exposure to 60°C and holder method of pasteurization. Enteroviruses \\nare rapidly inactivated by ultraviolet light, drying, formaldehyde (0.3%), hydrochloric acid \\n(0.1 M) or free residual chlorine (0.3-0.5 ppm). However, higher concentrations of chlorine \\nare necessary to inactivate virus in the presence of organic matter because the latter \\ndiminishes the activity of chlorine. \\nComposition: The RNA genome constitutes about one quarter of the virion. The RNA \\nis single stranded and of positive sense and can be translated directly by host ribosome. \\nThe capsid consist of a protein shell arranged in icosahedral symmetry around the RNA \\nmolecule. Four major peptides are reCOgnized in the shell VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4 and \\nare formed from a single precursor protein VP 0 by proteolytic cleavage. Specific neutralizing \\nantibodies are considered to be the major mechanism of protection against infection. \\nThe three groups of viruses those designated as enteroviruses have a number of \\nfeatures in common. \\n• They attach to cells in the intestinal tract by specific receptor sites and replicate \\nin cells of the intestinal tract. \\n• They commonly cause asymptomatic immunizing infections, which protect \\nagainst future infections with the same virus.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 181 \\n• They can give rise to viraemia. \\n• They occasionally cause infection of CNS and other target organs. \\n• They are commoner in children than adult. \\n• In temperate climate they cause infections usually in the summer and autumn. \\nPOLIOVIRUSES \\nOn the basis of neutralization tests, polioviruses can be divided into three serotypes. \\nType 1 is the common epidemic type, type 2 is usually associated with endemic infections \\nand type 3 occasionally causes epidemics. The size chemical properties and physical \\nproperties and resistance of the three types are all identical and so their antigenic \\nproperties provide one of the main method to differentiation. These viruses have affinity \\nfor nervous tissue and narrow host range. Only man and some primates like cynomologous \\nand rhesus monkeys are susceptible. These monkeys can be infected by the oral route \\nand develop paralysis. \\nConsiderable interest was generated in poliomyelitis after 1916 when more than \\n27,000 persons were paralysed and 6,000 died in a major epidemic in the USA which \\nhad mainly hit the adult population. \\nNatural infection occurs only in man. The virus is spread from man to man by faecal\\xad\\noral route and because early multiplication occurs in both the or9phanynx and the \\nintestinal mucosa, therefore, the virus is also spread by pharyngeal secretions (droplet \\ninfection) during first week of illness. No intermediate host is known. \\nOn entering the body of a new host the virus multiplies in then tonsils and peyer\\'s \\npatches of the ileum. Spread to regional lymph nodes (cervical and mesenteric) leads to \\na viraemia, enabling the virus to become disseminated throughout the body including cord \\nand brain. \\nPathogenesis \\n1. Neural spread may occur in children with inapparent infection at the time of \\ntonsillectomy. Poliovirus present in the orophanynx may enter nerve fibres \\nexposed during surgery and spread to brain resulting in bulbar paralysis. \\n2. A similar mechanism of viral spread via neural pathways may be responsible \\nfor paralysis of a limb recently injected with inflammatory injections such as \\ndiphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vaccine. This is probably associated with the \\nirritant properties of the adjuvant. \\n3. Pregnancy increases the incidence of paralysis. \\n4. Muscular activity during the paralytic phase of the illness may lead to paralysis \\nof the limbs used. \\nClinical Features \\nThere are three types of poliovirus infection: \\n(1) Asymptomatic or mild infection, transient \\'influenza like\\' illiness. The virus is182 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nexcreted in the faces for a limited time and an immunological response develops \\nwhich protect against re-infection with the same strain. \\n(2) Infection with same symptom and involvement of CNS with headache, fleck \\nstiffness and back pain (meningitis). Rapid and complete necessary is less than \\n10 days is usual. \\n(3) Paralytic poliomyelitis in which patient develops paralysis. This is very \\nuncommon, occurring in one in 1000 of polio virus infection in children. The \\nparalysis is flaccid due to destruction of lower motor neurons, although inv.asion \\nof the brain stem cells by virus can lead to inco-ordination of muscle groups \\nand painful spasms. Paralysis occur early in the illness but the extent is \\ninvariable. Damage to the nerve cells in the brain stem can lead to the inability \\nto swallow and breathe. \\nIn the CNS the virus multiples selectively in the neurons and destroy them. \\nProphylaxis \\nThe WHO had set a target date of the year 2000 as the global eradication of \\npoliomyletis. Although overall the number of cases has fallen more than 95%.30 countries \\nof South Asia and West and Central Africa has recent reports of the cases. A new dead \\nline has set to be 2005. The eradication has been attempted with annual national \\nimmunization days to ensure each child receives an adequate number of doses of oral \\npoliovaccine. \\nTwo effective vaccines are available: \\n• Inactivated polio vaccine (Salk), and \\n• Live attenuated oral polio vaccine (Sabin) \\nInactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) \\nIPV (Salk) for parental injection was developed by Jonas Salk in 1956. The vaccine \\ncontains formalin inactivated strains of the three serotypes of virus grown in monkey \\nkidney cell culture. The vaccine is given by deep subcutaneous or intra-muscular injection. \\nThree injection are given with intervals of 6-8 weeks between the first and second doses \\nand 4-6 months between the second and third doses. IPV produces long-lasting immunity \\nto all three poliovirus types. It is not associated with local or general reactions. The \\ninjection of this vaccine stimulates the production of IgG antibodies in the serum. It \\ndoes not induce detectable levels of secretory IgA in the gut and therefore would not be \\nexpected to prevent alimentary tract infections. Following infection, a virulent virus is \\nneutralized as it enters the blood stream, thus preventing involvement of the central \\nnervous system. The absence of live virus makes it safe to administer to immuno\\xad\\ncompromised individuals. \\nLive Attenuated Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) \\nOPV (Sabin) was developed by Albert Sabin in 1962. It contains live attenuated \\nstains of the three serotypes of poliovirus grown either in cultures of monkey kidney cellsTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 183 \\nor human diploid cells. The virus comprising the vaccine is unable to multiply in the \\ncells of the central nervous system and therefore lacks neurovirulence. The vaccine is \\nadministered orally and parallels natural infection. It stimulates both local secretory IgA \\nantibodies in the pharynx and alimentary tract and humoral IgG antibodies. Virus is \\nexcreted in the faeces for several weeks, during which time the vaccine may spread to \\nclose contacts, inducing or boostering immunity in them. \\nAt the age of one and a half months first dose of OPV is given along with DPT. \\nSecond, third and fourth doses of these vaccines are given at the ages of 21/ 2, 31/ 2 and \\n16-24 months, respectively. With multiple rounds of replication in the vaccine and after \\ntransmission to the contact, there is a theoretical possibility that the vaccine virus may \\nrevert to neurovirulence. The risk of vaccine-associated poliomyelitis has been estimated \\nat between 0.5 and 3.4 cases per million. OPV used in India is stated to contain Type \\n1 virus 10 lakh, Type 2 virus 2 lakh and type 3 virus 3 lakh, TCTD 50 per dose (0.5 \\nml). The shelf life of vaccine at 4-8°C is 4 months and at -20°C is 2 years. \\nCOXSACKI~VIRUSES \\nThese viruses were named so because the first isolation was made from Coxsackie \\nvillage in New York by Dalldrof and Sickles (1948). Based on the pathological changes \\nproduced in suckling mice, coxsackieviruses are classified into two groups, A and B. \\nTABLE 4 \\nCoxsackieviruses \\nGroup A \\nPathological changes induced by Generalized myositis \\nInoculation of suckling mice Flaccid paralysis \\nDeath within a week \\nNumber of types by 23 (1-24 except 23) \\nneutralization test \\nGroup B \\nPatchy focal myositis \\nSpastic paralysis \\nLocalized lesions in the \\nliver, pancreas, \\nmyocardium brain and \\nbrown fat pads. \\n6(1-6) \\nLike other enterovirues, coxsackievirues inhabit the alimentary canal primarily and \\nare spread by faecal-oral route. They may cause following lesions: \\nGroup A Viruses \\nCoxsackie A virus: Group A virus of which there are 24 serotype cause widespread \\nsever myosites of skeletal muscles and in life the mice appears to have a flaccid paralysis. \\nThe sign of infection appears 4 or 5 days after inoculation and progress until the animal \\ndies 4 or 5 days later. \\nCoxsackie B Virus: Group B virus of which there are six, cause widespread lesions \\nin many organs. The myositis produced is characterized by focal lesions and spastic184 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nparalysis. The virus cause areas of necrosis in the brown fat lobules, meningo-encephalitis \\nand pancreatis. The incubation period of B virus in mice is prolonged. \\nThese viruses give rise to: \\n1. Aseptic meningitis: It is caused by types 2, 4, 7 and 9. \\n2. Herpangina (vesicular pharyngitis): It is caused by types 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10. \\nIt is usually seen in young children. Outbreaks may be seen in nurseries and schools. \\nThere is an abrupt onset of fever and sore throat. The illness is self-limited. \\n3. Hand-foot and - mouth disease: It is usually caused by types 5 and 16 and \\nis predominantly a childhood illness. The disease presents as a painful stomatitis with \\na vesicular rash on the hands and feet. \\nGroup B viruses \\n1. Epidemic myalgia (Bornholm disease): It is so called because it was first \\ndescribed on the Danish island\\' of Bornholm. It is a febrile disease with stitch-like pains \\nin the muscles of the chest (intercostals), epigastrium or hypochondrium. lnvovlement of \\ndiaphragm leads to abdominal pain. \\n2. Myocarditis and pericarditis: Group B viruses may lead to severe and often fatal \\nmyocarditis in newborn infants. Myocarditis and pericarditis may also occur in children \\nand adults. \\n3. Aseptic meningitis: Group B viruses may cause aseptic meningitis sometimes with \\nparalysis. \\nEchoviruses \\nThese viruses were originally isolated from the faeces of persons who had no \\nclinical illness and caused a cytopathic effect in cell culture. Therefore, these viruses \\nwere given the name of enteric cytopahtogeneic human orphan viruses (echoviruses). \\nOn the basis of the presence of a type-specific neutralizing antigen in their capsid, \\nechoviruses have been sub-divided into 34 (1-34 except 10 and 28) types. All echoviruses \\ngrow well in human and simian kidney cultures. They infected only human beings \\nnaturally. \\nMost of the echoviruses produce asymptomatic infections but some have been \\nassociated with clinical syndromes such as aseptic meningitis, paralysis, fever with rash, \\nrespiratory disease (pneumonia, bronchiolitis and upper respiratory tract illness), infantile \\ndiarrhoea, pericarditis and myocarditis. \\nEchoviruses can be readily isolated from nose and throat swabs, stools or CSF on \\nhuman diploid embryonic lung fibroblast and human rhabdomyoisarcoma cell line. The \\ncytopathic effect and the identification of the virus type is similar to that of coxsackieviruses. \\nVaccination has not been attempted. \\nEnteroviruses 68-71 \\nOf the four enteroviruses 68-71, three are associated with disease in human beings.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 185 \\nEnterovirus type \\n68 \\n69 \\n70 \\n71 \\nTABLE 5 \\nDiseases Produced by Enteroviruses 68-71 \\nDisease \\nPneumonia and bronchitis \\nAcute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, mening<;>encephalitis and \\nparalysis \\nMeningoencephalitis and paralysis \\nEnterovirus 70: In 1969, a pandemic of acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) \\nspread throughout Africa and Asia. Recently, the disease occurred in Mexico. AHC is \\nhighly infectious, has an incubation period of about 24 hours and the symptoms are \\nsudden swelling, congestion, watering and pain in the eyes. Although sub conjunctival \\nhaemorrhage is a characteristic feature, most cases recover in 3-7 days. Sometimes \\nenterovirus 70 may cause meningoencephalitis and paralysis. It can be isolated on human \\nembryonic kidney and HeLa cells. \\nRhinoviruses \\nThe common cold is probably the most common infectious disease of human. \\nRhinovirus term was applied to this group (rhino referring to \\'nose\\' the organ primarily \\naffected). \\nThey differ from enterovirus is being more acid labile, but more heat stable. They \\nare inactivated below pH 6. They are relatively stable at 20-37>C and may remain viable \\nfor days. Over 100 serotypes has been classified on the basis of their type specific antigen. \\nThe virus attaches to receptors on nasal ciliated epithelial cells, enters and replicates \\nwithin them spreading to other cells. \\nRhinoviruses are small RNA viruses, morphologically and biochemically similar to \\nother members of the family picomaviridae. They can be differentiated from the enteroviruses \\non the basis of their acid lability (thus their inability to infect the intestinal tract) and \\ntheir optimal temperature for replication (33°C). They are inactivated below pH 5. They \\nare relatively stable in temperature, range of 20-37°C and can survive on environmental \\nsurfaces such as door knobs for several days. Some rhinoviruses may survive heating at \\n50°C for 1 hour. They are resistant to 20% ether and 5% chloroform but are sensitive to \\naldehydes and hypochlorites. They can be preserved at -70°C. \\nSome strains grow in both monkey & human cell lins, these are designated as M \\nstrains and those which grow only in human cells are known as H strains. \\nPathogenesis \\nRhinoviruses are the major cause of common cold accounting for about half of all \\ncolds. Other viruses which may also cause common cold include corona viruses, some \\nenteroviruses particulary coxsackieviruses A21 and A24 and echoviruses 11 & 20,186 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nrespiratory syncytial virus, para influenza viruses and the low numbered adenoviruses. \\nRhinoviruses are transmitted by inhalation of droplets expelled from the nose of a patient \\nduring sneezing and coughing. During the acute phase of the illness high concentrations \\nof virus are present in nasal secretions which may contaminate hands, fingers, handkerchiefs \\nor paper tissues, door knobs, etc and the normal individuals who touch these, contaminate \\ntheir fingers which may touch the eye or nasal mucosa leading to cold. For rhinoviruses, \\nhand contact seems to be the prime mode of transmission. Rhinovirus infections are \\nobserved throughout the year, but the incidence of cold in temperate climates increases \\nin the autumn and spring and in the tropics the peak incidence occurs in the rainy \\nseason. \\nAfter an incubation period of 2-4 days, patient develops profuse watery discharge \\n(rhinorrhoea) with nasal obstruction, sneezing, sore throat, cough, headache, malaise and \\nlittle or no fever. On an average, symptoms subside in about a week but in a proportion \\nof the cases the symptoms may be prolonaged for 2 weeks or longer. Sinusitis or otitis \\nmedia may supervene, particularly if secondary bacterial infection occurs. The illness is \\ngenerally worse in smokers. Recovery is mediated by endogenous interferons, locally \\nsynthesized IgA antibodies and serum IgG antibodies. The multiplicity of serotype makes \\nvaccination impossible. Interferon is usually detectable shortly after the peak of virus \\nshedding and probably playa part in recovery. Pleconaril is one such drug showing \\nactivity against rhinovirus and enterovirus. Good infection control practices including \\nhand washing will reduce spread of infection in the hospital setting. \\nRHABDOVIRUS \\nThe family Rhabdoviridae consist of more than 200 viruses of vertebrate, invertebrate \\nand plants. It has two genera. Vesiculovirus and Lyssavirus. The member of genus \\nvesiculovirus causes vesicular stomatitis in horses, cattle, and pigs and only one of the \\n35 serologically distinct viruses of this genus causes human infection. The genus lyssa \\nvirus contain rabies virus and five rabies like viruses: Mokola, Lagosbat, Kotonkan, \\nObodhiang and Duvenhage viruses. Each of these viruses are capable of causing rabies \\nlike disease in domestic animals and humans. \\nThe bite of an infected animal like dog, cat, bat or skunk can transmit the disease \\nto man. \\nMorphology \\n(Rabies name come from the latin word rabidus = mad) \\nRabies virus is bullet shaped 180 x 75 nm with one end rounded conical and the \\nother plane or concave. The core of the virion consists of a minus sense 11-12 Kb. Single \\nstranded (-) RNA enclosed in helically wound nucleocapsid. RNA dependent RNA \\npolymerase enzyme (required for initiation of replication of virus) is enclosed within the \\nvirion in association with the ribonucleoprotein core. This ribonucleoproein core is \\nsurrounded by viral membrane or matrix protein which may be invaginated at the plane. \\nend. The matrix protein is again surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope which carries \\nglycoprotein peplomers (spikes). The spikes do not cover the plane end of the virion.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 187 \\nSymptoms \\nThe symptom in human include severe headache and high fever with alternating \\nstages of excitement and depression. Patients have difficulty in swallowing and slight \\nstimuli incite muscular spasms in the throat and chest. Death may occur due to convulsive \\nseizures. The mortality rate in untreated patients is nearly 100%. The course of disease \\nin humans can be classified into four stages-prodrome, acute encephalitic phase, coma \\nand death. The onset is marked by prodromal symptoms like fever, headache, malaise, \\nfatigue, and anorexia. An early symptom is often a neuritic type of pain or Paresthesia \\nand fasciculation at the site of virus entry. Apprehension anxiety, agitation, irritability, \\nnervousness, insomnia or depression characterise the prodromal phase, last for 2-4 days. \\nExcessive libido, priapism, and spontaneous ejaculation may occur rarely. \\nThe acute neurological phase usually begins with hyperactivity with bouts of bizarre \\nbehaviour, agitation or seizures appearing between apparently normal periods. \\nSome patients progress to paralysis. Death is due to respiratory arrest or other \\ncomplications. \\nAfter the bite of a rabid animal the incubation period is usually between 1-2 months. \\nHowever it may be as short as 9 days and rarely as long as a year or more. It is shorter \\nin children than in adults and also in person bitten on face or head than bitten on the \\nlegs. This is related to the distance the virus has to travel to reach \\'the brain. Patients \\ndevelops difficulty in drinking, together with intense thirst. Attempts to drink bring on \\npainful spasm of pharynx and larynx producing choking and gagging. Therefore mere \\nsight or sound of water precipitates distressing muscular spasm leading to hydrophobia \\n(fear of water). \\nThe furious form of rabies, gradually subsides into delirium, convulsions coma and \\ndeath. Sometimes only the dumb form is seen, with symmetrical ascending paralysis \\nfollowed by coma and death. The disease, once developed is almost always fatal in 4-\\n14 days. Rabies virus may be secreted in the saliva, urine and other secretions of human \\nrabies victims as in that of animals . \\n.\\' .>\\'~ _ ~ .~ _\\' _I ~..:..ll..\\\\.~~~ Lipoprotein envelope \\nf\\'~~O~ \\n- ~ .

Rabies \\nvirus is excreted in the saliva of affected animals. Man acquires infection by the bite of \\nrabid dog or other animals. Rarely infection can occur following licks on abraded skin \\nand intact mucosa. Infection has occurred through the inhalation of massive virus aerosle \\ngenerated in bat caves and in laboratory accidents. \\nInfection by bite of rabid animal results in deposition of rabies infected saliva deep \\nin the striated muscles. The virus replicates in the muscle cell or cells of epithelial tissues. \\nAfter reaching a sufficient concentration it infects peripheral nerves in the muscle or skin. \\nOnce within the nerve fibres it is out of reach of any circulating anti body and travels \\nalong the axon towards the central nervous system at a speed of 3 mm per hour. In the \\ncentral nervous system it multiplies and produces encephalitis. The virus then spreads \\noutwards along the nerve trunks to various parts of the body including the salivary glands. \\nIt multiplies in the salivary glands and is shed in the saliva. There is little evidence that \\nhaematogenous or other modes of spread are involved. \\nThe presence of virus in the saliva and the irritability and aggression brought on \\nby the enc~phalitis ensure the transmission and survival of the virus in nature. The virus \\nultimately reaches virtually every tissue in the body and is almost invariably present in \\nthe cornea and the skin of face and nape of the neck of the patient because of their \\nproximity to the brain. This provides a method for the antemortem diagnosis of rabies. \\nThe virus may also be shed in the milk and wine.ln humans the incubation period is \\n1-3 months or may be as short as 7 days or as long as three years. \\nExposure of humans to rabies virus does not necessarily result in .infection. Contrary \\nto popular belief, man is not highly susceptible to the virus. The incidence of human rabies \\nafter bites by known rabid dogs is about 15%. However, the incidence ranges from \\n1 % after contamination of minor wounds to more than 60% after severe bites on the \\nface. \\nIn dogs the incubation period is usually 3-6 weeks but it may range from 10 days \\nto a year. The initial signs are an alert, troubled air and a change in disposition with \\nrestlessness Snapping at imaginary object licking or gnawing at the site of the bite. After \\n2-3 days of this prodromal stage the disease, develops into either the furious or dumb \\ntype of rabies. In furious rabies (more common) the dogs runs amok, biting without \\nprovocation & indiscriminately. The lower jaws droops and saliva drools from the mouth. \\nParalysis, convulsions and death follow. In dumb rabies the animal lies huddled, unable \\nto feed. The dog may not bite but attempts to feed it are dangerous. About 60% of rabid \\ndogs shed the virus in saliva. Rabid dogs usually die in 3-5 days. \\nThe characteristic histopathological feature in rabies is the intracytoplasmic inclusion \\nbody (Negri body) in the neurons, most abundant in cerebellum and hippocampus. \\nNegribodies are composed of a finely fibrillar matrix and rabies virus particles. \\nPhysical and chemical properties: The virus is sensitive to ethanol, iodine \\npreparations, quarternayr ammonium compounds, soap, detergents and lipid solvents like \\nether chloroform and acetone. It is inactivated by phenol, formalion, UV radiation andTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 189 \\nsunlight. It dies at room temperature but can survive for weeks when stabilized by 50% \\nglycerol. It can be preserved at -700C by lyophilisation. \\nTransmission: The portal of entry from the infected saliva of a rabid animals are: \\n• abrasions or scratches on the skin. \\n• mucous membrane exposed to saliva from licks. \\n• most frequently via deep penetrating bite wounds uncommon routes include: \\n• inhalation while in bat infested areas/ caves \\n• aerosols released during centrifugation of infected material in the laboratory. \\n• ingestion of flesh of rapid animals. \\n• corneal transplants. \\n• Humans do not figure as spreaders of rabies. \\nEpidemiology \\nRabies virus is present in animals in all parts of the world except Australia and \\nAntartica, and some islands like Britain. Two epidemiological types of rabies exist-urban, \\ntransmitted by domestic animals like dogs and cats, and sylva tic, involving animals in \\nthe wild, such as jackals, wolves, foxes, mongooses, skunks and bats. Most cases of human \\nrabies follow dog bites but in endemic areas almost any animal can transmit rabies. In \\nIndia, antirabic treatment is to be considered following the bite of any animal except rats. \\nWhere urban or domestic rabies has been controlled, as in the USA, the majority of \\ninfections are due to bites by wild animals. \\nThe primary source of the rabies virus in nature seems to be in the mustelids and \\nviverrids, the ermine in the northern coniferous forests, the skunk, mink and weasel in \\nNorth America, the mottled pole cat in the USSR, the civet and pole cat in Africa and \\nthe mongoose in Asia. Rabies virus has been isolated repeatedly from the brain and \\nsalivary glands of apparently healthy wild rodents. The virus survives in this reservoir \\npopulation by achieving a state of latency with occasional activation such that only a \\nsmall proportion of them will be shedding the virus at anyone time. \\'From the reservoir \\nspecies, wild vectors such as foxes, wolves and jackals acquire the infection and \\noccasionally epizootics occur in these species. Carnivorous animals may acquire the \\ninfection by eating carcasses containing the virus. From these species the disease spreads \\nto dogs and other domestic animals. \\nAnother natural cycle of rabies concerns bats. A fatal paralytic disease of cattle & \\nhumans was noticed in Central and South America and the west Indies early in the \\ntwentieth century. This was identified as rabies only years later. The disease was shown \\nto be transmitted by vampire bats that sweep down on their prey at night. Vampire bat \\nrabies had taken a heavy toll of cattle. Vampire bats may shed the rabies virus as \\nsymptomless carries over a period of several months. \\nRabies is ehdemic in India. It has been estimated that more than 30,000 people die \\nof rabies in India every year and more than 700,000 receive antirabies vaccine. Human \\nrabies can be checked by control of rabies in domestic animals, by registration, licensing190 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nand vaccination of pets and destruction of stray animals. With the dog population in \\nIndia estimated as over 16 million, the problem is immense. However, rabies can be \\neliminated only if the wild vectors such as jackals and foxes, and the reservoir mustelids \\nand viverrids are controlled. Rabies has been eliminated from islands like Britain and \\nJapan by rigid quarantine. Australia which has no native mustelid or viverrid population \\nhas no rabies. Eradication of rabies from countries like India with abundant wildlife may \\nnot be practicable. \\nVaccination \\nPasteur introduced vaccination after exposure to rabies in 1885 on the basis that \\na long incubation period should allow time for immunity to develop before the onset of \\nsymptoms. His vaccine was a crude extract of rabbit spinal cord containing virus \"fixed \\nas a result of serial passage. A well publicized early success established the procedure, \\nstill in use despite various vicissitudes. A phenolized brain suspension formed the basis \\nof the sample vaccine, used in the UK from 1919 until 1966. Its drawbacks included a \\nvariable but generally low potency, which necessitated a considerable number of daily, \\noften painful, injections, with an antibody response mainly of the IgM class. There was \\nalso the disadvantage that the amount of myelin in its nervous tissue content sensitized \\na proportion of those being immunized, estimated to range from 1 in 500 upwards so \\nthat many went on to develop an allergic type of encephalomyelitis. When the risk of \\na possible exposure to a rabid animal was assessed as only marginal, it was matter of \\ndebate whether the risk of rabies was greatest than the risk of allegric encephalomyelitis. \\nA suckling mouse brain vaccine was developed and contains much less myelin. \\nIt is claimed to have a five fold reduction or more in the incidence of allegric \\nencephalomyelitis, and is widely used in latin American countries. A non-neurogenic duck \\nembryo vaccine was used in the UK from, 1966 to 1976. A purified version has shown \\nincreased potency, but this vaccine has been superseded by cell culture vaccines, of which \\nthere are several types. Those available worldwide, through not necessarily used because \\nof their high cost, include: \\n• diploid cell vaccine \\n• rabies vaccine adsorbed \\n• purified chick embryo cell vaccine \\n• vero cell vaccine \\nThese all have good immunogenicity and safety. \\nThe diploid cell vaccine is the only one licensed in the UK for\\'both pre and post \\n-exposure prophylaxis and is the only vaccine recommended for intradermal administration. \\nSevere reactions are rare after use, though upto 20% may report minor local effects, and \\na smaller proportion report systematic, influenza-like or sensitization effects. Intradermal \\nvaccine is not recommended while antimalarials are in use because these may interfere \\nwith the immune response. Immuno-suppressed persons may show a poor response and \\nshould have antibody levels checked. \\nSeveral vaccine types and modes of delivery have been used in animals. Those usedTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 191 \\nin dogs and cats are given intramuscularly, and require boosting every 1-3 years \\ndepending on the vaccine type. Attempts have been made to control the infection in wild \\nanimals by the use of live-attenuated vaccines delivered orally. By carefully selecting \\ndesirable baits, such as chicken heads for foxes, successful vaccination programmes have \\nbeen carried out in several European countries. \\nWork continues on a number of recombinant and subunit vaccines, and an \\nalternative antibody preparations to use in humans. \\nControl \\nBecause rabies has a world wide distribution its complete elimination would need \\nthe eradication of infection from all susceptible animal species. First steps in this direction \\nhave been the use of vaccine-impregnated baits to reduce rabies in foxes in Europe and \\nCanada and Raccoons in the USA. Since most human exposure has resulted from contact \\nwith infected dogs and cats, vaccination of domestic dogs and cats combined with post\\xad\\nexposure prophylaxis for those exposed in specific incidents to suspect rabid animals and \\npre-exposure for those who may come in contact with such animals in the course of their \\nwork has reduced the number of human cases in many countries. Pre-exposure vaccination \\nis recomm~ded for the following groups: \\n• Laboratory workers handling the virus \\n• Those handling imported animals at animal quarantine centres, zoos, research \\ncentres and ports. \\n• Veterinarians and their technical staff \\n• Animal health inspectors \\n• Licensed bat handlers \\n• Travelers to enzootic areas if work involves handling animals or patients with \\nrabies. \\n• Those traveling more than a day\\'s journey from modern medical treatment. \\nPre-exposure immunization requires two injections of 1 ml of vaccine, given into \\nthe deltoid muscle 4 weeks apart. A test for neutralizing antibody is advised 4 weeks \\nlater. A re-inforcing dose is given at 12 months. A booster should be given after any \\npotential exposure. Those at high risk of exposure should have periodic antibody testing \\nand boosting as required every 6 months to 2 years. \\nClear signs of case reduction have come from the developed countries that have \\napplied this scheme, and now the need is to extend the procedure to other, particularly \\nenzootic, regions where dogs are the major reservoir of the virus. Past attempts to control \\nwild life rabies by such draconian measures as shooting and gassing have had short\\xad\\nlived effects. Species vary in their susceptibility to rabies and live vaccine strains that \\nmay be used for one species may be unsuitable for another. Extension to canine and other \\nspecies may become feasible when suitable oral vaccine strains are identified. A number \\nof vectors, such as vaccinia, raccoon pox virions, fowl pox, canary pox and adenovirus, \\nhave been used to express a recombinant rabies glycoprotein gene with successful \\ninduction of neutralizing antibody in a variety of animal species.192 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nROTA VIRUSES \\nRotavirus infections are usually mild to moderately severe in developed countries \\nbut can become very severe and cause high mortality in developing countries. Rotavirues \\nalso cause diarrhoea in the young of a wide variety of mammals and birds. In the early \\n1980s, a rotavirus (adult diarrhoea rotavirus, ADRV) was identified as the cause of \\noutbreaks of diarrhoea in children and adults in different parts of China. \\nMorphologically, rotaviruses are polyhedrons of 75 nm diameter displaying \\ncharacteristic sharp-edged double-shelled capsids, which in electron micrographs look like \\nspokes grouped around the hub of a wheel. The name \\'rotavirus\\' was derived from this \\nappearance which is pathogenomic. More detailed structural studies have shown that \\nthe double-shelled capsid is penetrated by a large number of channels and that it \\ncarries on the surface of 60 protrusions that consist of dimers of VP4 (viral protein 4) \\nmolecules. \\nThe genome of rotaviruses is located inside the inner core and consists of 11 \\nsegments of double-stranded RNA that can be easily extracted from viruses and separated \\nby polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All segments, except one, code for only one virus\\xad\\nspecific protein (VP), and gene-protein assignments have been completed for several \\nrotavirus strains. \\nRNA segments 1, 2 and 3 code for the inner core proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3, \\nrespectively: VP2 is the main scaffolding protein (core layer). RNA segment 6 codes for \\nthe inner capsid protein, VP6 which forms a middle layer interacting with the core protein \\nVP2 and the outer capsid proteins. VP6 carries epitopes specifying groups & sub groups. \\nSo far, seven different groups (A-G) have been identified. For groups A-E complex lack \\nof serological cross-reactivity has been proven. Within a group, all viruses share common \\nVP6 antigens but may be further differentiated into sub groups. Thus, within group A \\nthere are at least four subgroups (I, II, I + II, non - I, non - II), which are identified by \\nspecific antisera and monoclonal antibodies. Most of the human rotavirues are of group \\nA; the Chinese ADRV is a group B; group C rotaviruses cause occasional outbreaks in \\nhumans. The outer capsid (third layer) is formed by two proteins, VP7 a glycoprotein \\n(encoded by RNA, 7, 8 or 9 depending on strain), and VP4 (encoded by RNA 4). Both \\nsurface proteins carry neutralization -specific epitopes that define serotypes. VP4 is post\\xad\\ntranslationally cleaved into the VP5 and VP8 subunits; proteolytic cleavage is essential \\nfor infectivity. Six non-structural proteins (NSP1-NSP6) are coded for by RNAs 5, 7, 8 \\nor 9 (depending on strain), 10 and 11 (encoding NSP5 + NSP6), and have various functions \\nduring replication, mainly in morphogenesis. \\nSo far, 14 different VP7-specific serotypes (G types, derived from glycoprotein) and \\nover 20 different VP4- specific types (P types, derived from protease-sensitive protein) have \\nbeen distinguished. Whilst the correlation between G serotypes and genotypes is complete, \\nnot all P types have been confirmed as serotypes yet, and therefore the P serotype \\ndesignation differs from the P genotype designation, e.g., strain Wa being designated as \\nA/human/Wa(GIP1A[8]) etc. As VP7 and VP4 are coded for by different RNA segments, \\nthey can segregate independently, and a large variety of different G-P-type combinations \\nof rotaviruses have been observed after reassortment in vitro and in nature in vivo. AnimalsTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 193 \\nfrom which rotavirus can be readily isolated are cattle, sheep, horses, pigs, dogs, cats and \\nmice, but also elks, rabbits, monkeys and many others. \\nElectrophoresis of genomic RNA segments (PAGE) has been used to establish so\\xad\\ncalled \\'electropherotypes\\' of rotavirus isolates. Besides \\'long\\' and \\'short\\' electropherotypes \\n(differing in the rates of relative migration of RNA segments 10 & 11). Various minor \\ndifferences in the migration of corresponding segments have been recognized. These \\ndifferences have been utilizing extensively in epidemiological studies, but for many \\nsurveillance purposes and for vaccine development serological classification remains \\nessential. \\nPathogenesis and Immunity \\nRotaviruses replicate exclusively in the differentiated epithelial cells at the tips of \\nthe villi of the small intestine. New virus is produced after 10-12 h. Progeny virus is \\nreleased in large numbers into the intestinal lumen ready to infect other cells. Biopsies \\nshow atrophy of the villi with reactive crypt hyperplasia and lymphocytic infiltrates in \\nthe lamina propria. The cellular damage leads to malabsorption of nutrients, electrolytes \\nand water and the crypt hyperplasia to hypersecretion. An osmotic and secretory diarrhoea \\nwith vomiting and dehydration results. It has been established that the product of RNA \\n4, VP 4, holds a central position for replication, spread and pathogenicity of rotaviruses, \\nbut that products of other RNA segments also contribute to the development of disease. \\nIn particular NSP4 (encoded by RNA segment 10) has been recognized as a viral \\nenterotoxin. \\nThe infection is followed by a local, humoral and cell-mediated immune response \\nand is normally overcome within a week. Rotavirus-specific IgA enteric antibodies, which \\nare secreted into the gut, are the best known correlate of protection. Infection with one \\nserotype provides homotypic, and re-infection leads to partial heterotypic, protection. In \\nthe immunodeficient host, however, a persistent infection can occur with severe chromic \\ndiarrhoea. \\nClinical Symptoms \\nThe onset of symptoms is abrupt after a short incubation period of 1-2 days. \\nDiarrhoea and vomiting are seen in the majority of infected children and last for 2-6 days. \\nAlthough symptoms of respiratory tract infection are frequently observed at the time of \\nrotavirus infections, there is no evidence that rotaviruses replicate in the respiratory tract. \\nClinical symptoms can range from mild to very severe, in part depending on the rotavirus \\nstrain. Asymptomatic infections of neonates with \\'nursery strains\\' are not uncommon. It \\nhas been estimated that about half of all gastro-enteritis cases\\' in children requiring \\nadmission to hospital are caused by rotaviruses. Infection has been detected in older \\nchildren and adults, but is usually asymptomatic. Only in the elderly have outbreaks of \\ndiarrhoea due to rotavirus infection been observed. Rotavirus infections can be life\\xad\\nthreatening if children are already malnourished. Five million children under the age of \\n2 years die from diarrhoeal disease in developing countries each year, rotavirus infections \\naccount for about 20% of these deaths.194 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nEpidemiology \\nRotavirus infections occurs world wide. Most symptomatic infections are seen in \\nchildren under 2 years of age; by the age of 3 years, more than 90% of children have \\nbeen infected by most of the major serotypes. In family outbreaks there may be evidence \\nof sub clinical infection in older children and adults who may be the source of infection \\nfor young children in family or nursery outbreaks. The release of enormous numbers of \\nvirions during the \\'acute stage contributes to the easy transmission of the virus. Only a \\nfew virus particles are sufficient to cause disease in the susceptible host. Longer-lasting \\noutbreaks may be maintained by the ability of the virus to survive outside the body for \\nsome time. In temperate climates there is a pronounced seasonal incidence, with peaks \\nin the winter months occurring with \\'clock wise precision\\'. In tropical areas infections \\noccur evenly throughout the year. \\nVarious surveys in different parts of the world have shown that at any time there \\nis co-circulation of genomic ally and serologically different rotaviruses. In tropical and \\nsubtropical regions, high prevalence of G/P constellations are seen which are rare in \\ntemperate climates (e.g., G8P[6], G9P[11], G9P[6] viruses have recently emerged in a \\nnumber of countries of several continents). \\nAt the molecular level, several factors have been identified that can explain the \\ngenomic and antigenic variability of co-circulating rotavirus strains: \\n• Like the genomes of other viruses that depend on virion-associated, RNA\\xad\\ndependent RNA polymerases for their replication, rotavirus genomes undergo \\nfrequent point mutations that accumulate in time and give rise to lineages an,d \\nsub lineages. \\n• Rotaviruses, like other segmented RNA viruses, undergo extensive reassortment \\nin doubly infected cells. This has been shown to occur both in vitro and in vivo. \\nIf RNA segments coding for sub groups and serotype-specific proteins are \\ninvolved, antigenic shift can occur in reassortants. \\n• Rotaviruses may be transferred into humans from animal species, and this may \\ncontribute to the genomic variability. Human group A rotavirus isolates have \\nbeen described, the genome of which is very closely related to that of cat and \\ncattle rotaviruses. ADRVs of group B may have been derived recently from \\nanimals, perhaps rats. On the other hand, human group C rotaviruses are \\nsignificantly different from animal group C rotaviruses. \\n• Rotaviruses establishing chronic infections in immunodeficient hosts undergo \\nvarious forms of genome rearrangements, resulting in highly atypical RNA \\nprofiles. Evidence is now emerging that such rearrangements may occur more \\nfrequently than originally thought. \\n• Various combinations of these factors may occur e.g. reassortment of viruses \\nwith rearranged genomes, or point mutations combined w~th reassortment, \\nTreatment and Control \\nTherapy consists mainly of oral, sometimes intravenous, rehydration with fluids ofTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 195 \\nspecified electrolyte and glucose composition. Antimotility drugs (codein phosphate, \\nloperamide) are generally not advised for use in children, but recently developed \\nenkephalinase inhibitors (e.g. racecadotril) which decrease gut secretion but not motility \\nhave been given successfully to children. \\nAs with any infectious agent transmitted by the faecal-oral route, attention to \\nhygienic measures such as hand washing and disinfection of contaminated surfaces and \\nsafe disposal of faeces are very important. \\nFor a variety of reasons, rotavirus infections have so far resisted prevention by \\nwidespread vaccination. Co-circulation of several serotypes at a time occurs in populations \\nat risk, which is also reflected in poly typic serum antibody responses. Furthermore, it is \\nnot fully clear to what extent vaccination with one rota virus serotype cross-protects against \\nother serotypes. However , polyvalent \\'cocktail\\' vaccines containing two or more different \\nserotypes have been shown to have a significant effect on prevention severe disease. One \\nof them, a rhesus rotavirus-based tetravalent human reasortant vaccine (RRV -TV, \\nRotashiled™), had been licensed in the USA in 1998 for universal use, and over 1.5 million \\ndoses (three doses per child at the ages of 2, 4 and 6 months) were administered over \\nthe following year. However, the vaccine had to be revoktd and taken off the market when \\na strong epidemiological link between application of the first (and second) dose of the \\nvaccine and the development of gut intussuspcetion became apparent. \\nA nUIllber of different candidate vaccines of live-attenuated rotavirus of bovine or \\nhuman origin, including bovine rotavirus monreassortants carrying human VP7 genes of \\ndifferent serotypes, are currently being evaluated. Baculovirus-expressed virus-like particles, \\nDNA-based vaccines and micro-encapsidated viral proteins or cDNAs are also being \\nexplored. It is hoped that (an) efficient rotavirus vaccine(s) will become available in the \\nnot too distant future. \\nACQUIRED IMMUNE \\'DEFICIENCY SYNDROME; LYMPHOMA HIV VIRUS \\nVirions of the family Retroviridae possess reverse transcriptase enzyme hence the \\nname (Re: reverse, tr: trnscriptase) The family retroviridae has been .divided into 3 sub \\nfamilies of the seven genera included in this family three contain human retroviruses. \\nHuman T celllymphotrophic virus Type 1 (HTLV-l) is an oncogenic virus. It causes adults \\nT cellieukaemia/iumphoma . HTLV-2 is prevalent in intravenous drug users, but has not \\nbeen associated with disease. They have been studied in the laboratory for many years, \\ninitially because some are associated with tumour production in their natural hosts. \\nIndeed, a wide variety of tumours are caused by the oncovirus genus, including leukaemias \\nand lymphomas, sarcomas, breast and brain tumours, auto-immune disease and blood \\ndisorders. The host species include birds, mice, cattle, pigs and several primates. Despite \\nintense effort, it was not until 1980 that the first human retrovirus was isolated from the \\nT cells of patients with T cell leukaemia-the human T lymphotropic virus type-lor HTLV-\\n1. Since then, the cause of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been \\nshown to be a retrovirus, also with a predilection for T cells but differing significantly \\nfrom HTLV-l . It is known as the human immuno deficiency virus type lor HIV-l . Infection \\nwith this virus has become pandemic and is a major cause of mortality in sub-saharan196 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nAfrica and other developing countries. Infection with the related HIV-2 is restricted largely \\nto west Africa and shows a lesser pathogenicity. Viruses that produce tumours in their \\nnatural hosts or in experimental animals, or induce malignant transformation of cells on \\nculture are known as oncogenic viruses. \\nAll retroviruses have an outer envelope consisting of lipid and viral proteins; the \\nenvelope encloses the core, made of other viral proteins, within which lie two molecules \\nof viral RNA and the enzyme reverse transcriptase, an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. \\nThe virions have a diameter of about 100 nm and, in thin section, differences can be seen \\nin the appearance of the core; those with a central condensed structure are known as \\ntype C particles while those with an eccentric bar structure are type D particles. \\n~ ____ gp120 \\n.A\\'eJ~fL. \\n~~\\':ct:Jr:o::Qi~~M--- gp41 \\n\"e:\\'IItft\\'-:lIIr---P 17 \\ni--~!!--- p24 \\n.rf----iH-~~----- RNA \\n\\\\..(\"\"l::::\\'~t\"to.,l-#.\"\".It-- Reverse \\ntranscriptase \\n~tb.,;;,;~~ l1II~-\\'~--- Lipid bilayer \\nFig. 7 : Electron micrograph of HIV \\nResistance \\nHIV is a delicate virus. It is thermolabile being inactivated at 50°C in 10 min and \\nin second at 100°C. It cannot survive outside the living host. However the live virus has \\nbeen reported to survive within blood upto 8 days.

It has been shown that: \\n* virus may survive for upto 15 days at room temperature.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 197 \\n* at 37°C virus can su.rvive for 10-15 days \\n* over 60°C virus is inactivated 100-fold each hour. \\nThese are the limits of survival. However, the results underline the need for \\ncleanliness and disinfection when dealing with blood and infected secretions. \\nClassification \\nThe family Retroviridae was originally divided into the sub families Oncovirinae, \\nSpumavirinae and Lentivirinae, based on their biological properties and appearance in \\ncell cultures. However the availability of nucleotide sequences from a large number of \\nhuman and animal retroviruses has indicated that viruses referred to as oncoviruses \\nbelong to several distinct groups. In the new classification of retroviruses there are five \\ngroups, including two corresponding to the original lentiviruses and spumaviruses, a \\ngroup containing HTLV-1 and II and the BID group that contains a number of oncogenic \\nviruses from other animals. \\nThe human viruses HTLV-1 and HTLV-II are related to the simian viruses STLV-\\n1 and II that are widely distributed in old and New world monkeys . In common with \\nHTLV-I, they can cause lymphomas in some primates. \\nMorphology \\nHIV is a spherical enveloped virus, about 90-120 nm in diameter with a three layer \\nstructure. In the centre are two identical copies of ssRNA (9.2 kb each) associated with \\nreverse transcriptase and surrounded by an icosahedral capsid,. which in turn is \\nsurrounded by a matrix protein followed by a host cell membrane derived lipid bilayer \\nenvelope from which project 72 glycoprotein peplomers. The genome organization is \\nsimilar for all retroviruses in that their genomes contain in the same order the genes gag, \\npol and env, which code for the three groups of structural protein. The long terminal repeat \\nsequences (LTR) at both ends of the genome contain promoter and enhancer sequences. \\nThere are important differences between the types in the nature and arrangement of the \\ngenes involved in the regulation of the replication cycle. The genome of HIV contains three \\nmajor genes each coding for two or more polypeptides. The gag (group specific antigen) \\ngene encodes the core or capsid and matrix proteins, the pol gene encodes the reverse \\ntranscriptase (polymerase) and the env gene encodes the virion envelope peplomer protein \\nand transmembrane protein. HIV-1 is divided into 3 groups. HIV-1M (major group), HIV-\\n10 (outlier) and HIV-IN (new virus). HIV-IM comprises eight sub types or clades, \\ndesignated A,B, C, D, F, C, Hand J as well as four major circulating recombinant forms \\n(AE, AC, ACI, AB) India predominantly has HIV-1M sub type C. Sub types A and Bare \\nless frequent. However western developed countries have HIV-1M sub type B as predominant \\nsub type. Sub type C is usually acquired by heterosexual contact and subtype B by \\nhomosexual contact. HIV-2 has been divided in 5 sub types (A to E). There are at least \\nsix regulatory genes in HIV and at least two in HTLV-1. In HIV, tat codes for a protein \\nthat has a general stimulating effect on the synthesis of all viral proteins through its \\nbinding to a region in the LTR that promotes transcription of viral mRNAs. The rev gene \\nproduct has a regulatory effect, switching on viral protein synthesis by favouring the \\nproduction of full-length RNA molecules rather than the spliced RNA from the regulatory198 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\ngenes. There is evidence that the product of other transactivating genes such as that of \\ncytomegalovirus, can also act on the same sequence within the LTR of HIV. The four \\nproteins coded for by the gag gene of HIV are all found in the virion. The pol gene products \\nare a protease, endonuclease, integrase and reverse transcriptase. The env gene codes for \\na large protein that is glycosylated and cleaved to gp 41, the transmembrane protein and \\ngp 120, the external envelope glycoprotein present on the envelope as a trimer with many \\nglycosylation sites. Both HIV-1 and -2 show considerable sequence variability, which has \\nallowed their classification into a ilumber of sub types that show marked difference in \\ngeographical distribution and association with different risk groups. HIV variants are \\ncurrently classified into at least eight subtypes (A-H) that differ from each other by \\n20-30% in nucleotide sequence. In addition, in areas with more th~n one subtype in \\ncirculation, viruses with recombinant genomes have been described. \\nReplication \\nRetroviruses differ from other RNA viruses in that they replicate and produce viral \\nRNA from a DNA copy of the virion RNA. The best studied method of attachment of \\nHIV to cells is by the interaction of the external envelope glycoprotein gp 120 with part \\nof the CD4 molecule of T helper lymphocytes and other cells. Attachment is followed by \\ninteraction of tlle HIV envelope with a second (co-) receptor. Membrane proteins used by \\nHIV-1 and -2 in this second step include the chemokine receptors, CCR5 and CXCR4. \\nThese are expressed on a wide range of lymphoid and non-Iumphoid cells, whose ligands \\nare chemotactic cytokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein -1 a involved in \\ninflammatory responses. After this second binding step, entry of the virus occurs by fusion \\nof the viral envelope with the cellular membrane, a step that requires exposure of a \\nhydrophobic domain in gp 41. once the RNA is released into the cytoplasm, the reverse \\nL Viral RNA \\nup \\np55 p100 gp160 \\n11\\\\ protea(l~donuclease / \\\\ \\np17 p24 p7.p9 Reverse gp120 gp41 \\ntranscriptase \\nFig. 8 : The genomic organization of HIV structural genes and their protein products \\ntranscriptase acts to form the double-stranded DNA copy, which is circularized, enters \\nthe nucleus and is spliced into the host cell DNA. Once inserted into the host DNA, \\ninfection with HIV is permanent. The virus may stay latent or enter a productive cycle. \\nTranscription of mRNA from the provirus is by the host RNA polymerase to produce viral \\nmRNA and RNA. Proteins are synthesized and processed to form the virion components. \\nVirions are assembled at the cell membrane where envelope and core proteins have located.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 199 \\nThe internal structure of the virion matures as the virion buds from the cell. In the \\nproductive growth cycle the host cell is destroyed. \\nHIV and AIDS \\nIn contrast to HTLV-I, a great deal is known about the association of HIV with \\ndisease. \\nAcute HIV infection: 2-6 weeks after infection most patients develop acute-onset \\nfever with or without night sweats, malaise, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, lethargy, \\ndiarrhoea, depression, sore throat lymphadenopathy, skin rash, mucocutaneous \\nulcerations and sometime meningoencephalopathy. Spontaneous resolution occurs within \\none months. There is temporary fall in CD4+ and CDS+ cells followed by CDS+ \\nlymphocytosis. Test for HIV antibodies are usually negative at the onset of the illness \\nbut become positive during its course. Therefore acute HIV infection is also known as \\nseroconversion illness. \\n(1) The acute seroconversion illness resembles glandular fever, with adenopathy and \\nflu-like symptoms . Although most patients will experience some symptoms, only 5-10% \\nshow the full picture. Even fewer have the rare encephalitic presentation. \\n(2) Asymptomatic infection: All persons inf~cted with HIV, wheather they develop \\nseroconversion illness or not past through a long asymptomatic period of 1-15 yrs (Average \\n10 yrs). They show positive HIV antibody tests during this phase and are infectious. \\nHowever autoimmune conditions like Guillain Barre Syndrome, chronic demyclinating \\nneuropathy, idiopathic thrombo cytopenia, Reiter\\'s Syndrome, polymyositis, Cranial nerve \\npalsy may occur during this period. \\n(3) Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) is present in 25-30% of patients \\nwho are otherwise asymptomatic. The enlarged lymph nodes are painless and symmetrical \\nin distribution. The rate of progression of patients with PGL to AIDS is no greater than \\nin those without adenopathy. \\n(4) The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) presents in many ways, all \\ndue to the underlying severe loss of the ability to respond to infectious agents and to \\ncontrol tumours. The features classified as group IV include what was known as the AIDs\\xad\\nrelated complex or ARC. This label was applied to patients with constitutional symptoms . \\nFollowing features indicate disease progression: \\n(i) Downward trend of CD4+ T cells in successive samples. \\n(ii) The ease of virus culture \\n(iii) The presence of p24 antigen in the plasma. \\n(iii) The loss of antibody to p24 antigen \\nWhen CD4+ T cell count falls below 400/wL, the patient may develop constitutional \\nsymptoms like fever, weight loss and diarrhoea and minor opportunisitic infections. \\nWithout treatment, such patients will progress rapidly to AIDS. The clinical features of \\nAIDS are varied and reflect the specific agents involved: a diagnosis is made if the \\nconditions listed in table are present here.200 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nOral hairy leucoplakia appears to be unique to HIV-infected patients.

Infection is not transmitted \\nby travelling in a bus or a train with an AIDS patient, sharing public telephone, toilets, \\ncooking and eating facilities or by the bite of mosquitoes, bed bugs or other blood sucking \\ninsects. Infection is not transmitted through air, food, water, fomites or by donating \\nblood. \\nUrine, faeces, sweat, milk, bronchialveolar lavage fluid, amniotic fluid and synovial \\nfluid have been reported to yield zero or a few HIV particles. Therefore, these are not \\nimportant in HIV transmission. Saliva in adults contains some nonspecific inhibitory \\nsubstances like fibronectins which can prevent cell to cell transfer of virus. This saliva \\nis not a likely vehicle of transmission of HIV.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 203 \\nReplication of HIV \\nHIV attaches via its gp 120 envelope glycorprotein (surface spike) to the CD4 antigen \\ncomplex which is the primary HIVreceptor on CD4+ (helper/inducer) T lymphocytes and \\ncells of the macrophage lineage. The CD4 molecule has binding avidity for gp 120 of HIV. \\nThen by pinocytosis, the nucleocapsid of the virion enters into host cell. The envelope \\nof the same does not enter into the cell. After entry into the cell, the nucleocapsid releases \\nits RNA into the cytoplasm. The viral reverse transcriptase, acting as an RNA dependent \\nDNA polymerase, makes a DNA copy of the genomic RNA. The ssDNA is made double\\xad\\nstranded by the same enzyme, now acting as a DNA-dependent DNA- polymerase. \\nThis dsDNA moves to the nucleus and several such molecules become integrated \\nas provirus at random sites in the host cell chromosome causing a latent infection. The \\nintegrated provirus is transcribed by cellular RNA polymerase II either for the production \\nof mRNAs which are translated into proteins or for the production of genomic RNA for \\ninsertion into progeny virions. \\nHIV establishes a latent infection with or without an initial productive phase. In \\nthis state, the integrated proviral DNA remains silent without transcription or expression \\nof most viral proteins. Certain factors, however, can activate the virus and convert the \\nlatent state into productive HIV infection. During viral replication, naked virus buds from \\nthe surface qf the infected cell and acquires a lipoprotein envelope which contains lipid \\nderived from the host cell membrane and glycoproteins which are virus-encoded. \\nPathogenesis \\nSince HIV infects cells expressing CD4 antigen, therefore, in the circulation the virus \\nis found in CD4+ T lymphocytes and also in monocyte-macrophage cells, which may act \\nas a reservoir for virus. Macrophage are also important in carrying the virus into the central \\nnervous system across the blood-brain barrier. Virus is also present in the plasma. It is \\nprobably derived from the lysis of activated lymphocytes. Within one month or so, viraemia \\ndeclines to a near undetectable level and illness subsidies. This is brought by CD8+ \\ncytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and antibody-dependent cell-mediated \\ncytotoxicity (ADCC). \\nThis is followed by a long asymptomatic period of 1-15 years (average 10 years). \\nDuring this period, only a small number of circulating CD4+ cells are producing virus \\nand only low titres of virus are present in the blood. However, many infected cells can \\nbe detected in the lymph nodes. Follicular hyperplasia develops in these and other \\nlumphoid organs. When CD4+ T cell count falls below 400/ ilL, a large number of virions \\nspill over from the degenerating lymph nodes into the blood and opportunistic infections \\nwith various microorganisms may develop. Cause of death is the opportunistic infections, \\nmalignancy and cachexia-like state. Fall in CD4+ T cell count is d~e to: \\n1. Viral cytolysis of CD4+ T cells. \\n2. Infected CD4+ T cell can fuse, via. gp 120, with up to 100 uninfected CD4+ \\nT cells forming a unit called syncytium. This will lead to the death of the entire \\nunit.204 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n3. Immune cytolysis of infected T cells by cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, ADCC and \\nantibody/complement-mediated lysis. \\n4. HIV may also infect stem cells, so that there is no replacement. \\n5. AIDS may be a autoimmune disease, causing autoimmune destruction of \\ninfected CD4+ T cells. \\nThe helper cells (CD4+ T cells) provide positive signal to B cells so that they can \\nproduce specific antibody and cytotoxic or suppressor cells (CD4+ T cells) suppress the \\nunwanted production of antibody by B cells. The pathogenic mechanism of HIV may be \\nsummarized as under: \\n1. Diminished positive signal to B cells resulting in poor production of specific \\nantibodies. This ultimately results in dIfferent types of bacterial infections in AIDS cases. \\n2. Diminished signal to cytotoxic or suppressor T cells resulting in defective killing \\nof intracellular virus. This ultimately results in failure to eliminate HIV and other \\nassociated viral infections. \\n3. Diminished signal to NK cells causing impaired defence against tumours. This \\nultimately results in increased prevalence of tumours ego Kaposi\\'s sarcoma. \\n4. Diminished signal to macrophages resulting in impaired killing of organisms \\nwithin macrophages. This ultimately results in infections by organism like Toxoplasma \\ngondii. \\n5. Diminished response to skin reactivity because of the non-availability of helper \\nT cells at the site of injection of antigens resulting in little release of mediators and poor \\nresponse to skin test antigens. \\n6. HIV can also infect: \\n(i) Monocytes \\n(ii) Macrophages leading to opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis and \\ntoxoplasmosis. \\n(iii) Microglia, neurons, capillary endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes \\nin the brain leading to the diverse CNS manifestations of AIDS. \\n(iv) M (membranous) cells and enterochromaffin cells in intestinal mucosa leading \\nto chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption. \\nSince most of the above cells lack CD4 antigen, HIV may be able to utilize alternative \\nreceptor. \\nKaposi\\'s sarcoma was one of the earliest diseases used to define AIDS. This rare \\ntumour had been known for many years; it usually occurred at a single site and was \\nnot aggressive. In AIDS patients the tumour arises in many sites, including the skin, mouth, \\ngut and eye. The tumours arise from endothelial cells of blood vessels, causing bluish\\xad\\npurple, raised irregular lesions. The aetiological agent is thought to be human herpesvirus \\n8. The tumours were seen only in homosexual men, the incidence has now declined. \\nPneumoClJstis carinii pneumonia was another presentation found in many of the first \\npatients recognized. This opportunist pathogen was known to cause infections in theTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 205 \\nimmunocompromised, but the diagnosis in young men with no explanation for their \\nimmunosuppression was the first clue to the recognition of AIDS. \\nToxoplasma gondii infections can manifest at various sites, but are always associated \\nwith compromised patients. The brain is an important site. \\nHIV dementia develops in 25% of patients with AIDS and is marked by a gradual \\nloss of cognition, progressing to overt dementia. Brain scans show a loss of tissue, with \\nwidening of sulci and ventricles. \\nIn developing countries many of the same infections are seen but there is an \\nemphasis on local problems. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections are an enormous problem \\nin many regions, with the development of strains of the organism resistant to many \\nantibiotics. Many patients show profound weight loss, perhaps accompanied by chronic \\ndiarrhoea; the term slim disease has been given to this presentation. \\nPaediatric AIDS cases suffer from many of the problems of adults. However, children \\ninfected early in life or at birth are at risk of recurring bacterial infections as they have \\nnever acquired immunity to the organisms. Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary \\nlymphoid hyperplasia are presentation seen only in young children. \\nPathogenesis of HIV Infection and Aids \\nAIDS is unique sexually transmitted disease without local genital manifestations \\nat any time during infection but with grave systematic manifestation. The first cell to \\nbecome infected may be resident tissue macrophages or sub mucosal lymphocytes\\' in the \\ngenital tract or rectum. The virus is than transported to draining lymph node where it \\nreplicates extensively 2-3 weeks after infection most patients develops viraemia, fall in \\nCD4+ T lymphocytes and glandular fever like illness. The incubation period in the acute \\nstage is from 1 to 2 months. This is preceded by a period of intense, unrestrained viral \\nreplication, reflected in the presence of high numbers of viral RNA genomes and p24 \\nantigen in the circulation. After entering the body, virus is taken up by cells such as \\ndendritic cells that carry the viral receptors. Within 24-48 h infected cells are present in \\nthe regional lymph nodes; virus can be detected in the blood and circulating lymphocytes \\nby 5 days. As the immune system responds, both p 24 antigen and RNA copy number \\ndecrease, so that by 6-12 months p24 antigen is usually undetectable and the RNA load \\nhas stabilized at a lower level; in some it may be undetectable. The decline in RNA copy \\nnumber is usually by at least 3-4 10glO\\' and the effectiveness of the immune system in \\ncontrolling virus replication at this time forecasts when the virus will escape control and \\nsymptoms appear. Temporary increases in the RNA level can be seen dUling intercurrent \\ninfections, immunizations and pregnancy. \\nPatients with AIDS are profoundly immunosuppressed. It was recognized early that \\nthe ratio of T helper to cytotoxic T cells (CD4:CD8) was markedly reduced. In fact, the \\nratio is upset in the acute stages, but is restored as the patient\\'s response controls the \\nvirus. \\nIn peripheral blood, lymphoid tissue and other tissues such as brain where HIV \\nreplication occurs, HIV targets, CD4 positive (CD4+) cells and cells of the206 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nmonocytemacrophage lineage; the latter may act as an important reservoir of virus. \\nMacrophages are also important in carrying the virus into the central nervous system \\nacross the blood-brain barrier. \\nThe proportion of infected CD4+ cells and the level of circulating virus rise as the \\ninfection progresses, reflecting increasing virus replication until the patient becomes \\nsymptomatic. Activation of latently infected lymphocytes can be achieved by contact with \\nforeign antigen and lectins such as phytohaemagglutinin. Activation of uninfected CD4+ \\ncells is also important in increasing their sensitivity to infection. \\nDestruction of CD4+ cells is caused by: \\n• viral replication \\n• syncytium formation via membrane gp 120 binding to cell CD4 antigen \\n• cytotoxic T cell lysis of infected cells \\n• cytotoxic T cell lysis of CD4+ cells carrying gp 120 released from infected cells. \\n• natural killer cells \\n• antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity \\nSero\\xad\\nconversion \\nMonths \\np24 antigenaemia \\nAsymptomatic AIDS \\nor PGL \\nTime \\n345678 \\nYears \\nFig. 10 : Events in HIV infection \\nAnalysis of the viral genomes from a patient shows that there are several different \\nviral genomes present at any time and that these change with time. virus isolated in culture \\nmay be different from the predominant variants in the blood.

Regions of the \\nenvelope glycoproteins show most variation and this could affect the ability of antibody \\nto react with the viruses.

The RNA counts are often \\nmore than 100 OOO/mi at 2 months. About three-quarters will show a steady decline \\nthereafter of 0.610g10 each year; however, by age 9-16 years, a third are still asymptomatic \\nand show little impairment of immune function.

The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA is 99.7% and 95% or \\nmore respectively. If one ELISA and western blot is used then accuracy is 99.99%. \\nTests for anti-HIV \\nThis was the first practical approach and many different assays are now available, \\nmost using enzyme tracing of the reaction (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ELISA). \\nAll current tests use HIV antigens derived from cloned recombinant HIV gag, pol and \\nenv genes expressed in Escherichia coli, or synthetic peptides. Western or immunoblotting \\nhas been used extensively as a confirmatory assay. Most current assay can detect antibody \\nto both HIV-l and HIV-2 antigens. A first positive result must be confirmed by at least \\ntwo other different assays with different viral antigens, and a second serum sample \\nchecked to confirm that the original sample was correctly identified. \\nAs all who are infected with HIV remain so, a positive tests for anti-HIV indicates \\nthat the patient is infected. Most patients will seroconvert within 2-3 months but some \\nmay take longer. Thus there is a window before antibody tests can detect infection. \\npeR \\nBoth HIV RNA and DNA sequences can be detected by PCR. RNA sequences are \\nfound in extracellular virus particles in plasma. Levels of RNA can be assayed as copy \\nnumber and indicate the extent of virus replication in the patient. Measurement of plasma \\nvirus load is now essential for monitoring disease progression and response to antiviral \\ntherapy. A number of commercial assays have been developed. e.g the Roche monitor™ \\nand Bayer Nuclisens™ assays, to provide accurate and standardized viral load \\nmeasurements in clinical laboratories. \\nHIV proviral DNA is synthesized in infected cells, and can be detected readily in \\nperipheral blood mononuclear cells of infected individuals. This method is principally \\nused to diagnose infection in infants born to HIV-infected mothers. As infection is often \\nacquired perinatally, a negative test result at 3 months or later is required to exclude \\ninfection. In horizontally transmitted infections, detection of proviral DNA can be usedTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 209 \\nto diagnose an acute infection before seroconversion, although detection of plasma viral \\nRNA is more often used. \\nTests for p24 antigen \\nP24 antigen is part of the virion core and it can be found in the blood when there \\nis active viral replication. Antigenaemia is usually of short duration at the time of initial \\ninfection, and may not be detected in all cases. As the antibody response builds up antigen \\ntests become negative. However, late in infection, p24 antigen may reappear until most \\npatients give a positive result. Tests for p24 antigen are now used less often since the \\nintroduction of PCR assays for viral RNA load estimation for monitoring disease \\nprogression. Similarly, p24 antigen detection is rarely used for the diagnosis of acute \\ninfection before seroconversion for antibody, or detecting infection in neonates. \\nImmunofluorescence test \\nIn this test HIV infected cells are acetone fixed on to glass slides and then reacted \\nwith test serum followed by fluorescein conjugated anti human gammaglobulin. A positive \\nreaction appears as apple green fluorescence of cell membrane under fluorescence \\nmicroscope. \\nVirus isolation \\nIsolation of HIV is slow, taking from 3 to 6 weeks. The usual sample is blood, from \\nwhich the lymphocytes are separated and co-cultured with phytohaemagglutinin-stimualted \\ndonor lymphocytes. Virus presence is detected by assays for reverse transcriptase and p24 \\nantigen in the culture fluids. With the advent of PCR, there are now few, if any, diagnostic \\nuses of virus isolation. \\nHTLV-l \\nAssays for the detection of antibody to HTLV-I are available; as with HIV, \\nconfirmation by other assays or immunoblot must be attempted, although interpretation \\ncan be difficult. Confirmatory tests are able to distinguish between HTLV-I and HTLV\\xad\\nII. Detection of HTL V proviral sequences by PCR can also be used as a confirmatory test, \\nand to distinguish HTLV-I and HTLV-II. \\nTreatment \\nHTL V -1 Infection \\nInterferon and inhibitors of reverse transcriptase may have a role, but further \\nevaluation is needed. \\nHIV infection and AIDS \\nSpecific therapy for HIV infection has been available for some years since the \\ninhibitory effect of zidovudine on the viral reverse transcriptase (reverse transcriptase \\ninhibitor, RTI) was discovered. It was established that zidovudine therapy could lead to210 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nan improvement in the patient\\'s health, with weight gain, a reduction in viral load and \\npartial recovery of CD4+ cell numbers. However, the improvement seldom lasted longer \\nthan 6 months, as drug-resistant mutants were selected. A similar response is seen with \\nother RTIs used along. More recently, a second point of attack against HIV has been \\nexploited with the development of drugs active against the viral protease. \\nThe major advance has come with the application of combination therapy, where \\nRTIs are given with protease inhibitor. At present, the compounds available are: \\n• nucleoside analogue RTIs: zidovudine; didanosine (ddI); abacavir; zalcitabine \\n(ddC); stavudine; lamivudine \\n• non-nucleoside RTIs: nevirapine; delavirdine; efavirenz \\n• protease inhibitors; indinavir; ritonavir; nelfinavir; saquinavir; amprenavir. \\nInitial therapy is now a combination of two RTIs and a protease inhibitor. A typical \\ncombination is: \\n• zidovudine 200 mg three times a day \\n• lamivudine 150 mg twice a day \\n• indinavir 800 mg three times a day or nelfainavir 750 mg three times a day. \\nIt is essential that the drugs are started together and that the regime is adhered \\nto strictly. It is important to know if the drugs have been used before by that patient and \\nif the patient is infected with drug-resistant virus. Each drug should be given at its \\noptimum dosage and schedule. If a drug is to be replaced because of prior use, known \\nresistance or development of resistance, an alternative should be chosen that does not \\nshow cross-resistance with the drug being replaced. \\nIt is important to continue with the prophylaxis and prompt treatment of opportunistic \\ninfections such as Pneumocystis carinii and Toxoplasma gondii. Some patients have problems \\nwith compliance to the drug regime and some suffer significant side-effects. About 50% \\nof those on long-term therapy will suffer a redistributon of body fat the lipodystrophy \\nsyndrome. Many patients have been treated for years with a good quality of life as a result \\nof these advances. The major problems is the emergence of resistance. \\nTransmission and Epidemiology \\nHTLV-l and HTLV-II \\nThe three lineages of HTLV-I strains are linked to Melanesia, to central Africa and \\nto various countries, the cosmopolitan group. The latter includes viruses from Japan, North \\nand West Africa and the Caribbean, which can be distinguished. HTLV-I and the simian \\nvirus, STLV-I are closely related and it is proposed that human infection occurred many \\nthousands of years ago in Africa and that the presence of the virus in many different \\nparts of the world is related to the migration of ancient peoples. The slave trade may \\naccount for foci found in the West Indies and the southern USA. \\nWhere it is found the virus is endemic in certain communities. In parts of Japan, \\nthe prevalence of antibody can be 27%, with a rising trend from 7 to 8% in the 20-39 \\nyears age group to 52% in females and 32% in males by 80 years. In the Caribbean, theTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 211 \\nrates are in the range of 5-10% with clusters in communities and families. In other regions, \\ninfection has been found in parenteral drug misusers and prostitutes. \\nThe virus is cell-associated in the host, so transmission will occur when infected \\ncells are transferred. This can occur during intercourse. Breast milk is also a source. \\nTransfer of infected lymphocytes during blood transfusion and sharing injecting equipment \\nby drug misusers are other recognized routes. \\nHTLV-II is transmitted by the same routes. The strains found in drug misusers in \\ndifferent countries are related. \\nTransmission of HIV-l and HIV-2 \\nThe World Health Organization estimates that worldwide more than 40 million \\npeople have been infected with HIV and that 16 million have died. \\nVirus is present in the blood, semen, and cervical and vaginal secretions, and these \\nsources are important in transmission. Virus may also be present in cerebrospinal fluid \\n(CSF), saliva, tears and urine, but at lower titres than in blood. There is no epidemiological \\nevidence that these are significant sources for transmission. Free virus is present at high \\ntitre during the early stage of infection and increases in titre in the blood in the later \\nstages of the disease; there is evidence of a greater risk of transmission from such \\npatients. \\nTo transmit, virus has to reach susceptible cells at the point of entry, e.g. Langerhan\\'s \\ncells in mucous membranes, or after entering the circulation. \\nt \\nThe three important routes of transmission of HIV are: \\n- by unprotected, penetrative sexual intercourse \\n- from mother to child \\n- by blood and blood products. \\nSexual Intercourse \\nHeterosexual transfer of virus is the route by which the great majority of infections \\nare spread, accounting for 90% of the global total: most live in the developing world. \\nBoth sexes are affected equally. Overall the estimated risk of transmission from one \\nunprotected exposure is 0.1-0.2% for vaginal intercourse. The probability of transfer is \\nincreased if either partner has ulcerative genital or other sexually transmitted disease. \\nAny trauma during intercourse will also facilitate transfer, by allowing direct access \\nof the virus to susceptible cells and the circulation. Sex workers are at high risk due \\nto their large number of partners; they are often an important reservoir. Transmission \\nmay be more likely from male to female. \\nAIDS was first recognized in homosexual men in the USA. Most early studies \\nestablished that unprotected anal intercourse was a particular risk, especially to the \\npassive, receptive partner. The estimated risk from a single exposure is 0.1-0.3%. \\nTransmission during oral sexual contact has been documented, but is not a major \\nroute.212 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMother to Child \\nMost perinatal transmission occurs late in pregnancy or during birth. The most likely \\nsource is cells and virus in the cervis and vagina, as the baby passes through the birth \\ncanal. The risk of transmission varies from 13 to 32% in the developed world to 25-48 % \\nin the developing world. Prolonged and difficult labour is a factor. Breast milk is another \\npossible source. It is difficult to be precise about the contribution of this route, but estimates \\nranging from 14-30% have been made. \\nBlood and Blood Products \\nAll blood for transfusion and the preparation of products such as factor VIII for \\nhaemophiliacs is screened for anti-HIV by sensitive assays. This eliminates almost all the \\nrisk, but as there is a delay of some weeks before the tests become positive, it is important \\nto screen donors for possible exposure to risk. Preparation of blood products from large \\npools of donations was a major factor in contaminating the product as even one infected \\ndonation could introduce virus to all the material. Transplanted organs have been \\nimplicated in a few cases. \\nIntravenous drug misuse is a risk factor in about one-quarter of AIDS cases in the \\nUSA and to a varying extent elsewhere in the world. The risk rises with the volume of \\nblood injected and the frequency of sharing contaminated equipment. The withdrawal of \\nblood before injection increases contamination. The virus can spread very rapidly so that \\nmost p1isusers in an area become infected in a few months. Those infected in this way \\ncan spread the virus to their sexual partners. Drug and sexual routes merge when misusers \\nsupport their habit by prostitution. \\nOccupational exposure of health care workers to infected patients has resulted in \\ntransmission in a relatively small number of cases. The route is via accidental penetrating \\ninjuries with needles and sharps contaminated with blood. The risk from a needle stick \\nis 1 in 200-300; up to 1998, less than 200 instances had been established or suspected \\nin North America and Europe. Contamination of eyes and mucous membranes is another \\npossible route, but this is seldom confirmed. Transmission from health care workers to \\npatient has been suspected in only a few cases. \\nHIV-2 is transmitted by the same routes as HIV-1 . . \\nThe majority of infected individuals have a recognized exposure to a known source \\nof infection. In some this may be difficult to establish. However, there is no evidence that \\nHIV can spread by casual contact and by inhalation. \\nStudies of people exposed to the virus on many occasions have shown that a few \\nshow no evidence of infection, and remain negative for anti-HIV. The resistance of these \\nindividuals is of great interest to understanding protective immunity. \\nEpidemiology of HIV \\nThe extent of spread of infection can be measured by the numbers of cases identified \\nclinically and by serological testing. Much more evidence can be obtained from \\nseroprevalence surveys of particular groups or the general population. The availabilityTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 213 \\nand collection of samples impose limits. Surveys have been performed on patients \\nattending hospitals antenatal clinics, sexually transmitted disease clinics and blood \\ndonors. Specific groups such as drug misusers and prostitutes can be targeted, non\\xad\\ninvasive sampling, e.g. collecting saliva, may make these studies more feasible. Repeat \\ntesting over time will give an indication of the trend of infection in that population. Such \\nstudies are important in monitoring the effect of intervention strategies and forecasting \\nthe demand for health services. \\nHIV was isolated in the early 1980s but the first identified cases date to the 1960s. \\nDuring the 1970s, the virus began to spread widely in some populations and groups by \\nthe routes described above. \\nIn North and South America, Europe and Australia, at least-30-40% of cases are \\nin gay men. Parenteral drug misusers are the other major risk group in these areas. Virus \\nof sub type B is closely associated with these groups and accounts for at least 50% of \\nall infections. The other cases are in the heterosexual partners of bisexual men, drug \\nmisusers and men and women from other areas of the world. Infected blood caused some \\ncases before screening was introduced. The estimated prevalence in the population is from \\n0.05 to 0.35%. with less than 0.01 % in antenatal patitmts. The numbers of infections in \\nrisk groups can change as health education programmes are introduced; however, their \\nsuccess can vary and advice may be ignored if the perception of risk changes. There have \\nbeen 1.4 million deaths so far in these areas. \\nRegions of Africa have suffered the greatest epidemic spread of the virus, particularly \\nin most of the countries of the sub-saharan region. It is estimated that 60% of the world \\ntotal of infections are in this area. Population prevalences range from 1.5 to 18%, with \\n2-40% of atenatal patients infected. The viruses circulating here are of sub types C, A,D \\nand E. Of these, C has spread rapidly and now accounts for 50% of an infections. There \\nis some evidence that subtype C may be able to transmit more easily by heterosexual \\ncontact that subtype B, due to its greater affinity for the receptors of Langerhan\\'s cells. \\nAlmost 90% of AIDS deaths have occurred in Africa (13.7 million). The virus \\ncontinues to spread, and there were an estimated 3.8 million new infections in 1999. The \\nsocial and economic consequences of this epidemic are devastating, with the loss of \\nparents and wage earners. The high infant mortality will have profound effects in the \\nfuture. \\nHIV was introduced into South and South-east Asia later than in the rest of the \\nworld, and so far there have been 1.2 million deaths from AIDS. Infection is spreading \\nrapidly, with an estimated 1.3 million new infections in 1999. The earliest infections were \\nin drug misusers, but this did not lead to wide spread outside the risk group. The situation \\nchanged with the introduction of sub type C virus, and there is now rapid heterosexual \\ntransmission of this strain. Prevalences from 0.45 to 3.5% have been effective, with 1-10% \\nin antenatal patients, without effective intervention large numbers of cases and deaths \\nwill occur, with all the expected human and socio-economic consequences. Throughout \\nthe region, sub types A, B, C, D and E have been found. \\nAs a result of the wide circulation of different sub types in some populations, \\nrecombinant viruses have been identified. AC and AD recombinants have been found.214 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nStudies in Tanzania suggest that 15% of the virus population in the country is recombinant \\nand that these viruses can be transmitted. A few recombinants have been isolated from \\nareas in the East. \\nThe existence of different sub types of HIV, and recombinants, is important for two \\nreasons. Firstly, assays for anti-HIV and viral nucleic acid must be able to recognize all \\ntypes. Secondly, vaccine developers must take account of the various types and establish \\nthe spectrum of protection of candidate vaccines. \\nCONTROL \\nSexual Transmission \\nUntil a vaccine is available, the emphasis in controlling the spread of infection must \\nbe on risk reduction by avoiding unprotected penetrative intercourse with partners of \\nunknown status. Despite knowledge of the major routes of infection, there has only been \\nlimited success in reducing sexual transmission. Globally the problem is enormous and \\nefforts are hampered by the poverty and lack of resources of the countries worst affected. \\nThe use of condoms and vaginal antiseptics could have an impact, but they need to be \\navailable and acceptable to the local population. \\nIn the areas of the world with low levels of infection early efforts to encourage safe \\npractices had an effect on the spread of the virus among gay men in the Americas and \\nEurope, but this was not always maintained as the perception of the risks changed as \\na result of declining rates of infection and, more recently, as the latest therapies appeared \\nto be succeeding and prolonging survival. Also, it is difficult to persuade the heterosexual \\nmajority that safe practices are relevant to them. \\nMother to Child Transmission \\nThis can be reduced by identifying infected mothers & giving specific therapy in \\nthe later stages of pregnancy and to the baby after birth. It has been shown that zidovudine \\nalone can reduce the transmission rate by a factor of three if given: \\n• Orally to the mother from weeks 14 to 34 of the pregnancy. \\n• Intravenously to the mother during labour pain. \\n• Orally to the child for 6 weeks after delivery. \\nIf the mother is already being treated, zidovudine should be part of her treatment, \\neven if she has had it before, transplacental transfer of the drug is important, perhaps \\naided by phosphorylation of the drug in the placenta. Most transmissions are believed \\nto occur close to, or during, delivery. Thus simpler treatment regimes may be effective. \\nOral therapy for the mother for 1 month during delivery and for a short period post-partum \\nmay halve the rate. Further studies are needed to establish the most appropriate regimes \\nfor the developing world. \\nAs exposure to infected genital secretions is the source of the virus, avoiding \\nprolonged rupture of the membranes before delivery can reduce risk. Caesarean section \\nmay have a similar effect, but is of limited applicability.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 215 \\nBreast-feeding is another possible route. However, studies of children protected by \\nspecific therapy at and after birth do not show that there is a significant extra risk of \\ninfection by this route. Even without therapy, the advantages of breast-feeding if no other \\nadequate nutrition is available far outweigh any risk of infection where alternative \\nnutrition is available, the baby may not be breast-fed. \\nExposure to Blood \\nDrug injectors can avoid risk by not injecting, or can reduce risk by using only clean \\nequipment. Screening of all blood donors should eliminate almost all possibility of \\ntransmission. Factor VIII and other blood products are heat-treated, if possible, to inactivate \\nHIV. All organ donors must be screened. \\nOccupational risk in the health care setting can be controlled by the implementation \\nof safe working practices to prevent accidental injury and contamination with blood and \\nbody fluids. The use of gloves, masks and eye protection is important in situations such \\nas surgical procedures where bleeding and spattering are possible. The risk must be \\nassessed in other situations. Safe disposal of used needles, scalpel blades and other sharps \\nis an essential requirement. The sensitivity of HIV to heat and various disinfectants has \\nbeen described above. \\nIf an accidental exposure occurs, any wound should be washed with soap and \\nwater, or mucous membranes flushed with water. The accident must be reported so that, \\nif necessary, prophylaxis can be started as soon as possible. The risk must be assessed \\nthrough knowledge of: \\n• The HIV status of the source patient; if unknown, can the source be tested? \\n• Is the source on therapy for HIV? Any evidence of ~rug resistance? \\n• The nature of the exposure, e.g. injury or contamination of skin or mucous \\nmembranes. \\nKnowledge of the status of the source patient is essential. The patient may be known \\nto be antibody-positive or to have AIDS. If on therapy, it is important to know the regimen, \\nand if there is any evidence of drug resistance. The risk of infection from splashing on \\nto mucous membranes or skin is harder to quantify, but is certainly less than with \\npenetrating injuries. An intact skin is an effective barrier, but abrasions and diseases such \\nas eczema may impair this protection. \\nIf a sharp injury is reported the nature of the injury has to be assessed: \\n• needlestick or cut with sharp instrument \\n• depth of penetration \\n• volume of blood involved \\n• if blood vessel entered \\nIf there is an indication of risk, therapy must be started within 1-2 h, and not later \\nthan 48-72 h. If no professional advice is available, e.g. at night, prophylaxis should be \\nstarted and advice obtained and a decision made about continuing with the drugs within216 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n12-24 h. The victim should be involved in the decision, with discussion of the risks and \\nthe possible side-effects of the drugs. \\nZidovudine alone can reduce the transmission rate, but should now be combined \\nwith another RTI (e.g lamivudine) and a protease inhibitor. The combination of drugs \\ncan be varied with knowledge of any drug resistance in the source. Therapy should be \\ncontinued for 4 weeks and the victim followed with testing for virus for the next 6 months. \\nA few cases of transmission have been seen in cases prophylaxis. \\nTABLE 9 \\nCurrently Available Antiretroviral Agents \\nNucleoside reverse \\ntranscriptase inbibitors \\n(NRTIs) \\nNon nucleoside reverse Protease inhibitors \\ntranscriptase inhibitors (PIs) \\nZidovudine (azidothymidine) \\nLamivudine \\n(deoxythiacytidine, 3TC) \\n(NNRTIs) \\nNevirapine \\nDelavirdine \\nStavudine Loviride \\n(didehydrodeoxythymidine, d4T) \\nDidanosine (dideoxyinosine, ddI) Efavirenz \\nZalcitabine (dideoxycytidine, ddC) \\nAmprenavir \\nAbacavir \\nExposure Code \\nRitonavir \\nSaquinavir \\nIndinavir \\nNelfinavir \\nTipranavir \\nIntegrase \\ninhibitor \\nZintevir \\nExposure to blood, body fluid, other potentially infectious material, or an instrument \\ncontaminated with one of these substances \\nEC2 \\nNo PEP required - No - Yes \\nType of Exposure \\nIntact skin \\nVolume \\nMucous membrane or skin integrity compromised \\nPercutaneous exposure \\nSmall e.g. few drops or short duration - ECl \\nLarge e.g. several drops, major splash or longer duration (several minutes or more)-\\nLess severe e.g. solid needle, superficial scratch - EC2 \\nMore severe e.g. large hollow needle, deep puncture, visible blood on device or needle \\nused in patient\\'s artery or vein - EC3THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 217 \\nVaccines \\nMuch effort has been devoted to the development of a vaccine to provide protection \\nagainst infection.

Several prototypes are undergoing evaluation. \\nPOXVIRIDAE \\n(1) Introduction \\nThe family Poxviridae contains two subfamilies, Chordopoxvirinae and \\nEntomopoxvirinae which contain poxviruses of vertebrates and irlsects respectively. \\nChorodopoxvirinae contains eight genera four of which, Orthopoxvirus, Parapoxvirus, \\nMolluscipoxvirus and Yatapoxvirus, cause diseases in humans (Table) Pox viruses are \\nlargest virus that infect vertebrates and can be seen by light microscope. \\nTABLE 10 \\nPoxviruses producing disease in man \\nGenus \\nOrthopoxvirus \\nParapoxvirus \\nMolluscipoxvirus \\nYatapoxvirus \\n2. Clinical features/Symptoms \\nDisease \\n- Small pox \\n- Vaccinia \\n- Buffalo pox \\n- Monkey pox \\n- Cow pox \\n- Milker\\'s node \\n- Orf \\n- Molluscum contagiosum \\n- Yabapox \\n- Tanapox \\nThe small pox virus had no animal reservoir and spread from person to person \\nby the respiratory route. After infecting mucosal cells in upper respiratory tract without \\nproducing symptoms it spread to the regional lymph node and after a transient viraemia, \\ninfected cells throughout the body. Multiplic,!tion of virus in these cells led to a second \\nand more intense viraemia which heralded the onset of clinical illness. During first few \\ndays of fever the virus multipled in skin epithelial cells, leading to the development of \\nfocal lesions and characteristic rash. Macules progressed to papules, vesicles and pustules \\nleaving permanent pockmarks particularly on the face. Two kinds of small pox were \\ncommon in the first half of the 20th century. These were called:218 \\n(A) Variola major/classical small pox \\n(B) Variola minor/Alastrim \\nTEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nVariola major had case fatality rates varying from 10-50% in the unvaccinated \\nvariola minor caused a much milder disease and had case fatility rates of less than 1 %. \\nThe viruses are very similar but can be distinguished in the laboratory by restriction \\nenzyme fragment length polymorphisms of their genome. The last natural case of variola \\nmajor detected was Saiban Bibi, a Bangladeshi woman found with small pox on karimganj \\nrailway platform in Assam on 24th May 1975. The last case of variola minor occurred \\nin Merca, Somalia in October 1977. The incubation period is around 12 days. \\n3. Morphology \\nPoxviruses are the largest animal viruses. They are large enough to be seen by light \\nmicroscopy after special staining procedures. In most genera, the virions are brick-shaped \\nwith rounded corners, measuring 250 x 200 x 200 nm in size. They are known as complex \\nviruses. Pox viruses have a biconcave dumb-bell-shaped DNA core and two lateral bodies \\nenclosed in a protein shell about 12 nm thick. It is known as outer membrane, surface \\nof which consists of irregularly arranged tubules. Virions released from the cells are \\nenclosed within an envelope which consists of host cell lipids and several virus-specified \\npolypeptides, including the haemagglutinin. Their DNA genome range in mass from 85 \\nM Da (parapoxvirus) to 185 M Da (avipoxviruses). The vaccinia virus genome has 186.000 \\nbase pairs (123 MDa). The pox virus genome is distinct in that covalent links join the \\ntwo DNA strands at both ends of the molecule, the genome thus being a single \\nuninterrupted molecule that is folded to form a linear duplex structure. The characteristic \\nfeatures is, identical sequences being present at each end of the genome. \\n4. Physical and Chemical Properties \\nPox virus are stable and if protected from sunlight may remain viable for months \\nat room temperature. In the cold or when freeze dried, they survive for years. They are \\nsusceptible to UV light and other irradiations. They are resistant to 50% glycerol and 1 % \\nphenol but readily inactivated by formation or oxidizing disinfectants. The virion contains \\na multiplicity of enzymes and entire multiplication of virus takes place in the cytoplasm \\nof infected cell. All pox virus share a common nucleoprotein antigen. \\n5. CONTROL OF SMALL POX \\nBefore Vaccination \\nBefore the introduction of vaccination, the control of small pox relied on two \\napproaches, variolation and isolation. Variolators aimed to induce immunity equivalent \\nto that after natural infection. Susceptible individuals were deliberately infected with \\nsmallpox pus or scabs by scratching the skin or by nasal insufflation. Although the virus \\nwas not attenuated, infections had lower case fatality rates and were less likely to cause \\npermanent pock marks than those acquired naturally. Variolation was first recorded in \\nChina nearly 1000 years ago, and was practiced in many parts of the world. VariolatorsTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 219 \\nwere active until very recent times. In Afghanistan, Pakistan and Ethiopia their activities \\ncaused problems towards the end of the small-pox eradication programme in the 1970s \\nbecause they spread virus in a way that evaded the measures erected to control natural \\nvirus transmission. \\nVaccination \\nEdward Jenner vaccinated James Phipps with cowpox virus on 14 May 1796 and \\nchallenged him by variolation some months later. He repeated this \\'trial\\', as he called \\nit, in other children, and the description of these events in his \\'Inquiry\\' in 1798 led to \\nthe rapid world wide acceptance of vaccination. Introduction of the vaccine virus into \\nthe epidermis led to the development of a local lesion and the induction of a strong \\nimmunity to infection with small pox virus that lasted for several years. Although the \\nessentials of Jennerian vaccination remained unchanged for the rest of its history, early \\nvaccinators developed their own vaccine viruses, which became known as vaccinia. The \\norigin of these viruses is obscure, and modern vaccinia viruses form a distinct species \\nof orthopoxvirus, related to but very clearly distinct from the viruses of both cowpox and \\nsmallpox. \\nSmall pox was brought under control by: \\n1. routine vaccination of children-compulsory in some countries \\n2. Odtbreak control by isolation and selective vaccination \\nThis was achieved gradually in Europe, the former USSR, North and Central \\nAmerica, and Japan, and the virus had been eradicated from all these areas by the mid-\\n1950s. In 1959 this achievement prompted the world health organization (WHO) to adopt \\nthe global eradication of smallpox as a major goal. At this time 60% of the world\\'s \\npopulation lived in areas where small pox was endemic. A slow reduction in disease \\nwas maintained for the next few years, but epidemics continued to be frequent. \\nConsequently the WHO initiated its intensified small pox eradication programme. This \\nstarted on 1st January 1967 when the disease was reported in 31 countries. It had the \\ngoal of eradication within 10 years. The goal was achieved in 10 years, 9 months and \\n26 days. From a starting point of 10 million to 15 million cases annually and against \\na background of civil strife, famine and floods, success came because of a major \\ninternational collaborative effort-aided by some virus-specific factors. At the beginning \\nof 1976 small pox occurred only in Ethiopia. Transmission was interrupted there in \\nAugust of that year, although an importation of virus into Somalia and adjacent \\ncountries had occurred by then. This was the last outbreak. The last case occurred on \\n26 October 1977. In the final years of the programme its emphasis moved from mass \\nvaccination to a strategy of surveillance and containment. This strategy rapidly interrupted \\ntransmission because: \\n.

Cows \\npox lesions are seen on the udder and teats of cows and may be transmitted to humans \\nduring milking. The lesions in humans usually appear on the hands or fingers and \\nresemble primary vaccinia. The disease is associated with some fever and constitutional \\nsymptoms. Cowpox virus resembles variola and vaccinia antigenically but can be \\ndifferentiated by the hemorrhagic lesions it produces on CAM and rabbit skin. \\nCowpox infection has been observed only in Britain and Europe. There have been \\noutbreaks of fatal cowpox infection in wild animals kept in zoos, including cheetahs and \\nelephants. Natural infection has been observed in domestic cats. It has been suggested \\nthat the primary host of cowpox may not be cows but more likely wild rodents or cats. \\nMilker\\'s node (paravaccinia) is a trivial occupational disease that humans get by \\nmilking infected cows.

It \\nresembles the orf virus morphologically. \\nOrf (contagious pustular dermatitis): Orf is a disease of sheep and goats transmitted \\nto human beings by contact. In humans, the disease occurs as a single papulovesicular \\nlesion with a central ulcer, usually on the hand, forearm or face. The virus is unrelated \\nto the variola-vaccinia group and resembles paravaccinia virus morphologically. \\nTanapox: This virus was isolated from epidemics of a febrile illness along the Tana \\nriver in Kenya in 1957. The patients had a single pock-like lesion on the upper part of \\nthe body. The virus is antigenically unrelated to other pox viruses and does not grow \\nin eggs. It can be grows in human and monkey tissue cultures. Monkeys are the only \\nanimals susceptible. The virus is now active in Africa, particularly in Zaire. A similar \\nvirus has been isolated from outbreaks of disese in primate colonies in America. \\nMolluscum contagiosum: This disease, seen usually in children and young adults, \\nis characterized by pink or pearly white wart-like nodules on the skin. Sections of the \\nlesions show large (20-30 Jim) eosinophilic hyaline inclusion bodies which displace the \\nnuclei to the margin. These molluscum bodies are composed of large number of virus \\nparticles, embedded in a protein matrix. Humans are the only susceptible hosts. The virus \\ncannot be grown in eggs, tissue cultures or animals. \\nThe incidence of molluscum contagiosum as a sexually transmitted disease in young \\nadults is increasing. When it occurs in the genital area, it may become inflamed and \\nulcerated and may stimulate HSV infections. \\nHERPESVIRUS \\nIntroduction \\nThe herpesvirus family contains over a hundred sps of enveloped DNA viruses that \\naffect humans and animals. Family Herpesviridae has been divided into three sub families. \\nThe virions of this family have the capacity to establish life long latent infections from \\nwhich virus may be reactivated. They are frequently reactivated in AIDS and following \\nimmunosuppressive therapy for organ transplantation or in cancer.222 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMorphology \\nHerpesviruses are 120-200 nm in diameter. They comprise of four distinct structural \\nelements: envelope, tegument, capsid and core. Envelope is the outermost, it is composed \\nof lipid with numerous small glycoprotein peplomers. Tegument is the electron-dense \\nmaterial present between envelope and capsid. It contains several proteins. Inner to the \\ntegument is icosahedral capsid of 100 nm diameter. It has a total of 162 capsomers. Core, \\ninside the capsid, consists of double-stranded, 124-235 kb DNA. With the exception of \\nEpstein-Barr virus, members of the family Herpesviridae can be cultivated in cell cultures \\nand produce giant cells and intranuclear inclusion bodies in infected cells. The envelope \\ncarries surface spikes, about 8 nm long. Between the envelope and the capsid is an \\namorphous structure called the tegument, containing several proteins. \\n-Envelope \\nTegument \\n.JI\\'!~~i.. ... ~::a- Capsid \\nFig. 11 Herpesvirus \\nHerpesvirus replicate in the host cell nucleus.

There are two \\ntypes of herpes simplex virus: type 1 virus (HSV-l) and type 2 virus (H~V-2). HSV-l infects \\nprimarily the mouth, the eye and the central nervous system (regions of the body above \\nthe waist), but it is also responsible for a proportion of cases of genital herpes. HSV-2 \\ninfects genital and anal regions. \\nPathogenesis \\nThe infections caused by herpes simplex viruses can be divided into primary \\ninfection, latent infection, reactivation and recrudescence. Herpes simplex is one of the \\nmost common viral infections in humans about 60-90% of adults showing detectable \\nantibody. Primary infection is usually acquired in early childhood (between 2- 5 yrs of \\nage) humans are the only natural hosts and the source of infection are saliva, skin lesion \\nor respiratory secretions. Asymptomatic carriers form the more important source of \\ninfection especially in genital infection with type 2 strains. Transmission occurs by close \\ncontact and may be veneral in genitial herpes. The virus enters through defects in the \\nskin or mucous membranes and multiply locally, with cell to cell spread. The virus enters224 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\ncutaneous nerve fibres and is transported intraxonically to the ganglia where it replicates. \\nHerpes virus diseases are more frequent and severe in the HIV infected and other \\nimmunodeficient subjects. \\nPrimary infections \\nHSV is transmitted only by contact. The portal of entry in primary infection is the \\ndamaged skin or mucosa and the classic lesion is a vesicle beneath the keratinized squamous \\nepithelial cells. The infection of epithelial cells is cytolytic, the cells lose adhesion, \\noccasionally become multinucleate as a result of virus-induced cell fusion and contain \\neosinophilic intranuclear inclusions. The vesicle and surrounding tissue contain a dense \\ninfiltrate of inflammatory cells, mostly mononuclear. The vesicle drains and the lesion crusts \\nbefore healing occurs, sometimes with residual scarring, and draining lymph nodes are \\ncommonly enlarged during this process. Recurrent lesions are morphologically and \\nhistolOgically similar but are usually less extensive, and lymph node swelling is inapparent. \\nHSV-1 Causes: \\n1. Acute gingivostaomatitis \\n2. Herpetic whitlow \\n3. Keratoconjunctivitis \\n4. Eczema herpeticum \\n5. Encephalitis, and \\n6. Generalized infection \\n1. Acute gingivostaomatitis \\nIt is the most common primary lesion. It leads to acute and painful ulcers, coated \\nwith a greyish slough, inside the mouth on the buccal mucosa and on the gums. The \\nlesions may also involve the tonsils, pharynx or nose. Normally, the disease is self-limiting \\nand lesions disappear in 2-3 weeks. \\n2. Herpetic whitlow \\nIt is an occupational hazard of doctors and nurses, who acquire infection by \\nimplantation of virus from saliva and respiratory secretions of patients. The lesion is \\nsimilar to staphylococcal whitlow, although the exudates is serous rather than purulent. \\nVesicles may also be produced on the skin of head and neck. \\n3. Keratoconjunctivitis \\nInfection of the eye of HSV -1 causes an extremely painful ulceration of cornea and \\nvesiculation of the lids with associated conjunctivitis. In majority of the cases, the primary \\nlesions heal in 2-3 weeks. \\n4. Eczema herpeticum \\nIt is a super infection of eczematous skin. It is mainly seen in young children. Crops \\nof vesicles appear mainly on already eczematous areas with extensive ulceration. This \\nresults in protein loss, dehydration and viraemia. The latter may lead to disseminated \\ndisease with fatal consequences.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 225 \\n5. Encephalitis \\nBoth HSV-1 and HSV-2 can also infect central nervous system leading to herpes \\nencephalitis. The main site of infection is temporal lobe where the disease causes necrosis. \\n6. Generalized infection \\nRarely, primary infection with HSV-1 may lead to generalized disseminated infection. \\nPatient develops acute gingivostomatitis, disseminated vesicular skin lesions, hepatitis \\nand involvement of other organs. \\nHSV-2 causes: \\n1. Genital herpes \\n2. Aseptic meningitis, and \\n3. Neonatal infection \\nIt may rarely cause head and neck infections \\n1. Genital herpes \\nHSV-2 causes one of the most prevalent forms of sexually transmitted diseases. It \\nleads to the development of painful vesicles on the genitalia or anal regions with fever, \\nmalaise and tender, swollen lymph nodes. In the females, lesions may occur on the \\nperineum, vagina, cervix or vulva. In the males, the lesions may occur on the glans, prepuce \\nor shaft of the penis. HSV-2 proctitis has been reported in homosexual men. Majority (80%) \\nof cases of genital herpes are due to HSV-2 and remaining cases are due to HSV-1. These \\ncases are possibly due to orogenital sexual practices. HSV-2 may also be involved in oral \\ninfections. It has also been blamed to cause cervical carcinoma. \\n2. Aseptic meningitis \\nIt may occur as a complication of HSV-2 genital infection. \\n3. Neonatal infection \\nIt is acquired by the neonates usually from their mothers during passage through \\nan infected birth canal, but in some cases it may be acquired in the immediate postnatal \\nperiod from parents and nurses. Prenatally, a very few cases may acquire infection by \\nviraemic transmission across the placenta or by ascending infection from the cervix. This \\nmay result in abortions or congenital defects in the child. If a woman has primary genital \\nherpes at the time of delivery, the risk of neonatal herpes is 30-40%. Therefore, caesarean \\nsection is indicated in such mothers. Most of the cases of neonatal herpes are due to HSV-\\n2, but those acquired postnatally may be due to HSV-1. \\nNeonatal herpes may present as: \\ndisseminated disease, with a case fatality rate of 80% most of the survivors being \\nleft with permanent neurologic or ocular sequelae. \\nencephalitis, with high mortality, and \\ndisease localized to mucocutaneous surfaces such as skin,\\' eye and mouth. \\nLatent infection \\nDuring primary infection, the virus travels from the site of infection in the mouth226 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nto the trigeminal and probably other cranial and cervical ganglia. In genital herpes, HSV-\\n2 travels to sacral ganglia. Within the sensory ganglia, viral DNA exists as a free circular \\nepisome perhaps about 20 copies per infected cells. \\nReactivation and recrudescence \\nReactivation of the virus is provoked by various stimuli such as common cold, fever, \\npneumonia, menstruation, exposure to sunlight stress, etc In infectious virions migrate \\nalong the nerve axon back to the nerve endings, where infection of epithelial cells may \\nresult in cluster of vesicles at the mucocutaneous junctions of the lips, in the nose, or \\neyes or on areas of skin that have experienced a primary infection. Reactivation recurs \\nsporadically, sometimes often, throughout life. \\nControl \\nHSV infection can be successfully treated with acyclovir (acycloguanosine). It acts \\nby interfering with viral DNA synthesis by inhibiting virus DNA-dependent DNA \\npolymerase. For the treatment of ophthalmic herpes simplex infection, it may be used in \\nthe form of ointment. Oral acyclovir 200 mg 5 times daily for 10 days may be used for \\nthe treatment of primary herpes genitalis and orofacial herpes. For the treatment of herpes \\nsimplex encephalitis, neonatal herpes and disseminated infection in immunocompromised \\npatients, intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg, 3 times daily for 2-3 weeks) may be given. \\nVaricella-Zoster Virus (VZV) \\nThe virus was first isolated by weller in human embryonic tissue cultures. VZV \\ncauses varicella (chicken pox) in children and zoster (shingles) in adults and \\nimmunocompromised patients. Varicella follows primary infection in a non-immune \\nindividual while zoster is a reactivation of latent virus when immunity has fallen to \\nineffective levels. A child can catch varicella from an elderly patient with zoster but the \\nlatter occurs only if the elderly or immunocompromised person had suffered from varicella \\nin early part of his life. VZV is similar to the herpes simplex virus in its morphology. \\nThe virus was 1st isolated by Weller in human embryonic tissue culture. \\nVaricella \\nIt is one of the common childhood exanthemata. Portal of entry of the virus is \\nrespiratory tract. Incubation period is about 2 weeks. The source of infection is a chicken \\npox or herpes zoster patient. The portal of entry of virus is the respiratory tract or conjunctiva. \\nAfter an incubation or period of about 2 weeks (7-23 days) the lesion begins to appear. \\nThe earliest manifestation is a maculopopular rash that progresses within a few hours to \\nthe vesicular stage. Vesicles characteristically are surrounded by a red rim. The lesions then \\nrupture and crust or may become secondarily infected and pustular before healing. \\nPocks are centripetal in distribution i.e. they are more profuse on the trunk followed \\nby neck and proximal areas of limbs. Successive crops of vesicles appear over 2-5 days \\nand as a result at anyone time will have lesions at various stages of development on \\nthe same area of the skin. The accompanying fever is usually low grade. The incidenceTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 227 \\nof complications in children is low, the most common problem being secondary infection \\nof lesions and consequent scarring, a problem that can usually be solved by antibiotic \\ntreatment. \\nInfection of adults is generally more severe than in children, the vesicles heal more \\nslowly, secondary bacterial infection and scarring are more common, and the accompanying \\nfever is higher and more prolonged. Some patients of varicella may develop viral \\npneumonitis, encephalitis, Guillain Barre syndrome and Reye\\'s syndrome. Varicella tends \\nto be more serious in pregnancy, if the patient has not been infected during childhood. \\nVZV can cross the placenta following viraemia in the pregnant woman and infect the \\nfoetus. A syndrome of congenital malformations with hypoplasia of limbs, chorioretinitis \\nand scarring of skin associated with maternal varicella in the first trimester may develop. \\nChicken pox in pregnancy can be dangerous for both mother baby. The disease tends \\nto be more serve in pregnant women, with enhanced risks of complications like pneumonia. \\nThe baby may develop two types of complications, depending on the period of gestation \\nwhen the women develops chicken pox. If maternal varicella occurs during the first half \\nof pregnancy, the fetal infection may usually be asymptomatic. Some infants may develop \\nthe fetal varicella syndrome. While varicella is typically a disease of childhood, herpes \\nzoster is one of old age, being common after the age of fifty years. Herpes zoster usually \\noccurs in persons who had chicken pox several years earlier years after the initial infection, \\nwhen the immunity has waned, the virus may be reactivated and triggered by some \\nprecipitating stimulus, travel along the sensory nerve. \\nZoster \\nZoster or shingles is an endogenous reactivation of virus which has remained latent \\nin one or more sensory ganglia following primary varicella many years earlier. Virus \\ntravels down the sensory nerves to produce painful vesicles in the area of skin (dermatome) \\nenervated from the affected ganglion. Thoracic nerves supplying the chest wall are most \\noften affected. When the ophthalmic nerve of trigeminal ganglion is affected the rash is \\ndistributed on the scalp and forehead. In about half of the patients, the eye is affected \\nleading to corneal ulceration, stromal keratitis and anterior uveitis. \\nThe accompanying pain is often very severe for upto a few weeks, and in herpetic \\nneuralgia, which occurs in half of all patients over 60 years of age, may persist for months \\nwhich may require surgical ablation of the ganglion. Zoster of the seventh cranial ganglion \\nmay lead to Bell\\'s palsy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome which is characterized by facial \\nnerve palsy with a rash on the tympanic membrane and the external auditory canal. Zoster \\nmay also cause encephalitis. In immunocompromised and cancer patients, disseminated \\nzoster is sometimes seen. \\nLaboratory diagnosis \\n1. Direct examination of vesicle fluid by electron microscopy may reveal herpes \\nvirus particles. \\n2. Stained smears from the base of the lesion or sections from biopsy tissue show \\nmultinucleated giant cells containing acidophilic intranucelar inclusion bodies.\\'. 228 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n3. Rapid diagnosis is possible by using monoclonal fluorescent antibody technique. \\n4. VZV antigens can be detected in vesicle fluid by ELISA. \\n5. DNA can be extracted from virions in vesicle fluid, amplified by PCR and \\ndetected by nucleic acid hybridization. \\n6. The virus can be isolated from vesicle fluid in human embryonic lung fibroblasts \\nculture. Cytopathic effect is focal with refractile ballooned cells. It develops \\nslowly over a period of 2 or more weeks. However, VZV antigen can be \\ndemonstrated in nuclear inclusions by immuno-fluorescence with monoclonal \\nantibody before the end of first week. \\n7. Recent infection can be diagnosed by ELISA test for varicella-zoster specific \\nIgM antibody in patient serum. \\nAcyclovir and vidarabine given intravenously are effective in the treatment of severe \\nvaricella and zoster (e.g. in the immunocompromised patients). \\nA live attenuated vaccine from Oka strain of VZV, developed by serial passage in \\ncultured human and guinea-pig fibroblasts is available. It is indicated for active \\nimmunization against varicella in healthy subjects from the age of 12 months onwards. \\nA single vaccine dose protects about 90% of recipients for several years. The vaccine \\ninduces fever and a few skin papules, occasionally in normal children but much more \\nfrequently in immunocompromised children. For instance, a significant minority of \\nchildren with leukaemia, or on steroid therapy may develop mild varicella following \\nvaccination. The vaccine may also establish latent infection in dorsal ganglia and may \\nlead to zoster in the years ahead, but such reactivation is less frequent than that following \\nnatural varicella infection. \\nEpstein-Barr Virus (EBV) \\nThe EBV virus is ubiquitous in all human population. EBV has been named after \\nthe virologists (Epstein and Barr) who first observed it under electron microscope in \\ncultures of lymphoblasts from burkitt\\'s lymphoma. EBV replicates in epithelial cells of \\nnasopharynx and salivary glands, especially the parotid, lysing them and releasing \\ninfectious virions into saliva. B lymphocytes appear to become infected when they infiltrate \\ninfected nasopharyngeal mucosa. Inside B cellG, EBV normally fails to replicate but \\nestablishes life long latency. In these cells, EBV genome persists as multiple full-length \\ncopies in the form of circular episomes. EBV has oncogenic properties and a proportion \\nof infected B lymphocytes undergo transformations and transform cells in vitro too. \\nActivated B lymphocytes secrete immunoglobulins especially IgM. \\nEBV possess envelope glycoprotein gp 350/220, which mediates attachment of the \\nvirus to CD21 receptors present on the susceptible cells. Most shedding of virus takes \\nplace in the oral cavity, therefore, transmission of virus requires salivary contact, either \\nthrough kissing or contaminated eating utensils. This accounts for infection mononucleosis \\nbeing called the kissing disease. The source of infection is tissues the saliva of infected \\nperson who shed the virus in orapharangial secretion for months following primary \\ninfection and intermittently thereafter intimate oral contact as in kissing, appears to beTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 229 \\nthe predominant mode of transmission. Most infections are symptomless, especially when \\nacquired during childhood. However, in adolescents it may cause infectious mononucleosis \\nor glandular fever, infections in immunocompromised hosts and when EBV exerts its \\noncogenic potential, it may cause Burkit\\'s lymphoma, B cell lymphoma and nasopharyngeal \\ncarcinoma. \\nInfectious Mononucleosis (Glandular fever) \\nIt is a primary EBV infection seen mainly in the 15-25 years age group. EBV is \\ncommonly transmitted by infected saliva and initiates infection in the oropharynx. Viral \\nreplication occurs in epithelial cells of the pharynx and salivary glands. Many people \\nshed low levels of virus for weeks to months after infection. Following replication in \\nepithelial cells, the virus infects B lymphoid cells, where it persists in a latent state. In \\nnormal individuals, most virus-infected cells are eliminated but small numbers of infected \\nlymphocytes persist for the life-time of the host. \\nEBV-infected B cells synthesize immunoglobulins. Autoantibodies are typical of the \\ndisease. Heterophile antibody that reacts with antigens on sheep erythrocytes is the classic \\nautoantibody. In addition, many autoantibodies react with cytoskeletal components. EBV \\ninfection causes activation of many B cells that are not infected, and these may be the \\nsource of autoantibodies. \\nAfter an incubation period of 4-7 weeks, patient presents with sore throat due to \\nexudative tonsillitis, generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, malaise, headache, sweating, \\nfatigue and gastrointestinal discomfort. In some cases spleen and liver are often enlarged. \\nA faint transient morbilliform rash may be seen. A maculopopular rash may appear, \\nespecially following treatment with ampicillin due to immune complexes with antibody \\nto ampicillin. The disease usually lasts for 2-3 weeks. However, some patients develop \\ncomplications such as Guillain Barre syndrome. Bell\\'s palsym meningoencephalitis, \\ntransverse myelitis, haemolytic, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, carditis, nephritis, pneumonia \\nand splenic rupture. \\nInfections in Immunocompromised Host \\n• EBV causes X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome in male members of certain \\nfamilies with an X-linked recessive immunodeficiency with a reduced ability \\nto synthesize interferon. About half of the boys die, within a month, from sepsis \\nor haemorrhages and remainder develop and die from B celllymphoproliferation \\nwith associated hypogammaglobulinaemia and later lymphoma. \\n• EBV may cause progressive lymphoproliferative disease in transplant recipients, \\nimmunodeficient children and AIDS patients. \\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) \\nIn vivo, CMV replicates in epithelial cells in salivary glands, kidneys and respiratory \\nepithelium. In vitro, they can be isolated on human fibroblast cells. An individual infected \\nwith CMV carries the virus for life and may shed it intermittently in saliva, urine, semen, \\ncervical secretions and breast milk. The virus is found in 0.3-2.4% of population that have230 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nbeen sampled throughout the world. Infection is transmitted by close contact between \\nindividuals and blood transfusion. It may be acquired at any time, i.e. prenatal, perinatal \\nand postnatal. CMV are the largest viruses in the herpesvirus family being 150-200 nm \\nin size. Cytomegaloviruses have been identified in human beings, monkeys, guinea pigs \\nand some other. CMV spreads slowly and probably requires close contact for transmission. \\nIt may spread through salivary or other secretions or by sexual contact. A special method \\nof transmission is by blood transfusion or organ transplants. They are highly infectious \\nin early infancy. \\nPrenatal (intrauterine) infection \\nCMV is the most common agent to cause intrauterine infection and prenatal damage \\nto foetus leading to congenital abnormalities. Approximately 1 % of all babies become \\ninfected in utero. Maternal viraemia following primary CMV infection or a reactivation \\nduring pregnancy may result in foetal infection. Majority (95%) of these are without \\nobvious symptoms at the time of birth and 5% symptomatic infants have cytomegalic \\ninclusion body disease. This infants show signs of growth retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, \\njaundice, thrombocytopenia, microephaly, encephalitis and chlorioretinitis. Of the remaining \\n95% about 15% develop deafness and mental retardation. \\nPost natal infection \\nThis is acquired from infected maternal genital secretions or from breast feeding. \\nPost natal infection \\nThis may be acquired by kissing (from saliva), sexual intercourse or artificial \\ninsemination (from semen), blood transfusion and organ transplantation. \\nInfections acquired it may cause hepatitis in young children. In adults and older \\nchildren, it may cause a syndrome resembling EBV infectious mononucleosis, but with a \\nnegative Paul-Bunnell test and no pharyngitis or lymphadenopathy. CMV may cause widely \\ndisseminated infection in immunocompromised individuals such as graft recipients and \\nAIDS patients leading to interstitial pneumonia, chorioretinitis, hepatitis, arthritis, chronic \\ngastrointestinal infection, encephalitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and transverse myelitis. \\nTreatment \\nFor the treatment of severe CMV infections such as pneumonia, chorioretinitis and \\ncolitis in AIDS patients or in other immunocompromised patients, ganciclovir is the drug \\nof choice. \\nTo produce zoster lesions on the area of the skin or mucosa supplied by it. This \\nreactivation is associated with inflammation of the nerve which accounts for neuritic pain \\nthat often precedes the skin lesions. The rash is typically unilateral and confined to the \\narea supplied by a single sensory ganglion. The rash heals about in two weeks. Pain \\nand parasthesia at the affected area may persist for weeks or months. Other complications \\nare lower motor neuron paralysis which sometimes ensures, meningoencephalitis and \\ngeneralized zoster where the lesions are scattered widely, perhaps due to haematogenous \\ndissemination of the virus.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 231 \\nHerpes zoster represents a mode of evolutionary adaptation by V-2 virus which is \\nobligate human parasite. \\nHuman Herpesvirus 6 \\nHuman herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) with characteristic herpes group features, was \\ndiscovered in human lymphocytes in 1986. It infects dividing CD4 + T lymphocytes. \\nInfected T cells show ballooning with nuclear and/ or cytoplasmic inclusions. Macrophages \\nare also infected. These comprise an important reservoir of HHV-6. It can be isolated from \\nsaliva, thus suggesting that salivary glands may act as major reservoir and the saliva \\nas main route of transmission. It can be cultured on transformed B lymphocytes, NK cells, \\nglial cells, fibroblasts and epithelial cells. \\nMost HHV-6 infections appear to be symptomless. They may, however, causes: \\n1. Exanthema subitum or Roseola infantum: This is a mild facial rash occurring \\ncommonly between 6 months and 3 years of age with sudden onset of fever. \\n2. Mononucleosis with cervical lymphadenopathy: This may occur in a few adults \\ndeveloping primary infection. \\nLaboratory diagnosis \\nHHV-6 can be isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in early febrile stage \\nof the illness by co-cultivation with cord blood lymphocytes. Virus antigen can be detected \\nin the infected cells by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies. Virus genome \\ncan be amplified by PCR. Both virus antigen and antibodies can be detected, in patient \\nserum by ELISA. \\nHuman Herpesvirus 7 \\nHuman herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) was discovered in 1990. Like HHV-6, it may also \\ncause roseola infantum. It is proposed that a new genus Roseolovirus may be created \\nfor HHV-6 and HHV-7, which belong to the sub family betaherpesviriane. Both HHV-\\n6 and HHV-7 infect T lymphocytes using the same CD4 receptors on these cells. \\nHuman Herpesvirus 8 \\nHuman herpesvirus 8 (HHV -8) was identified in 1994. It has been blamed to cause \\nKaposi\\'s sarcoma, which is a commonest tumour in HIV-infected .individuals. DNA \\namplification by PCR is the method of detection of HHV -8. \\nCercopithecine Herpes Virus 1 \\nCercopithecine Herpes Virus 1 or simian herpes B virus or herpes virus simiae is \\nsimilar to herpes simplex virus. It commonly infects old World (Asiatic) macaque monkeys \\ncausing a mild vesicular eruption on the tongue and buccal mucosa similar to primary \\nherpetic stomatitis in humans. Human infection with herpes B virus may be acquired from \\na bite or from handling infected animals. The typical lesions produced are vesicles on \\nthe buccal mucosa, which ulcerate shedding the virus and infecting contacts. Infection \\nhas also been transmitted in the laboratory from infected monkey kidney cell cultures. \\nAfter 5-20 days of exposure patient develops local inflammation at the site of entry, \\nusually on the skin, accompanied by itching, numbness and vesicular lesions. It may be \\nfollowed by fatal ascending myelitis. Diagnosis can be made by:232 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n• electron microscopy of vesicle fluid. \\n• isolation of the virus from blood, vesicle fluid, conjunctival swab and CSF, and \\n• DNA amplification by PCR. \\nAdeno Virus \\nMembers of family Adenoviridae are nonenveloped, icosahedral viruses containing \\nlinear double-stranded DNA that replicates in the nucleus of the infected cell. The family \\ncomprises of two distinct genera: Mastadenovirus and Aviade1lovirus. They possess \\nmammalian and avian adenoviruses respectively. There are 47 serotypes of human \\nadenoviruses, which have been assigned to 6 (A-F) sub-genera. Adenovirus infections are \\ncommon world wide mostly in children. Adenoviruses cause infection of the respiratory \\ntract and eyes and less often of the intestine and urinary tract. \\nHuman adenovirus are classified into six groups (called subgroups as sub genera) \\nbased on properties such as hemagglutination fibre length, DNA fragment analysis and \\noncogenic potential. \\nSub genus \\nA \\nB \\nC \\nD \\nE \\nF \\nMorphology \\nTABLE 13 \\nClassification of Human Adenoviruses \\nSerotype \\n12, 18, 21 \\n3,7,11,14,16,21,34,35 \\n1,2,5,6 \\n8-10,13,15,17,19,20,22-30,32,33,36-39,42-47 \\n4 \\n40,41 \\nTotal \\nAdenoviruses are icosahedral Vinons \\ncontaining double-stranded DNA.

Fig 12 : Morphology of adenovirusTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 233 \\nCultivation \\nHuman adenoviruses can be grown on monolayers of HeLa, HEp-2, KB and human \\nembryo kidney cells. Cytopathic effects may take 1-4 weeks and consist of cell rounding \\nand aggregation in grape-like clusters. Infected cells swell and become balanced and show \\ncharacteristic basophilic intranuclear inclusions in stained preparation. \\nPathogenesis \\nAdenoviruses may infect via the conjunctiva or the nasal mucosa. Faecal-oral spread, \\nparticularly among children can also occur. They multiply initially in the conjunctiva, \\npharynx or small intestine and spread to preauricular, cervical and mesenteric lymph \\nnodes. Most of the enteric and some of the respiratory infections are sub clinical. In \\nchildren, asymptomatic infection of tonsils and adenoids, leading to respiratory carriage, \\nand Peyer\\'s patches, leading to gut carriage, may persist for weeks or months. \\nMost of the adenovirus infections are caused by adenoviruses serotypes 1-8. \\nSerotypes 40 and 41 may cause infantile gastroenteritis, 8, 19 and 37 lead to eye infections \\nand serotypes 19 and 37 may also cause genital infections. Five serotypes (43-47, subgenus \\nD) have been recovered from the faeces of AIDS patients. However, their role in these \\npatients is not known. Adenovirus infections lead to lasting immunity to reinfection with \\nthe same serotype. \\nClinical syndromes \\nIncubation period is 5-8 days after which it may lead to: \\nAdenovirus cause infections of the respiratory tract, eye bladder and intestine more \\nthan one type of virus may produce the same clinical syndrome and one type of virus \\nmay cause clinically different diseases. The following syndrome have been recognized: \\n1. Respiratory infections \\n• Pharyngitis: Serotypes 1-7 are usually responsible for pharyngitis particularly \\nin young children. \\n• Pneumonia: Pneumonia in infants and young children may be caused by any \\nof the common serotypes particularly serotypes 1,2, 3 and 7. In military recruits, \\npneumonia may be caused by serotypes 4 and 7. In infants and young children \\ntype 7 may lead to more serious and even fatal pneumonia. \\n• Acute respiratory disease: This syndrome is characterized by fever, chills, \\npharyngitis, cervical lymphadenitis, non productive cough and malaise. This \\noccurs usually in outbreaks in military recruits when they assemble in camps. \\nIt is generally caused by adenoviruses serotypes 3,4, 7, 14 and 21. \\n2. Ocular infections \\n• Pharyngoconjunctival fever: This syndrome of febrile pharyngitis and \\nconjunctivitis occurs in outbreaks in children. It is usually caused by adenoviruses \\n3, 4, 7 and 14. This is seen in civilian population. \\n• Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis: It is a severe and highly contagious infection \\ninvolving all age groups. It often occurs in epidemic form ahd is characterized234 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nby follicular conjunctivitis and progresses to involve the cornea. It was first \\nassociated with adenovirus type 8, but other serotypes (e.g, 3,4,7, 19 and 37) \\nhave also been incriminated in this syndrome. \\n3. Genitourinary infections \\n• Cervicitis and urethritis: These venereal infections are caused by serotype 37. \\n• Acute haemorrhagic cystitis: It is mainly seen in infants and young children \\nand is caused by serotypes 11 and 21. \\n4. Enteric infections \\n• Infantile gastroenteritis: Serotypes 40 and 41 may cause infantile gastroenteritis \\nin up to 10% of the cases. \\nSome human adenoviruses produce carcinomas if injected into new born hamsters, \\nmice or rats. Infection of cultured hamster or rat cells, in vitro, also results in transformation. \\nHowever, there is no evidence that this can occur in man too. \\nEpidemilogy: Adenovirus are endemic and types 1-7 spread readily between \\nindividuals presumably by droplets. Faecal oral transmission can also occur and probably \\ndoes in areas with poverty poor hygene and over crowding. Type 40 & 41 which are \\nwidespread are causes of diarrhoea even in highly developed countries, also spread via \\ndroplets. \\nAdeno associated viruses \\nEM of adenovirus preparation have shown small icosahedral viral particles 20-25 \\nnm in diameter. They are unable to replicate independently as they lack enough DNA \\nor they contain insufficient single stranded DNA. They can multiply only in cells \\nsimultaneously infected with adenoviruses and are called adeno associated viruses (AA V) \\nor adenosatellite viruses. They have been classified as the genus dependovirus (referring \\nto their dependence on adenoviruses) under the family parvoviridae. Type 1, 2 and 3 of \\nhuman origin and cause natural infection while type 4 is of simian origin. Their \\npathogenic role is uncertain. \\nControl \\nThere are no anti viral drugs available that are unequivocally effective for the \\ntreatment of adenoviral infections. Ribavirin, ganciclovir, vidarabine and cidofavir have \\nall been shown to have antiviral activity in vitro and there are anecdotal report of their \\ntherapeutic use in immuno compromised patients with variable success. \\nPOLYOMA VIRUS \\nPolyomavirus The name is derived from \\'poly\\' (many) and oma (tumour). The \\nviruses are species specific, recognized members of this group include the mouse \\npolyomavirus, SV40 of monkeys and two viruses of man JC virus and BKV. Both named \\nafter the initials of the people from whom they were first isolated. SV 40 stands for simian \\nvirus 40. Its double stranded DNA has been exploited the most as vectors for gene transfer \\ninto animal cells.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 235 \\nDuring 1950\\' s the widespread use of monkey kidney cells for isolating polioviruses \\nand preparing vaccine brought to light many viruses that caused in apparent infections, \\nnot until the cells were explanted into culture vessels did cytopathic effects become \\nobvious. These agents were termed \\'Simian viruses\\' one of them that induced a vacuolated \\nor foamy appearance in the cytoplasm was termed SV 40. \\nPolyomaviruses: SV 40 \\nSome viruses of the polyomavirus family induce tumors in animals. One of these \\nDNA tumor viruses was first isolated from monkeys, and it was thus called simian virus \\n40 or SV40. Virus SV 40 was one of the first genetic elements to be studied by genetic \\nengineering techniques and has been extensively used as a vector for moving genes into \\neukaryotic cells. \\nThe SV 40 virion is a non enveloped particle 45 nm in diameter with an icosahedral \\nhead containing 72 protein subunits. Unlike RNA viruses, there are no enzymes in the \\nvirion. The genome of SV 40 consists of one molecule of double-stranded DNA of 5243 \\nbp. The DNA is circular and exist in a supercoiled configuration within the virion. The \\ncomplete base sequences of SV 40 has been determined. \\nSV 40 nucleic acid is replicated in the nucleus, while the proteins are synthesized \\nin the cytoplasm. Final assembly of the virion occurs in the nucleus.\" The replication of \\nthese viruses can be divided into two distinct stages, early and late. During the early stage, \\nthe early region of the viral DNA is transcribed. A single RNA molecule, the primary \\ntranscript, is made by cellular RNA polymerase, but it is processed into two mRNAs, a \\nlarge one and a small one. Introns are present in the SV40 genome, so they are excised \\nout of the primary RNA transcript. In the cytoplasm, the mRNAs are capped and translated \\nto yield two proteins. One of these proteins, the T-antigen, binds to the site on the parental \\nDNA that is the origin of replication, this initiates viral genome synthesis. \\nThe genome of SV40 is too small to encode its own DNA polymerases, so host DNA \\npolymerases are used. Replication occurs in a bidirectional fashion from a single origin \\nof replication. The process involves the same events that have already been described for \\nhost cell DNA replication. \\nLate SV40 mRNA molecules are synthesized using the strand complementary to that \\nused for early mRNA synthesis. Transcription begins at a promoter near the origin of \\nreplication. This late RNA is then processed by splicing, capping, and polyadenylation \\nto yield mRNA corresponding to the three coat proteins, VP1, VP2, and VP3. SV 40 coat \\nprotein mRNAs are then transported to the cytoplasm and translated into the viral coat \\nproteins. The latter are then transported back into the nucleus where virion assembly takes \\nplace. Release of new SV40 virions occurs by cell lysis. Within the permissive monkey \\ncells two genes are expressed immediately after infection. These early genes represent two \\ntumour causing antigens, namely small tumour (t) and a large tumour (T) proteins. \\nSome polyomaviruses cause cancer. When a virus of the polyomavirus group infects \\na host cell, one of two modes of replication can occur, depending on the type of host \\ncell. In some types of host cells, known as permissive cells, virus infection results in the \\nusual formation of new virions and the lysis of the host cell. In other types of host cells,236 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nknown as non permissive, efficient multiplication does not occur. Instead, the virus DNA \\nbecomes integrated into host DNA, analogous to a prophage in the process genetically \\naltering the cells. Such cells can show loss of growth inhibition and become tumor cells, \\na process called transformation. As in certain tumorigenic retroviruses, expression of \\nspecific polyomavirus genes leads cells to the transformed state. \\nMost double-stranded DNA animal viruses, such as SV40, replicate in the nucleus. \\nSV40 has a tiny genome and employs the strategy of overlapping genes to boost its genetic\\xad\\ncoding potential. Some of these viruses cause cancer. \\nHEPATITIS VIRUSES \\nThe term \\'viral hepatitis\\' refers to primary infection of the liver by anyone of a \\nheterogenous group of \\'hepatitis viruses\\' which currently consist of types A, B, C, D, E \\nand G. Type F had been proposed for a putative virus believed to cause transfusion \\nassociated hepatitis. \\nHepatitis virus are taxonomically unrelated except type B. Which is a DNA virus \\nall others are RNA virus. The differentiation is based on their serological and molecular \\nmarkers. Hepatitis F proved to be a mutant of type B virus and not a separate entity. \\nTherefore, it has been deleted from the list of hepatitis viruses. Non viral causes of hepatitis \\ninclude Leptospira, Treponema pallidum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Toxoplasma gondii and \\nEntamoeba histolytica. In the United States, hepatitis B, A and C account for about 40%, \\n30% and 20% respectively. In about 2% cases, hepatitis D occurs in concert with hepatitis \\nB. Only a handful of hepatitis E cases are reported every year, none originating in the \\nUnited States. All are in travellers coming back from countries where the virus is endemic. \\nAll types of viral hepatitis produce clinically similar illnesses. These range from \\nasymptomatic and inapparent to fulminant and fatal acute infections common to all types, \\non one hand, and from sub clinical persistent infections to rapidly progressive liver disease \\nwith cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma, common to the blood-borne types (HBV, \\nHCV & HDV), on the other. Without specific virological tests, it is not possible to determine \\nwhich hepatitis virus is responsible for a case of hepatitis. On the basis of epidemiological \\nand clinical criteria, two types of viral hepatitis are known one type occurred sporadically \\nor as epidemics, affecting mainly children and young adults and transmitted by fecal\\xad\\noral route. This is called infective or infectious hepatitis called type A hepatitis. Second \\ntype of viral hepatitis, transmitted mainly by inoculation was originally observed in \\npersons receiving serum inoculation or blood transfusion called as serum jaundice, serum \\nhepatitis transfusion hepatitis called as type B hepatitis. Soon a type C virus was identified \\nas causing many transfusion associated hepatitis cases. A defective virus which depends \\non the helper functions of type B virus was called delta or type D hepatitis viruses another \\ntype of hepatitis transmitted by the facial oral route prevalent only in developing nations \\nis due to E virus. The sixth member of this group hepatitis G virus can also cause hepatitis \\nbut its role is not yet been understood. \\nBoth HA V & HEV are shed in high titres in the faeces of infected individuals. In \\neach case, the virus present in faeces is replicated primarily in the liver & reaches the \\nintestinal tract following secretions from the hepatocytes into biliary canaliculi andTABLE 14 ..., \\n::z: Hepatitis viruses m \\n> \\nFeature Hepatitis A virus Hepatitis B virus Hepatitis C virus Hepatitis D virus Hepatitis E virus Hepatitis G ~ \\nrs:: virus > t\"\" \\nYear of identification 1973 1965 1989 1977 1980 1995 <: \\nFamily Picomaviridae Hepadnaviridae Flaviviridae Unclassified Caliciviridae Flaviviridae .... \\n~ \\nc::: \\nGenus Hepatovlrsu Orthohepadnavirus Hepacivirus Deltavirus Unnamed Hepacivirus C/l \\nm \\nC/l \\nGenome ssRNA dsDNA ssRNA ssRNA ssRNA ssRNA \\nGenome size 7.5 kb 3.2 kb 9.4 kb 1.7 kb 7.6 kb 9.4 kb \\nVirion 27nm, icosahedral 42 nm, spherical 30-60 nm, spherical 36-38 nm, spherical 27-38 nm, icosahedral? \\nEnvelope No Yes (HBsAg) Yes Yes (HBsAg) No ? \\nStability Heat & acid-stable Acid-stable Ether & acid-sensitive Acid-sensitive Heat-stable ? \\nTransmission Faecal-oral Parental, sexual Parental, sexual Parental, sexual Feacal-oral Parental, \\nsexual \\nVertical transmission \\n- Intrauterine No Yes Possible but rare Possible but rare Yes ? \\n- Perinatal No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \\n- Early post natal infection Possible but rare Possible but rare Possible ? ? ? \\nIncubation period 2-6 weeks 6 weeks-6 months 6-8 weeks 6 weeks-6 months 2-8 weeks ? \\nOnset Acute Insidious or acute Insidious Insidious or acute Acute ? \\nAge preference Children, young adults Young adults, babies, Any age but more Any age Young to middle age ? \\ntoddlers common in adults adults \\nAntigens HAV HBsAg, HBcAg, .

The absence of a lipid envelope is an important factor \\nin this process, as it renders both HA V and HEV stable when suspended in bile. In \\ncontrast, the other human hepatitis viruses possess an outer envelope and are likely to \\nbe rapidly inactivated in bile. The newly replicated HA V and HEV particles \\nhave a direct route to the outside environment that is denied to other hepatitis \\nviruses. \\nHepatitis A virus (HA V) \\nIt is a subacute disease of global distribution affecting mainly children and young \\nadults. HAVis a 27 nm non enveloped RNA virus belonging to the picornavirus family. \\nOnly one serotypes of the virus is known. Natural infection with HAVis seen only in \\nhumans. Type A hepatitis occurs sporadically or as outbreaks which may be caused by \\ncontaminated food, water or milk. In India, type A hepatitis is the most common cause \\nof acute hepatitis in children but is much less frequent in adults. \\nHepatitis A virus (HA V) was previously classified as enterovirus type 72. HAVis \\na nonenveloped 27 nm icosahedral virus containing linear, single-stranded RNA, 7.5 kb \\nin length and of positive polarity (Table). It has only one serotype. HAVis one of the \\nmost stable viruses infecting humans. It can withstand heating at 60°C for one hour and \\ntreatment with 20% ether, acid (pH 1.0 for 2 hours) and many disinfectants. Inactivation \\nof viral activity can be achieved by boiling for 1 minute, by contact with formaldehyde \\nand chlorine, or by ultraviolet irradiation. It can be transmitted to chimpanzes and several \\nspecies of marmoset monkeys and can be grown in cell cultures of primate and human \\ncells. HAVis the only one of the human hepatitis viruses that can be cultivated in vitro. \\nPathogene\\'sis \\nHAV is shed early in the stools of infected individuals, 1-2 weeks prior to the onset \\nof symptoms, and persists for the first several days after the transaminase levels peak. \\nThere is very little virus in the serum and hardly any at all in other body fluids which \\nexplains the epidemiology of the disease as faecal-oral enteric infection. Transfusion\\xad\\nassociated hepatitis A is exceedingly rare. It probably multiplies first in the intestinal \\nepithelial cells and then spreads to the liver via the blood. Viral antigens can be seen \\nin the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. \\nHA V occurs throughout the world and is endemic in countries with substandard \\nhygiene and sanitation, so the vast majority of native population have detectable anti\\xad\\nHAV by the age of 10 years. In developed countries, acute hepatitis A tends to be a sporadic \\novert febrile illness. \\nHepatitis A is an acute self-limiting disease with an incubation period of 2-6 weeks. \\nThe onset is abrupt with fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea and lethargy which comprise \\nthe prodromal (preicteric) stage. Hepatomegaly, due to cell necrosis, causes blockage of \\nthe biliary excretions resulting in jaundice. It may also produce pain in the right upper \\nabdominal quadrant. The fulminant form of hepatitis A and liver failure can occur in \\nless than 0.5% cases. Complete recovery occurs in 8-12 weeks. Hepatitis A has no appears \\nadverse effect on the outcome of pregnancy. Transmission during birth by exposure toTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 239 \\nmaternal faeces or by breast-feeding has been reported. Type A hepatitis occurs sporadically, \\nwhich may be caused by contaminated food, water or milk. \\nThe severity of the disease varies with age. Only 5% of the children under 3 years \\nof age develop jaundice, while more than 50% of adults develop it. Fatality rate is also \\nmore in adults. In contrast to hepatitis B, hepatitis A infection does not produce \\nextrahepatic manifestations, no carrier state and is not associated with cirrhosis or \\nhepatocellular carcinoma. In India, most individuals are infected early in life, up to the \\nage of 15 and the disease is mild. However, over the next several decades, as standards \\nof hygiene including water supply improve, HA V will become a disease of adults in India, \\nas it is in the US. \\nProphylaxis \\n1. Proper collection, treatment and disposal of sewage. \\n2. Bathing and cultivation of shellfish for human consumption should not be \\nallowed near sewerage outlets. \\n3. Passive immunization with normal human immunoglobulin (NJG) gives protection \\nto sero-negative individuals for a period of 4-6 months. It is recommended for the personnel \\ntravelling to highly endemic areas of the tropics and for the control of outbreaks in \\ninstitutions such as homes for the mentally handicapped. Hepatitis A vaccine consisting \\nof formalin inactivated preparation of virions grown in human fibroblasts or monkey \\nkidney cell lines, adsorbed to alum as an adjuvant can be used for active immunization. \\nTwo doses injected one month apart with or without a booster after 6 months elicit a \\ngood immune response in 99% of vaccines lasting for some years. Because of the low \\nyield of virus from cultured cells the vaccine is costly. It may be given to high risk \\nindividuals like long-term visitors to countries in which HAVis endemic, sewage workers, \\nsexually active homosexual men and intravenous drug users. \\nHepatitis B Virus (HBV) \\nType B hepatitis is the most widespread and most important type of viral hepatitis. \\nTotal 1/3 of the world populations is estimated to be infected by HB virus. A quarter \\nof these develop serious liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and primary \\nhepatic cancer. \\nThe family Hepadnaviridae contains 5 hepatotropic viruses specific for man (HBV), \\nwood chuck (WHV), ground squirrel (GSHV), duck (DHBV) and heron (HHBV). All these \\nviruses are highly species specific, for example, the heron HBV does not infect ducks, \\nand the wood chuck virus does not infect ground squirrels. These viruses contain double\\xad\\nstranded DNA genomes and induce persistent infections in their natural hosts. HBV, WHV \\nand GSHV have been associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Only \\nHBV causes human infection, therefore, only this virus will be discussed further. \\nMorphology \\nHBV or Dane particle is a complex 42 nm double shelled particle.

It encloses an inner icosahedral 27 nm nucleocapsid (core). It contains \\nhepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg). Inside the core is the genome of HBV and a DNA\\xad\\ndependent DNA polymerase. The HBV genome consists of a 3.2 kilobase pair molecule \\nof circular dsDNA of most unusual structure. The plus strand is inco\"mplete leaving 15-\\n50% of the molecule single-stranded. The minus strand is complete and contains four \\noverlapping open reading frames (genes) coding for multiple proteins. \\n1. The P gene (or POL), which comprises 80% of the genome and overlaps all the \\nother genes, encodes DNA polymerase with three distinct enzymatic functions (DNA \\npolymerase, reverse transcriptase, and RNase H) \\n2. 5 gene encodes the envelope protein, which occurs in three forms a large protein, \\ntranslated from pre-51, pre-52, plus 5 regions of the genome and occurs in the envelope \\nof infectious virions; a middle-sized protein comprises the product of pre-52 plus 5; and \\nfinally the most abundant product is the 5 protein, the basic constituent of non-infectious \\nHBsAg particles, the product of 5 gene only. \\n3. The C gene has two initiation sites that divide it into a pre-C and a C region, \\nproducing two distinct proteins, HBeAg and HBcAg respectively.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 241 \\n4. Gene X, spanning the cohesive ends of the genome encodes for HBxAg, which \\ncan transactivate the transcription of cellular and viral genes, its clinical relevance is not \\nknown. \\nFrom the core protein is derived hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg). It is associated with \\nthe virion and is also found free in the plasma, especially when there is active viral \\nreplication. \\nAlong with the mature virions, two sub virion morphologically forms are formed \\nin large excess. (1) Spherical particles with a diameter of 22 nm and (2) Elongated tubules \\nof similar diameter. Both these pleomorphic structures are composed of HBsAg, are devoid \\nof HBcAg and nucleic acid. They are not infectious and consists solely of surplus virion \\nenvelope. They normally occur in large (100 to 1,000 fold excess over the mature 42 nm \\nvirions. \\nHBsAg carries a group-specific antigen \\'a\\' and two type -specific antigens, \\'d\\' or \\n\\'y\\' and \\'w\\' or \\'r\\'. Thus there are four antigenic types of HBsAG - adw, adr, ayw and \\nayr. Type ayw is predominant in Africa, Russia and India, particularly in parenteral drug \\nusers. Type adw is predominant in Europe and USA particularly in homosexual men and \\ntype adr is predominant in Asia. The w antigen has additional four variants and \\nadditional antigens such as \\'q\\', \\'x\\' and \\'g\\' have been identified, but they have not been \\ncharacterized. HBV is present in the blood mainly in the form of HBsAg and to smaller \\nextent as Dane particles. \\nHBV has not been cultivated in the laboratory. Experiments on chimpanzee \\ninoculation reveal that the virus gets inactivated by heating at 60°C for 10 minutes and \\nby treatment with hypochlorite (10,000 ppm available chlorine) and 2% glutaraldehyde \\nin 10 minutes. \\nPathogenesis \\nThere are three important modes of transmission of HBV infection: parenteral, \\nperinatal and sexual. \\n1. Parenteral transmission: HBV is present in the blood and in body fluids such \\nas semen, vaginal secretions, menstrual discharge, saliva, colostrums and breast milk. The \\nconcentration of HBV in blood and body fluids is much greater than HIV. Less than 1 \\nIII of blood contaminating a syringe or needle, can readily transmit hepatitis B from one \\nindividual to another. Transmission of infection may result from accidential inoculation \\nof minute amounts of blood or fluid containing HBV during medical, surgical or dental \\nprocedures. Needlestic injuries, use of contaminated needles and syringes, intravenous \\nand percutaneous drug abuse, ear and nose piercing, tattooing, acupuncture, sharing of \\nshaving razor and kissing can transmit HBV infection. HBsAg has been demonstrated \\nin several species of mosquitoes and bed bugs, but transmission of infection by arthropods \\nhas not been authenticated. Professionals occupationally at risk include dentists, surgeons, \\npathologists, mortuary attendants and technicians working in serology, haematology, \\nblood bank biochemistry, microbiology and haemodialysis units. \\nEpidemiology: Hepatitis B occurs throughout the world. There is no seasonal242 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\ndistribution. The infection is usually sporadic, though occasional outbreaks have occurred \\nin hospitals, orphanages and institutions for the mentally handicapped. \\nThe prevalence of hepatitis carriers varies widely in different countries, in relation \\nto their living standards. The overpopulated under developed regions have high endemicity \\n(carrier rate more than 8% as in equatorial Africa, South East Asia, China, parts of South \\nAmerica); low endemicity in the developed countries (carrier rate less than 2% in Western \\nEurope, North America, Australia) and intermediate endemicity in other areas (carrier rate \\n2 to7%, as in Eastern Europe, the middle east south Asia and parts of South America). \\nIndia falls in the intermediate group, with higher carrier rates in the southern part of \\nthe country and lower rates in the northern part. \\nThe rich and the poor countries also differ in the age and modes of infection. In \\nthe former, infection occurs mostly in adolescents and young adults through contaminated \\nsyringes and needles, typically among drug addicts, and through sex, particularly by \\nhomosexual intercourse. In the poor countries, infection occurs usually at younger ages, \\neither perina tally from mother to baby, or horizontally among children. \\nNatural infection occurs only in humans. There is no animal reservoir. The virus \\nis maintained in the large pool of carrier whose blood contains circulating virus for long \\nperiods, in some even lifelong. A carriers is a person with detectable HBsAg in blood \\nfor more than 6 months. Following infection, about 5-10% of adults, 30% of children and \\n90% of neonates become carriers. The carrier state is more common among males. There \\nare over 350 million carriers now worldwide. Of them, about 45 million are in India, which \\nhas the second largest carrier pool, next only to China. \\nTransfusion of carrier blood, once the most widely known mode of infection has \\nlargely been eliminated wherever donor screening is strictly enforced. Therapeutic and \\nprophylactic preparations from pooled human blood and serum have led to hepatitis, but \\nthis risk is now\\'minimal, with screening of donors and production techniques ensuring \\nvirus inactivation. However HBsAg screening is not a totally fail safe method as infection \\nhas occurred even with HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive blood, which may have had \\nundetectable amounts of virus. \\nMany other therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic and even non medical procedures \\nare now the main modes of infection. HBV is very highly infectious, far more than HIV. \\nAny object or procedure than can convey minute traces of infected blood or other material, \\nas little as 0.00001 ml, can be infectious. These include shared syringes, needles and other \\nsharp items or endoscopes, personal articles such as razors, nail clippers and combs, and \\npractices such as acupuncture, tattooing, ritual circumcision, ear or nose piercing, and \\nfield camps for surgery or disease detection by blood testing where separate sterile articles \\nmay not be available. Professionals using sharp articles like barbers, dentists and doctors \\nmay unwittingly transmit the virus if great care is not taken. \\nInfection by direct contact with open skin lesions such as pyoderma, eczema, cuts \\nand scratches is very common among young children in developing countries as also \\nthrough household transmission where opportunities exist for contact with blood or saliva \\namong members.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 243 \\nHBV has been shown to survive in mosquitoes and bed bugs for about 2 weeks \\nafter blood meal, but no virus multiplication occurs. They do not appear to transmit the \\ninfection. \\nCongenital or vertical transmission is quite common from carrier mothers. The risk \\nto babies is high if the mother is HBeAg positive (60-90%) and low if negative (5-15%). \\nTrue congenital infection (in utero, transplacental) is rare. Infection is usually acquired \\nduring birth by contact of maternal blood with the skin and mucosa of the fetus, or in \\nthe immediate postnatal period. infection by ingestion has been reported, but its efficiency \\nis very low. However it is safer if carrier mothers do not breast feed when proper nutrition \\nof their babies can be otherwise ensured. HBV infected neonates generally do not suffer \\nfrom any clinical illness, but remain carriers for life and some of them may develop \\nhepatocellular carcinoma after many decades. \\nSexual transmission of HBV occurs everywhere, but is more important in the \\ndeveloped countries, particularly in the promiscuous homosexual. The risk of transmission \\nby heterosexual and homosexual contact increase with the number of partners and the \\nduration of such relationships. HBV infection has occurred after artificial insemination. \\nSemen donor screening a therefore obligatory. \\nCertain groups and occupations carry a high risk of infection. These include medical \\nand paramedical personnel, staff or blood banks, dialysis units, medical laboratories and \\nmental health institutions, barbers and sex workers. Dentists and doctors have been \\nresponsible for small outbreaks. In non-endemic countries like Britain HEV carriers are \\nbarred from invasive medical plactice. Carriers are also not permitted to be medical \\nstudents. \\nThe only safe and effective measure for prevention is universal active immunization. \\nIts success has been demonstrated in some highly endemic areas like Taiwan where the \\ncarrier rate fell from 18% in 1986 to 8% in 1993 following immunization. In 1992, the \\nWorld Health Assembly recommended the integration of hepatitis B vaccine into the \\nnational immunization programmes of all nations by 1997. More than 80 countries have \\nconformed. India is one of the few countries yet to initiate this measure mainly because \\nof the high cost of imported vaccine. Now that the vaccine is manufactured in India, and \\nis available at lower cost, it should be possible to include this is the national immunization \\nschedule. \\n2. Perinatal transmission: HBV can be transmitted from carrier mothers to their \\nbabies during the perinatal period. Transmission probably occurs when maternal blood \\ncontaminates the mucous membranes of the new born during birth. Infection may also \\nresult from haematogenous transplacental transmission, breast-feeding and close postnatal \\ncontact between infant and the infected parent. Perinatal infection and infection during \\nthe first year of life have important consequences because 90% of these infants become \\nchronic carriers, as compared to 10% of those infected after the age of 6 years. Such \\nchronicity increases the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. \\n3. Sexual transmission: Since HBV is present in semen and vaginal secretions, \\ntherefore, it can be transmitted by sexual contact. Sexually promiscuous individuals244 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nparticularly male homosexuals are at very high risk. Most of the HBV infections are \\nsubclinical, particularly in childhood. \\nThe course of acute HBV infection can be divided into three phases: preicteric, icteric \\nand convalescent. \\n(A) Preicteric (prodromal) phase: After an incubation period of 6 weeks to 6 months \\npatient develops malaise, anorexia, weakness, myalgia, nausea, vomiting and pain in the . \\nright upper abdominal quadrant. A minority of patients develop arthralgia, urticarial or \\nmaculopapular rash, polyarteritis nodosa and glomerulonephritis. These features may be \\nrelated to circulating immune complexes. \\n(B) Icteric phase: Two days to two weeks following the initial symptoms patient \\ndevelops jaundice, pale stools and dark urine (bilirubinuria). Hepatocellular damage is \\ndetectable biochemically before the onset of jaundice and persists after it has resolved. \\n(C) Convalescent phase: This phase is long and drawn out with malaise and fatigue \\nlasting for several weeks. The duration of uncomplicated hepatitis is rarely more than \\n8-10 weeks, but mild symptoms may persist for more than one year. The incubation period \\nis long (1-6 months). About 90-95% of adults with acute hepatitis B infection recover within \\n1-2 months of onset and eliminate the virus from the body within about 6 months \\nremaining immune thereafter. Mortality is 0.5 -2% but may be more in post transfusion \\ncases. \\nHBV infection occurs virtually in every country of the world. The carrier rate in \\nIndia is estimated to be 5%. Mild cases that do not result in jaundice are termed anicteric. \\nLess than 1 % of the iceteric cases die of fulminant hepatitis, 90-95% recover with complete \\nregeneration of the damaged liver within 2-3 months. The remaining patients progress \\nto chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatoma cells often \\ncontain HBV DNA, but the patient is usually negative for HBcAg and other indications \\nof ongoing viral replication. Integration of HBV DNA fragments into the hepatocyte \\ngenome is a frequent event during HBV infection. \\nHepatitis B carriers \\nHBV replicates within hepatocytes viral DNA exist in hepatocyte nucleus in the \\nfree extrachromosomal state or integrated with the cell chromosome. DNA is synthesized \\nfrom an RNA template by reverse transcriptase. \\nAbout 5-10% of HBV infections result in chronic carrier state. The latter may be \\ndefined as persistence of HBsAg in the circulation for more than six months. Carriers \\nare of two types: \\n1. Super carriers: They have HBeAg, high titres of HBsAg and DNA polymerase \\nin their blood. HBV may also be demonstrable in their blood. Very minute amount of serum \\nor blood from such carriers can transmit the infection. \\n2. Simple carriers: These are more common types of carriers who have low level \\nof HBsAg and no HBeAg, HBV and DNA polymerase in the blood. They transmit the \\ninfection only when large volumes of blood are transferred as in blood transfusion.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 245 \\nTABLE 15 \\nSerological Markers of Hepatitis B Inf~ction \\nClinical condition Serological marker \\nHBsAg HBeAg Anti-HBs Anti-HBe Anti-HBc HBV DNA \\nIgM IgG \\nIncubation period \\nAcute hepatitis \\nChronic active hepatitis \\nAsymptomatic carrier state \\nPast infection \\n+ \\n+ \\n+ \\n+ \\nImmunization without infection -\\nProphylaxis \\n+ \\n+ \\n+ \\n+ \\n+ + + \\n+ + + \\n+ + \\n+ + \\n+ \\nMeasures for the control of HBV infection are the same as those for HIV infection \\ni.e. screening of blood donors, use of sterile disposable syringes and needles by the medical \\npersonnel and parenteral drug users, reduction of the number of sexual partners, the use \\nof condoms, etc. Medical personnel should wear gloves, gowns, masks and eyeglasses \\nto prevent exposure to blood and body fluids, avoidance of mouth - pipetting, eating or \\nsmoking in the place of work and proper hand washing after work. Blood spills should \\nbe cleaned up with 2% glutaraldehyde or 0.5% sodium hypochlorite. Disposable equipments \\nshould be incinerated and other equipments should be properly sterilized. \\nPassive immunization: Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) , is prepared from \\ndonors with high titres of anti-HBs. It can be given in the doses of 300-500 IV \\nintramuscularly after accidental exposure, as may occur by needlestick injury or by \\nsplashing of blood from an HBsAg positive patient. HBIG should be administered as early \\nas possible after exposure and preferably within 48 hours. A second dose is usually given \\n4 weeks after the first. Passive immunization is also effective in reducing the risk of the \\ncarrier state in babies born to infectious mothers. HBIG must be given as early as possible \\nbut not later than 12 hours after birth. When this is repeated at monthly intervals for \\nup to six months, the proportion of babies who become carriers can be reduced by about \\n70%. \\nGreater protection is provided by combined passive and active immunization in post \\nexposure prophylaxis. It is advisable to give the injections into different sites. Babies also \\nrespond to vaccine. The protective efficacy of the combined treatment is 90%. \\nlike: \\nActive Immunization: Immunization against HBV is required for high risk individuals \\n• health care personnel especially those in direct contact with blood and sharp \\ninstruments. \\n• patients & health care personnel of institutions for the mentally retarded. \\n• patients requiring repeated transfusion of blood and blood products.246 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n• patients on maintenance dialysis. \\n• patients receiving prolonged inpatient treatment \\n• patients who require frequent tissue penetration \\n• parenteral drug users \\n• sexually promiscuous individuals and prostitutes, and \\n• spouses of those known to be infected with HBV. \\nFollowing vaccines are available: \\n1. Plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine: It consists of purified 22 nm particles of \\nHBsAg, prepared from the plasma of symptomless carriers. The particles are separated \\nby ultracentrifugation and treated with proteinase, 8 M urea and formaldehyde. The \\nchemical treatment inactivates HBV, HIV and other contaminating viruses. The product \\nis immunogenic and safe. This vaccine is still being produced and used, particularly in \\ndeveloping countries where the need is greatest. \\n2. Recombinant yeast hepatitis B vaccine: It is produced by cloning the HBsAg \\ngene in yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisae and the HBsAg particles produced are extracted and \\npurified for use as vaccine. This vaccine is safe, antigenic, free from side effects and as \\nimmunogenic as plasma-derived vaccine. \\nBoth vaccines are absorbed with aluminium hydroxide as adjuvant, stored in cold \\nbut not frozen and are injected intramuscularly into the deltoide regions in a course of \\nthree doses given at 0, 1 and 6 months. Care should be taken to avoid injection into fat \\nas this may produce poorer seroconversion rates. \\n3. Recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell hepatitis vaccine: Expression \\nsystem of CHO cells has been successfully used and the product is commercially available. \\nT~is is the first vaccine using mammalian cell expression system. \\n4. Synthetic peptide vaccines: As the name indicates these are chemically synthesized \\npolypeptide vaccines. These are safe and cheap. These are still under ~xperimental stage. \\n5. Hybrid virus vaccine: Potential live vaccines using recombinant vaccinia virus \\nhave been prepared for hepatitis B, influenza, rabies, epsteinbarr and human \\nimmunodeficiency viruses. Recombinant vaccines can be generated by incorporating \\nforeign genes (HBsAg sequences in case of HBV) into vaccinia virus DNA. Animal cells \\nare first infected with vaccinia virus. Subsequently, a plasmid containing the foreign gene \\nof interest and promotor and thymidine kinase sequences from vaccinia virus is introduced. \\nDuring replication of vaccinia virus DNA, the plasmid sequences are also replicated and \\nchimeric viral DNA containing the foreign gene is produced. Recombinant vaccinia virus \\nexpresses proteins (HBsAg in case of HBV) encoded by foreign gene. The advantages of \\nvaccinia virus recombinant vaccine include low cost, long shelf-life and possible use of \\npolyvalent antigens. \\nHepatitis C Virus (HCV) \\nHCV infection is seen only in humans. The source of infection is the large number \\nof carriers about 200 million world wide. A virus of growing importance, hepatitis C virus, \\n•THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 247 \\nbelongs to the family Flaviviridae. It measures 30-60 nm in diameter. It can be inactivated \\nby exposure to chloroform, ether and other organic solvents and by detergents. Its genome \\nconsists of a single 9.4 kb molecule of ssRNA of positive polarity (Table). A comparison \\nof HCV genomic sequences from around the world has shown substantial heterogeneity \\nof nucleotide sequences within several regions of the viral genomes. On the basis of these \\ngenomic differences, HCV has been classified into 11 genotypes and each genotype has \\nseveral subtypes. This makes vaccine development difficult. Only a polyvalent vaccine \\ncontaining several genotypes is likely to be protective. HCV is difficult to grow in tissue \\nculture. It has been proposed that hepatitis C & G should be placed in a separate genus \\nof the family Flaviviridae to be called Hepacivirns. \\nHCV transmission occurs by needlestick injuries or cuts with sharps, use of \\ncontaminated needles and syringes, transfusion of unscreened blood and sexual intercourse. \\nHCV can be transmitted in utero, during parturition and by breast milk. Transmission \\nby saliva and tears cannot be excluded. HCV transmission from a conjunctival blood \\nsplash has also been reported. Infection is mainly by blood transfusion and other modes \\nof contact with infected blood/blood products. HCV is reported to be an important cause \\nof chronic liver disease in South India. \\nIncubation period of hepatitis C averages 6-8 weeks though it may range upto several \\nmonths. About 75% infections are subclinical. The danger from hepatitis C is not the acute \\ndisease but the persistence of infection. As compared to hepatitis B, clinical infection with \\nhepatitis C is generally less severe, has shorter preicteric period, milder symptoms, absent \\nor less marked jaundice, somewhat lower serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels \\nand the case-fatality rate from fulminant hepatitis is 1 % or less. \\nHowever, 85% or more of the acute HCV infections become chronic. The affected \\nindividuals have persistence of the virus in their blood, elevated ALT levels for at least \\na year or two or more and they are at risk, just as in hepatitis B, of developing cirrhosis \\nand hepatocellular carcinoma. \\nDiagnosis of HCV infection can be established by detection of anti-HCV by ELISA, \\nviral genome by PCR, and by immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization on biopsy \\nand autopsy specimens. \\nProphylaxis \\nHCV infection can be prevented by screening of blood donors, (ivoidance of use of \\nunsterile needles for intravenous drug abuse, tattooing and for medical and dental \\nprocedures. Many of the public health measures adopted to prevent transmission of human \\nimmunodeficiency virus and HBV by parenteral routes will assist efforts at controlling HCV. \\nHepatitis D Virus (HDV) \\nIn 1977 Rizzetto and Colleagues in Italy identified a new viral antigen in the liver \\ncell nuclei of patients infected with hepatitis B virus. The HOV is a defective satellite virus \\nrequiring HBV as helper virus. It is sphereical , 36-38 nm in diameter with HBsAg coat \\n& HOAg nucleoprotein. The genome consists of a single small circular molecule of minus ~ \\nsense RNA of 1.7 kilobase pairs. It encodes its own nucleoproteins, the delta antigen o~248 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nHDAg, but the outer capsid (HBsAg) of HDV virion is encoded by the genome HBV \\ncoinfecting the same cell. Replication of HDV requires the concomitant expression of HBV \\ngene products, therefore, HBV is necessary for the production of HDV virions. It belongs \\nto the genus Deltavirus. Its mode of transmission is same for HBV. Two types of infection \\nviz coinfection and super infection. In coinfection delta and HBV are transmitted together \\nat the some time. In superinfection delta infection occurring in a person already harbouring \\nHBV. Coinfection clinically presents mild to fulminant disease super infection leads to \\nserious and chronic illness. \\nPathogenesis \\nHOV is transmitted principally by blood and blood products, but also by sexual \\ncontact. Vertical transmission is also possible. \\nTwo types of HDV infections are possible: \\n1. Simultaneous coinfection with HBV & HDV in the same inoculum. It most \\ncommonly results from parenteral transmission, for example, in intravenous drug users. \\nThe clinical and biochemical features of such infection resemble those of actue hepatitis \\nB alone. However, coinfection with HBV and HDV may be more severe than the disease \\ncaused by HBV alone. \\n2. Superinfection of an HBsAg carrier by HDV. It is commoner and more serious \\nbecause a large number of hepatocytes are already producing HBsAg, and HDV can \\nreplicate without delay with a relatively short incubation period. It leads to severe liver \\ndamage, fulminant HBsAg positive hepatitis and elevated mortality (upto 20%) \\nIn simultaneous acute HBV & HDV infections, IgM anti-HBc will be detectable, while \\nin acute HDV infection superimposed on chronic HBV infections, anti-HBc will be of IgG \\nclass. \\nLaboratory Diagnosis \\nIn patients with HBV-HOV coinfections, shortly before tlle end of incubation period, \\nHBsAg appears in the serum and towards the end of incubation period HDAg appears \\nwhich can be detected by ELISA or immunoblotting and HDA RNA can be detected by \\nhybridization to a radio labeled RNA probe. In the later stages of \\nacute disease, anti-HD IgM appears followed by anti-HDIgG. These can be detected by \\nELISA. \\nProphylaxis \\nHDV infection can be prevented by prevention of coinfection witll HBV or of \\nsuperinfection of HBV carriers and hence requires all the measures that apply to the \\nprevention of HBV infection, including vaccination against HBV, HOV vaccine might be \\nof use in patients chronically infected with HBV. \\nHepatitis E Virus (HEV) \\nHepatitis E virus belongs to the family CaIiciviridae. Virions of HEV are spherical,THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 249 \\nnon enveloped and 27-38 run in diameter. They possess single-stranded positive sense \\nRNA genome of 7.6 kb which is surrounded by icosahedral capsid with characteristic \\nsurface depressions. HEV is a spherical non enveloped virus, 32-34 run in diameter with \\nsingle stranded RNA genome. The surface of virion shows indentation and spikes. The \\nvirus is very labile. \\nPathogenesis \\nA substantial proportion of cases of acute viral hepatitis occurring in young to \\nmiddle-aged adults in Asia and the Indian subcontinent appear to be caused by HEV. \\nHepatitis E has been shown to occur in epidemics, endemics and sporadic forms almost \\nexclusively in the less developed parts of the world. It is primarily associated with \\ningestion of faecally contaminated drinking water. It was first documented in New Delhi, \\nIndia, in 1955, when 29,000 cases of icteric hepatitis were identified following widespread \\nfaecal contamination of the city\\'s drinking water. A similar epidemic of hepatitis E \\noccurred between December 1975 and January 1976 in Ahmedabad city, India, again due \\nto contaminated water supplies. Many similar water-borne outbreaks have been recorded \\nsubsequently from Indian subcontinent (Nepal and Pakistan), Southeast Asia (Burma and \\nIndonesia), Central Asis (Kirgiz Republic and China), Africa (Algeria, Ivory coast, Chad, \\nSudan & Somalia) and North America (Mexico). \\nIncubation period of hepatitis E ranges from 2-8 weeks, with an average of 5-6 weeks. \\nIt occurs predominantly in the 15-40 years age group. Clinically, the disease closely \\nresembles that of hepatitis A. however, bilirubin levels tend to be higher and jaundice \\ndeeper and more prolonged. The case-fatality rate is 0.5-3% but in infected pregnant \\nwomen it varies from 10-20%. Like hepatitis A, hepatitis E does not progress to chronic \\nhepatitis, cirrhosis, cancer or carrier state. In contrast to HA V, HEV has considerable \\nimplications in pregnancy. It may cause intrauterine and perinatal infections. HEV \\ninfection during pregnancy may cause a high rate of abortion and intrauterine death and \\nincrease perinatal mortality in babies born to women with fulminant hepatitis. \\nProphylaxis \\nHepatitis E can be prevented by improved standards of sanitation and provision \\nof chlorinated water throughout the developing world. During the epidemic, take boiled \\nwater and only cooked food. No vaccine or effective antiviral drugs exist. \\nHepatitis G Virus (HGV) \\nHepatitis G virus represents a newly discovered virus. It has been proposed that \\nhepatitis C and G should be placed in a separate genus of the family Flaviviridae to be \\ncalled Hepacivirus. HGV is distinct from HCV and newly discovered GBV-A and GBV\\xad\\nB agents, however, GBV-C represents an isolate of HGV. Both the GBV-A and GBV-B \\nviruses are considered animal viruses while HGV jGBV-C has been found in humans and \\nin experimentally infected animals. HGV was cloned from the serum of a patient suffering \\nfrom chronic hepatitis who had a history of parenteral exposure. He was negative for \\nHBV and initially also negative for HCV, but later on was found to have an HCV variant250 TEXT BOOK ,OF MICROBIOLOGY \\ngenotype IV. In order to identify the new virus, nucleic acid from the plasma of the patient \\nwas first amplified using a modified polymerase chain reaction and then cloned into an \\nexpression vector. The recognition of the clone producing viral antigen was done by \\nimmunological methods. \\nThe genome of HGV consists of 9.4 kb molecule of ssRNA of positive polarity. Its \\nstructure resembles that of HCV, but it has <25% homology with HCV. HGV replicates \\nin peripheral blood cells, however, its replication in the liver is not known. The virus \\nis transmitted parentally (exposure to blood through transfusions, haemodialysis, or \\nsharing equipment in injecting drugs use), sexually and for mother to child. More than \\n30% of transfusion recipients and upto 80% of injecting drugs users are HGV marker \\npositive. HGV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) share same infection routes, and \\na significant proportion of HIV-infected subjects are HGV-coinfected. \\nThe virus is present worldwide. Majority of the individuals with HGV infection have \\nno detectable evidence of liver disease. There have been, however, cases of acute, fulminant \\nand chronic hepatitis where HGV is presently the only explanation for their liver disease. \\nThere is no evidence of a causal relationship between HGV infection .and hepatocellular \\ncarcinoma. HGV infection results frequently in chronic viraemia. It often subsides after \\nseveral years and anti-HGenv antibody develops. \\nHGV infection is mainly detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction \\n(RT-PCR). Recently, an immunoassay has been developed to detect anti-HGenv, Serum \\nHGV RNA indicates viraemia, whereas anti-HGenv is associated with recovery. These \\ncan be found respectively in <2 % and 9% of healthy blood donors. Prevalence increases \\nin association with HCV or HBV infection. HGV infection can be prevented by employing \\nthe same measures as for HBV, HCV and HIV. \\n000ARCHAEA \\nThe term Archaea (Greek archaios = ancient) is a group of prokaryotes which is \\nquite different from Eubacteria in several morphological and biochemical traits. The \\narchaebacteria are not a homogenous group but is a collection of disparate phenotypes: \\nthe methanogens, the extreme halophiles (organism that can grow in concentrated salt \\nsolutions) and extreme thermophilic sulphur metabolizing species. \\nMorphologically it canbe spherical, rod-shaped, spiraL lobed, plate shaped, irregularly \\nshaped or pleomorphic. Some are single celled, whereas other form filaments or \\naggregates. They range in diameter from 0.1 to 151-lm and some can grow in 200l-lm \\nin length. \\nArchaea are generally found in extreme aquatic and terrestrial habitats. They are \\noften present in anaerobic, hypersaline or high-temperature environments and also in \\ncold environments. Archaea constitute upto 34% of prokaryotic biomass in Costal \\nAntarctic surface waters and few as a syptbiont in animal digestive systems. \\nPHYLOGENY \\nPhylogenetically the domain Archaea tree splits into two major phyla called the \\nCrenarchaeota and Euryarchaecota. Two other phyla called Korarchaeota and \\nNanoarchaeota branch of close to the root. Phyla Crenarchaeota contain mostly \\nhyper thermophilic species whose optimum growth temperature is greater than BODe. \\nThese hyperthermophiles are chemolithotrophic autotrophs and these organisms are, \\nthe only primary producers in these harsh environments. The 165 rRNA sequencing \\nsuggest that these organisms are more slowly evolving than other lineages in the \\ndomain. \\nPhyla Euryarchaeota includes methanogenic Archaea-whose metabolism is linked252 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLQG¥ \\nto the production of methane (CH 4) and extreme halophiles.

Sometimes they are found in extreme cold environments. \\nThe extreme environment conditions include high temperature, low temperature, \\nlow acidic pH value, high alkaline value, high salt concentration, low water \\navailability, high irradiation which include hot springs, salt lakes, antarctic \\ndesert soils. \\n(3) They are Gram positive or Gram negative and may be spherical, rod shaped, \\nlobed, spiral or plate like or pleomorphic. The size ranges from 0.1-15 J.Ull. \\n(4) They multiply by binary fission, budding, fragmentation or other mechanisms. \\n(5) Nutritionally they are either aerobic, facultative anaerobic or strictly anaerobic, \\nchemolithoautotroph to organotrophs. The autotroph has the ability to fix CO 2 \\nby reverse TCA cycle or by reductive acetyl CoA pathway-leading to \\nproduction of glucose via pyruvate. \\n(6) The Gram positive forms have a thick wall made up of N-acetylglucosamine \\nand L-amino acids while N-acetyl muramic acid and D-amino acids are absent \\nand hence they are resistant to lysozyme and penicillin. The Gram negative254 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\narchaebacteria have a relatively thick protein or glycoprotein cell wall but the \\nouter membrane is absent. \\n(7) The plasma membrane of archaea differs from that of eubacteria and \\neukaryote in having branched chain hydrocarbon attached to glycerol, \\nconnected by ether links (not straight chain fatty acids connected by ester \\nlinks as in eubacteria). \\n(8) The archaebacterial chromosome is a single circular DNA molecule as in \\neubacteria but smaller in length (mol. weight of 0.8 to 1.1 x 109 daltons, \\ncompared to 2.5 x 109 dalton). \\n(9) The T \\\\jI C arm of archaeal tRNA lacks thymine and contains pseudouridine \\nor 1-methyl pseudouridine. \\n(10) The first amino acid to initiate a new polypeptide chain is methionine in \\narchaeobacteria where as it is N-formylmethionine in eubacteria. \\n(11) The eubacteria are sensitive to chloramphenicol while the archaebacteria are \\nnot. While the diphtheria toxin affects archaebacteria but not eubacteria. \\n(12) The variation in G + C content is great (21-68% of molecular weight) \\n(13) The archaeobacteria have few plasmids. \\n(14) The archaebacterial mRNA is more similar to eubacteria than to eukaryotic \\nmRNA. \\n(15) Some methanogens have histone like protein that bends with DNA to form \\nnucleosome like structure. \\n(16) The archaebacteria, specially methanogens contain unusual coenzymes which \\ndo not occur in eubacteria like coenzyme F420, F430, Methanofuran, \\nMethanopterin, and co-enzyme -M. \\n(17) The extreme halophiles are only photosynthetic archaebacteria and convert \\nlight energy into chemical energy by means of a proton pump based on a \\npigment bacteriorhodopsin. \\nTHE ARCHAEBACTERIAL CELL WALL \\nAs we know that archaebacteria are either Gram + ve or Gram -ve. Thus there \\nis considerable variety in the cell wall of archaebacteria. The cell wall structurally and \\nchemically differ from that of eubacteria. The Gram positive archaebacteria have a single \\nuniform thick homogenous cell wall layer like of eubacteria while the gram negative \\narchaebacteria lack the outer membrane and complex peptidoglycan network like that \\nof Gram negative eubacteria. \\nChemically the archaebacterial cell wall differ from eubacteria. They do not contain \\nmuramic acid and D-amino acid (characteristic feature of eubacterial peptidoglycan) but \\ncontain NAG (N-acetyl glucosamine) and L-amino acid. Some methanogens like \\nMethanobacterium contain a peptidoglyan like material called pseudopeptidoglycan or \\npseudomurin which contains an alternating repeats of N-acetyl glucosamine and N\\xad\\nacetyltalosamino uronic acid (unique to archaebacteria) which has L-amino acids in itsARCHAEA 255 \\ncross links and 13 (1-3) glycosidic bonds instead of 13 (1-4) glycosidic bonds. Because \\nof their structural difference the cell walls of archaebacteria are resistant to the action \\nof lysozyme. \\nMethanosarcina sps. contain a complex polysaccharide the major sugar in this being \\ngalactosamine, glucuronic acid and glucose. Halococcus an extreme halophile contains \\na sulphated polysaccharide made of sugars glucose, mannose and galactose. Along with \\nthis a great amount of negatively charged acidic amino acids which serve to balance \\nthe abundance of positive charges generated by the high concentration of sodium in \\nthe organism\\'s environment (about 20-25% NaCl). \\nMethanococcus and Methanomicrobium lack carbohydrates in the cell walls and \\ncontain only protein. Sulfolobus cell walls are made of glycoprotein and can remain, intact \\nin boiling detergent solutions. The cell wall of Pyrodictium (which can with stand 110°C \\nthe most thermophilic organism) is also made of glycoprotein. \\nIn the Gram negative archaebacteria the outer membrane is absent and have a \\nrelatively thick protein and glycoprotein outside the plasma membrane. The layer is \\n20- 40 nm. The chemical content varies considerably some methanogens, Halobacterium \\nand several extreme thermophiles viz. Sulfolobus, Thenlloproteus have glycoproteins in \\ntheir walls. In contrast, other methanogens Methanococcus, Methallomicrobium and \\nDesuifurococcus have protein walls. \\nARCHAEBACfERIAL LIPIDS AND MEMBRANE \\nThe plasma membrane of archaebacteria differs from that of eubacteria and \\neukaryotes. The plasma membrane lipids of archaebacteria have branched chain \\nhydrocarbon attached to glycerol by ether links rather than fatty acid connected by ester \\nlinks as in eubacteria. Sometimes two glycerol groups are linked to form an extremely \\nlong tetraethers. Glycerol diethers and glycerol tetraethers are major classes of lipid \\npresent in archaebacteria. \\nThe lipids are polar lipids which are present in archaebacterial membrane like \\nphospholipids, sulfolipids and glycolipids. About 7-30% of membrane lipids are nonpolar \\nlipids (the derivative of squalene). The C 20 diethers can be used to make a regular bilayer \\nmembrane while a more rigid monolayer membrane is constructed of C 40 tetraethers \\nlipids which increases the membrane\\'s mechanical strength and resistance to chemical \\nagent. \\nIn thermoacidophiles one or two cyclopentane ring commonly occurs in C 40 chains \\nand two-OH (adjacent) groups on glycerol moiety are ether linked to these hydrocarbon \\nchains. Thus archaebacterial membranes may contain a mix of diethers, tetraethers and \\nother lipids like thermoacidophiles contain many dibiphytanyl tetraethers, halophiles \\ncontain many diphytanyl diethers and methanagens contain both diphytanyl diethers \\nand dibiphytanyl tetra ethers. The presence of ether linked lipid is such a unique \\ncharacteristic of archaebacteria that this distinctive feature has been used as a biomarker \\nfor detecting archaebacteria in paleontological studies of rocks, sediments cores and other \\nfossil materials.256 \\n(A) \\n(B) \\nTEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nGlycerol Fatty acids \\nr--------------------------------------~ 10 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 \\n: III \\'\\\\1 \\'\\\\ I \\'\\\\ I \\'\\\\ I \\'\\\\1 \\'\\\\1 \\'\\\\1 \\'\\\\1 \\nH2C-0~C CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 \\n:0 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 \\n: III \\'\\\\1 \\'\\\\ I \\'\\\\ I ,\\\\1 \\\\1 \\\\1 ,\\\\1 \\'\\\\1 \\nHC-OrC CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 \\nt---------------------------------10 \\nI II \\nI \\n~C-OTP-O-R \\nI I \\nL----JO \\nGlycerol Fatty acids \\n~----.------------------------------~ I CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 \\nI I I I I I \\nI H 2C-0..1.CH2 CH CH 2 CH CH 2 CH CH 2 CH \\n: \\'\\\\1\\\\1\\\\1\\\\1\\'\\\\1\\\\1\\\\1\\\\ \\nI CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 \\nCH 3 CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 \\nI I I I \\nHC-0.LCH 2 CH CH 2 CH CH 2 CH CH 2 CH \\n: \\'\\\\1 \\\\1 \\'\\\\1 \\\\1 \\'\\\\1 \\\\1 \\'\\\\1 \\\\ \\nI CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 \\n~------------------------------\\n10 \\nIII \\nI \\nHC-OTP-O-R \\n2 I I \\nL ____ JO \\nFig. 3 : Structure of membrane lipids.

The second edition of \\nBergey\\'s Manual divides the archaea into two phyla the Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota \\neach with several orders. The classification was based on rRNA data. The term \\nCrenarchaeota [Greek Crene, spring or fount and archaeos) and Euryarchaeota [Greek \\nEurus wide and = archaios = ancient or primitive) divided the archaea at the phyla \\nlevel. The Crenarchaeote are thought to resemble the ancestor of the archaea and almost \\nall the species are thermophiles or hyperthermophiles. The phylum Crenarchaeota is \\ndivided into one class. Thermoprotei and four order Thermoproteales, Sulfolobales, \\nDesulfurococcales and Calidisphaerales. \\nThermoproteales contains Gram-ve, anaerobic to facultative hyperthermophilic rods. \\nThey often grow chemolithoautotrophically by reducing sulphur to hydrogen sulfide. \\nMembers of the order Sulfolobales are coccus shaped thermoacidophiles. The order \\nDesulfurococcales contain Gram negative coccoid or disk shaped hyperthermophiles. \\nThey grow either chemolithotrophically by hydrogen oxidation or organotrophically by \\neither fermentation or respiration with sulphur as the electron acceptor. \\nThe Euryarchaeotes are given the name because they occupy different ecological \\nniches and have a variety of metabolic patterns. This phylum is very diverse with seven \\nclasses. (Methanobacteria, Methanococci, Halobacteria, Thermoplasmata, Thermococci, \\nArchaeglobi and Methanopyri), nine orders and 15 families. Methanogens are the \\ndominant physiological group and largest group with a great practical importance \\nbecause methane is a clean burning fuel and an excellent energy source. \\nPHYLUM-CRENARCHAEOTA \\nMost of the Crenarchaeotes are extremely thermophilic and many are acidophilic \\nand sulphur dependent. Almost all are strict anaerobes. They grow in geothermally \\nheated water or soils that contain elemental sulphur. The sulphur may be used either \\nas an electron acceptor in aerobic respiration or as an e- source by lithotrophs. The \\nmembers are scattered all over the world for ego the sulphur rich hot springs in \\nYellowstone National park, Wyoming and water surrounding areas of submarine \\nvolcanic activity. Such habitats are called Solfatara. These archaea can be very \\nthermophilic and often are classified as hyperthermophiles. The phylum include a single \\nclass Thermoprotei, with 4 orders, Thermoproteales, Calidisphaerales, Desulfurococales \\nand Sulfoiobaies. \\nThermoproteus the member of order Thermoproteales is a long thin rod that can \\nbe bent or branched. Its cell wall is composed of glycoprotein. It is strict anaerobic and \\ngrows at temperature from 70-97°C and pH values between 2.5 to 6.5. It is found in \\nhot springs and other hot aquatic habitats rich in sulfur. It can grow organotrophically \\nand oxidize glucose, amino acids, alcohols and organic acids with elemental sulfur as \\nthe electron acceptor. CO or CO 2 act as sole carbon source. \\nSulfolobus is a facultative chemoautotroph found extensively all over the world in \\nhot acid springs and soils. The cells are irregularly lobate spherical.

Although \\nit can grow on organic compounds (organotrophically) but in its natural habitats it \\nprobably grows as a respiratOlY chemoautotroph. Geothermal steam or hot water leaches \\nmuch amounts of iron and sulphide which is rapidly oxidized to elemental sulphur \\nby oxygen or ferric ion, either chemically or biologically: This bacterium rapidly oxidizes \\nH 2S. This ability of Sulfolobus to oxidize Fe+2 to Fe+3 anaerobically has been used quite \\nsuccessfully in high temperature bioleaching of iron and copper ores. Sulfolobus cells \\nare spherical, Gram - ve, aerobic irregulary lobed and cell walls are mainly composed \\nof protein. Cells adhere tightly to sulphur crystals where they can be visualized \\nmicroscopically using fluorescent dyes. Their cell wall contains lipoprotein and \\ncarbohydrate but lacks peptidoglycan. Oxygen is the normal electron acceptor. Sugar \\nand amino acid such as glutamate also serve as carbon and energy sources. They are \\ngenerally classified as thermoacidophiles. \\nPyrodictium: It is a sub-marine volcanic extreme thermophile which is of great \\ninterest because of its ability to grow at temperature upto 110°C (Optimum 105°C). Cells \\nof Pyrodictium are irregularly disc-shaped and grow in cultures as a mold like layer \\nupon sulphur crystals on the medium. The cell mass consists of a network of fibres \\nto which cells are attached. The fibres are hollow and consist of proteinaceous subunits \\nsimilar to that of flagellin protein of eubacterial flagellum. It is strict anaerobe that grows \\nlithotrophically on H2 and S at 82-110°C. The cell envelope consists of glycoprotein. \\nPicrophilus: The genus was isolated from moderately hot solfataric fields in Japan. \\nIt lacks a regular cell wall but has an S-layer outside its plasma membrane. The cells \\ngrows as irregularly shaped cocci, 1.5 flm in diameter and have large cytoplasmic cavities \\nthat are not membrane bounded. The genus is aerobic and grows between 47-65°C. The \\noptimum pH is 0.7 \\nPhylum-Euryarchaeota \\nThis phylum is very diverse phylum with many classes (nine according to 2nd \\nedition of Bergey\\'s manual), viz. Methanobacteria, Methanococci, Methanomicrobia, \\nHalobacteria, Thermoplasmata, Thermococci, Archaeoglobi, Methanopyri. \\nMethanogens occur in various anaerobic habitats rich in organic matter with non\\xad\\nmethanogenic bacteria ferment to produce H2 and CO 2, Thus the methanogens form \\nthe consortia in association with other microorganisms which not only provide CO 2 and \\nfatty acids required. The habitat like marshes, swamps, pond and lake mud marine \\nsediments, the intestinal tract of human and animals, the rumen of cattle and anaerobic \\nsludge digesters in sewage treatment systems are ideal for these archaebacteria. These \\nmicrobes are unable to use carbohydrate, proteins or other complex organic substrates. \\nThe methanogens obtain energy by converting CO 2, H 2, formate, methanol, acetate \\nand other compounds to produce either methane or CO 2, This is the largest group of \\narchaea which differ greatly in overall shape, 16srRNA sequence, cell wall chemistry \\nand structure, membrane lipids. For example methanogens construct three different types \\nof cell wall. The most complex is that of group I which is rigid and composed chiefly \\nof pseudomurin (it contain N-acetyl talosaminuronic acid instead of N-acetylmuramicARCHAEA 261 \\nacid and lack D-amino acids). In appearance the wall resembles those of Gram + ve \\neubacteria. In groupes II the wall is flexible and composed chiefly of proteins with traces \\nof glucosamine. While the group III has the most complex cell wall. It is flexible \\ncomposed of at least two layers, an inner electron dense of unknown chemistry and \\nouter one appearing like a membrane in cross section but composed entirely of protein. \\nThe order Methanobacteriales consists of the genera Methanobacterium, \\nMetJumobrevibacter, Metlumosphaera and Methanothennus. The Methanomicrobiales contains \\nsarcinoid forms and some spirilla. The sarcinae can utilize acetate and sometimes methyl \\namines for methane production. They contain cytochrome b or c or both. The most \\nunusual methanogenic group is the genus Methallopyrus which is extremely thermophilic, \\nrod shaped methanogen from marine hydrothermal vent. This genus occupies the deepest \\nand most ancient branch of euryarchaeotes. \\nThe metabolism of these methanogen is unusual. They contain unique cofactors \\ntetrahydromethanopterin, methanofuran, coenzyme M (all three not found in eubacteria) \\ncoenzyme F 420\\' and coenzyme F 430\\' It is suggested that A TP synthesis is linked with \\nmethanogenesis by electron transport, protein pumping and a chemiosmotic mechanism. \\nThe group methanogenic archaea are potentially of great practical importance \\nbecause methane is a clean burning fuel and an excellent energy source. The sewage \\ntreatment plants uses the methane, produced as a source of energy for heat and \\nelectricity . \\nIn contrast the methanogenesis can also be a ecological problem. It absorb IR \\nradiation and is a green house gas and this significantly promote future global warming. \\nHalobacteria \\nThe extreme halophiles or halobacteria (class Halobacteria) is another group of \\narchaea, currently with 15 genera. It has a single family Halobacteriaceae. They are \\naerobic chemoheterotrophs and require complex nutrients usually proteins and amino \\nacids for growth. All the members of this family are obligate halophiles growing in \\nmedia containing at least 15% NaCl. These members are found in the ecosystem which \\nhave extremely high NaCl concentration like salt lakes, the dead sea and salt preserved \\nfoods. The salt lakes occur in arid regions where evaporation exceeds fresh water inflow, \\nor a lake which is fed by a salt spring. The cell wall of these organism is so dependent \\non the presence of NaCl that it disintegrate when NaCl concentration drops to about \\n1.5 M. The cell wall of HalococclIs are composed of a complex heteropolysaccharide which \\nis stable even at low salt concentration. The major component of cell wall of Halobacterium \\nis a large acidic glycol protein. Its glycan component consist of 22-24 disaccharide linked \\nvia - 0 - glycosidic bond to threionine residues, 12-14 trisaccharide. Also o-li:lked to \\nthrionine and a single heterooligosaccharide in N-glycosidic linkage to aspargine. In \\naddition to the glycoprotein the cell envelope contains nonglycosylated protein and \\nglycolipid. They can also grow in food products such as salted fish and cause spoilage. \\nThey can reach such high population levels that salts lakes, salterns and salted fish \\nactually turn red. The best studied member of the family is Halobacterium salinarium \\nwhich is especial because it can trap light energy photosynthetically with the help of262 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\na special pigment called bacteriorhodopsin. Bacteriorhodopsin is a protein pigment, \\nbecause . of its functional similarity to the visual pigment of eye called rhodopsin, \\nconjugated to bacteriorhodopsin is a molecule of retinal, a carotene like molecule which \\ncan absorb light and catalyse the transfer of protons across the cytoplasmic membrane. \\nThe cell membrane of Halobacterium appears purple due to the presence of the pigment \\nbacteriorhodopsin. When a cell containing the pigment are exposed to light the pigment \\nbleaches. During this bleaching H+ (protons) are extruded to the outside of the membrane \\nand generate a proton motive force which drives ATP synthesis. The absorption spectra \\nof bacteriorhodopsin appears at 570 nm. The Halobacteria also contain cytochrome and \\nferredoxins. The genus Halobacterium has four rhodopsins each with separate function. \\nHalorhodopsin uses light energy to transport chloride ions into the cell and maintain \\na 4-5 M intracellular KCI concentration. Two other rhodopsin act as photoreceptor one \\nfor red and one for blue light. \\nThe halobacteria are Gram negative with the shape ranges from rod to disc shaped, \\npolarly flagellated cells viz. Halobacterium or immotile cocci (Halococcus). The colonies \\nare red to orange in colour because of carotene like pigments. \\nThe genome of Halobacteriwn and Halococcus contain two components with different \\npercentage of G + C values. Majority of DNA has a G + C content of 66-68%. The \\ntotal genome size of Halobacterium is 2.5 x 109 which contains a large number of different \\nrepeated sequences upto 5,000 bp in length. \\nThe group thermococcales are strictly anaerobic and can reduce sulfur to sulfide. \\nThey are motile and have optimum growth temperature 88-100°C. It contains two genera \\nThermococcus and Pyrococcus. This group is also known as extremely thermophilic SO \\nmetabolizers. \\nThe group Archaeoglobales has a single family with single genus Arcllaeoglobus. \\nThis group is also known as sulfate reducing archaea. The organism is Gram -ve, \\nirregular coccoid. Cells with cell wall containing glycoprotein subunits. It can extract \\nelectron from a variety of electron donars (like H 2, lactate, glucose) and reduce sulfate, \\nsulfite or thiosulfate to sulfide. The species is extremely thermophilic (optimum 83°C). \\nIt possess the methanogen, coenzyme F420 and methanopterin. \\nEVOLUTION \\nEvolutionarily all the organism of the group archaea is assumed to be descendent \\nfrom a common ancestor the progenote (the organism might be primitive, cellular, with \\nrudimentary not well coordinated translation apparatus or might be an archae bacterium). \\nAs a group they are collection of diverse groups of organism. The unifying feature being \\ntheir adaptation to extremes of environmental conditions like extreme pH, temperature, \\nsalinity. Considering that early earth had such extreme environmental condition \\narchaebacteria appears to be the early forms of life on earth. It is suggested that \\narchaebacteria are more primitive than eubacteria and evolved at slower rate than both \\ni.e. the eubacteria and eukaryotes. \\nDODMYCOPLASMA \\nIn living organisms, some diseases are caused by very small microorganism called \\nMycoplasma. These organism are the smallest free living cell known much similar to \\nother microorganism like bacteria, chlamydea, rickettsia and viruses. \\nMycoplasmas and prokaryotes, without cell wall have been placed under the class \\nmollicutes (Latin mollis = soft, pliable + cutis = stain) and the order Mycoplasmatales. \\nMycoplasmas or mollicutes (soft skin) are without cell wall and are \\'bounded by triple \\nlayered membrane. They are smallest microorganism which have been known to cause \\na number of diseases in animals and human being. Louis Pasteur first noticed them \\nwhile observing the causative agent of pleuropneumonia in culture. He was unable to \\nisolate them in a pure culture medium. Nocard and Roux (1898) of Pasteur\\'s laboratory \\ncultured the microorganism in media containing serum and demonstrated that the \\npleomorphic microbes could produce the \\ndisease in inoculated healthy cattle. These \\nwere pleomorphic and were called PPLO \\n(Pleuropneumonia like organism). This \\norganism was later on given the name \\nAsterococcus mycoides by Borrel et al (1910). \\nNowak (1929) put Asterococcus mycoides \\nunder the genus Mycoplasma. All such \\norganisms are now called mycoplasmas. \\nIn 1967 Japanese scientists Doi, \\nTeranaka, Yora and Asuyama surprised the \\nplant pathologists stated that Mulberry \\ndwarf, Potato witches broom, Aster yellows \\nor Paulownia witches broom which were \\nCell membrane \\n_-..,...DNA \\n~\\'-+--~ Ribosome \\nFig. 1 : Diagrammatic representation of \\nsingle cell of Mycoplasma264 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nsuspected to be the virus diseases, were infact caused by Mycoplasma. In 1976 as many \\nas 150 plant species were known in which Mycoplasmas could be detected. \\nTABLE 1 \\nCharacters of Mycoplasmas and Viruses \\nProperties \\n1. Growth on culture medium \\n2.

They are sensitive to supersonic vibrations \\ndesiccations and most of the physical environment factors. \\n(6) The colony of mycoplasma on solid agar medium appears as just like fried \\negg under stereo microscope. The colony shows spherical or hemispherical portion in \\nthe centre, which is surrounded by stlrface growth towards periphery. The typical colony \\nis biphasic with a fried egg appearance (characterized by opaque, granular central area \\nwith a transleucent peripheral zone). \\n(7) They are susceptible to lysis by osmotic shocks caused by sudden dilution of \\nthe medium with water.MYCOPLASMA 265 \\n(8) They can be cultivated in vitro on non-living media of rich composition as \\nfacultative anaerobes or obligate anaerobes. \\n(9) The genome size of mycoplasmas are about 1/5 to 1/2 thz size of those of \\nbacteria. \\n(10) Genetic material is naked circular chromosome of fibrillar (double stranded) \\nDNA, about 3 nm thick with a molecular weight ranges from 44 x 10 to 1200 x 10 \\ndaItons. Guanine: cytosine ratio of DNA ranges from 24-10%. \\n(11) The mode of multiplication is presumed to be by budding or binary fission. \\n(12) Chemically they are much closer to bacteria because they possess 4% DNA \\nand 8% RNA, 70s ribosomes are present in the cytoplasm. \\n(13) Cells are non-motile but gliding motility has been observed in a few species. \\n(14) Mesosomes are not found in the cells of mycoplasma, but plasm ids are found \\non the basis of dry matter 50-80% proteins, 8-17% RNA and 4-7% DNA is present. \\n(15) They do not show response towards Gram staining i.e. they are Gram negative \\nin nature. Stevens & Fox (1979) suggested a rapid and simple technique called Dien\\'s \\nstain for staining technique. \\n(16) They are insensitive to penicillin, vancomycin and cephaloridine (which effect \\non cell wall) but are sensitive toward tetracycline & chloremphenicol (which effect on \\nmetabolic activities) and they have harmful effect on them. \\nCLASSIFICA nON \\nIn 1966, International Committee of Nomenclature of Bacteria, separated mycoplasma \\nfrom bacteria and placed them in class-Mollicutes. (Mollis = flexible, + cutis = stain). \\nEdward & Friendt (1970) have classified Mycoplasma or PPLO under different groups \\non the basis of sterol requirement. \\nClass - Mollicutes \\nOrder - Mycoplasmatales \\nFamily - includes 3 families \\n(i) Mycoplasmataceae - e.g. Mycoplasma \\n(ii) Acholeplasmataceae - e.g. AcllOleplasma \\n(iii) Spiroplasmataceae - e.g. Spiroplasma \\nCELL STRUCTURE \\nThe ultra structure of cell of Mycoplasma appears as prokaryotic unicellular \\nmicroorganism. The outer most boundary of cell is a unit plasma membrane which is \\nthree layered made up of lipoprotein. The chemical nature of lipoprotein consist of \\nphospholipids and cholesterol. This unit membrane is 80-100Ao in thickness and \\nselectively permeable. The membrane surrounds the cytoplasm which is packed with \\n70s ribosomes, R.N.A., naked circular chromosome of fibrillar double stranded DNA \\nof about 3 nm thick, one or more electron dense areas and some empty vacuoles.266 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nOn the basis of dry weight the chemical composition of Mycoplasma is as follows:\\xad\\nProtein - 50-80% \\nLipid - approx 40% \\nRNA - 8-15% \\nDNA - 4-6% \\nMesosomes are not found in the cells of Mycoplasma but plastnids are found 40 \\ndifferent types of enzymes are found in cytoplasm. \\nBecause the Mycoplasma are able to pass through many filters and grow in media \\nwhich do not contain living tissue. They are therefore considered to be microorganism \\nintermediate between bacteria and viruses chemically they are much closer to bacteria. \\nBecause of their special cell structure and physiology various scientist has named \\nMycoplasmas with different nomenclature viz. Joker of microbiology, jocker of plant \\nkingdom, Prokaryote without cell wall, and Bacteria with their coats off. \\nReproduction \\nMorowitz and Tourtelotte (1962) reported the absence of sexual and asexual \\nreproduction in Mycoplasma, but they reproduce by (i) Fragmentation (ii) Budding (iii) \\nYoung elementary bodies \\nFormation of elementary body is an important mode of reproduction in Mycoplasma. \\nThe cells of Mycoplasma laidlawii show unequal division at the time of multiplication, \\nas a result of which elementary bodies of 330-450 Ilm size are formed. They are very \\nminute and can live freely. They are known as primary bodies. These primary bodies \\nincreases in size and shape accordingly called as secondary and tertiary structures. Inside \\nthese larger bodies the elementary bodies are formed and this stage is known as \\nquarternary structure and after the rupturing of larger bodies these are released and \\nthis quarternary structure develops into complete mycoplasma cell. \\nECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF MYCOPLASMA \\nMycoplasma causes many diseases in plants animals and human beings. The \\nimportant ones, caused in plants are as follows: \\nMycoplasmal Plant Diseases : \\n• Little leaf disease of Brinjal. \\n• Bunchy top of Papaya. \\n• Witches broom of Legumes. \\n• Yellow dwarf of Tobacco. \\n• Sandal spike disease. \\n• Sesamum Phyllody. \\n• Stripe disease of Sugarcane. \\n• Witches broom of Potato.MYCOPLASMA 267 \\n• Clover virescence. \\n• Clover phyllody disease. \\n• Cotton virescence. \\nSymptoms of Mycoplasmal Plant Diseases \\n(i) Plant associated with mycoplasma are infected in the sieve tubes of the plants \\ncauses upsetting the hormonal balance resulting in witchs broom growth (all \\nthe axillary buds grows and convert into bunch). \\n(ii) In some cases flower leaf assume the shape of foliage leaves (phyllody) and \\nvarious intermediate stage between flowers and leafy sprouts can be found \\n(antholysis). In many cases no anthocyanin are formed in petal. \\n(iii) Degenerative processes in the sieve tubes of infected plant causes plant \\nstunting, wilting or leaf yellowing and reduction of leaf size. \\n(iv) Colour breaking in the calyx portion of infected flower causes greening of all \\nflower parts (virescence) and transferred into green leaf like structure (Phyllody). \\n(v) Stem become flat in infected plant. \\n(vi) Excessive callose formation and cell necrosis occurs in the sieve tubes of \\ninfected plant which can be visible under a fluorescence microscope after \\nstaining with aniline blue (serves as indirect indication for the presence of \\nmycoplasma). \\nTransmission of Disease \\n(i) Plant mycoplasmas are known to be transmitted by certain insect vectors (leaf \\nhopper) of cicadellidae and psyllidae. Once mycoplasma invade the insects \\nsalivary glands the vectors can transmit these organisms with the help of their \\nsaliva to healthy plants. \\n(ii) By grafting, mycoplasma can be transferred to healthy plant. \\n(iii) With the aid of Cuscuta, mycoplasma can be transferred from diseased to \\nhealthy plants. (with the help of haustoria) but this type of. transmission does \\nnot occur in nature. \\n(iv) An aphid named Acnjthosiphon pisum transmit mycoplasma in Pisum sativum. \\nMycoplasmal Human Diseases \\n(i) Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes the disease primary atypical pneumonia (PAP) \\nin the mouth, pharynx and genitourinary tract. \\n(ii) Ureaplasma ueralyticum have been found in women experiencing repeated or \\nhabitual reproduction failure. \\n(iii) Two species of mycoplasma viz. M. hominis and M. fermentants has been found \\nresponsible for infertility in men. \\n(iv) M. orale and M. salivarium are found responsible for respiratory tract infection. \\n(v) Mycoplasma have also been found in cases of arthritis and inflammation of \\nthe middle ear.268 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMycoplasmal Animal Diseases: \\n(i) Inflammation of genitals in animals is caused by Mycoplasma bovigenitalillm. \\n(ii) Bovine pleuropneumonia in animals is caused by Mycoplasma mycoides. \\n(iii) Agalactia of sheep and goat is caused by Mycoplasma agalactiae. \\n(iv) Sinubitis in hen is caused by Mycoplasma melegridis. \\nThermoplasmas are heat loving mycoplasma. The optimum temperature for growth \\nis 59°C. They are Gram variable. \\nThe genus Thermoplasma grows at a temperature of 55-59°C (max. 62°q and pH \\n2 (minimum 1 to max. 4). The genus is distinct from other extreme thermophiles as \\nit resembles the eubacterial genus Mycoplasma in lacking a cell wall and forming fried \\negg colony. It grows in refuse piles of coal mines which contain iron pyrites (PeS) which \\noxidized to sulphuric acid by lithotrophs. Thennoplasma lacks a cell wall but cell \\nmembrane contains large amounts of lipopolysaccharide and glycoprotein (diglycerol \\ntetraethers). The DNA is stabilized with a histone like protein, thus resembling the \\nchromosome of eukaryote. \\nSpiroplasma are spiral form mycoplasmas. The helical filamentous forms are motile \\nand show rapid rotary or screw motion and slow undulation motion. They are gram \\npositive. \\nMycoplasma resembles L-form in (i) having similar ultrastructure (ii) soft pleomorphic \\ncells devoid of mucopeptide wall (iii) not osmotically fragile (iv) growth on media \\nwithout osmotic protection. They differ from L-forms in the following characters : (i) \\nwhile the L-forms revert to normal cells when the antibiotic is removed, mycoplasma \\nnever synthesizes the wall and (ii) while L-forms are non-pathogenic, mycoplasmas are \\nimportant pathogens. \\nL- form was isolated by Kleinberger Nobel in 1935. The cells were called L- forms \\nafter Lister Institute in London where they were isolated. L-forms are spheroplast like \\nstructure lacking cell wall. These naked protoplast can also be isolated from Salmonella, \\nE. coli and Proteus (both Gram positive and Gram negative) as well as from other bacteria \\nby cultivation on serum agar with penicillin (100 Ilg/ ml) in laboratory conditions. They \\nproduce fried egg type colonies which resemble those of mycoplasma species. Two types \\nof L-forms have been isolated. \\nThe L-form colonies can be lifted and cultured at higher concentration of penicillin \\nas at lower concentrations the L-forms revert to normal bacterial cells with walls. L \\nforms resemble protoplasts and sphaeroplasts in (a) lack of flagella. (b) inability to \\nsporulate (c) lack of some or all cell wall antigens (d) revers on to normal cells when \\nantibiotic treatment is stopped. \\nThe L-forms do not multiply by binary fission. They increase in size (upto 50Il) \\nand than form large number of small (0.1-0.31l) units called elementary corpuscles by \\nfission or budding. \\nThese similarities suggest that in nature, mycoplasma might have originated from \\nL-forms by loss of the capacity of reversion to normal cells. Thus L-forms are closest \\nto mycoplasma, could be thought of as their proginator. \\n000PHYTOPLASMA \\nPhytoplasmas were earlier known as mycoplasma like organisms (MLOs) because \\nof their similarities with mycoplasmas when observed under electron microscope. These \\nare plant parasitic prokaryotes that lack a cell wall and occur in phloem elements of the \\nshoots. The most common symptoms of affected plants are yellowing, phyllody and \\nwitches\\' broom. In India, these have been reported on citrus and coconut plants. \\nMOLLICUTES \\nPresence of cell wall is the fundamental characteristic of bacteria, absence of wall \\nin certain prokaryotic organisms incited some workers to work out their systematic \\nposition. Nocard and their collaborators first cultured a wall less contagious microbe, \\ncausing pleuropneumonia of cattle, on artificial broth in 1898. They observed small \\ncolonies with dark center and light peripheral area that resembled with fried eggs. Like \\nviruses, these microbes were filterable. Cell wall free and filterable prokaryotes discovered \\nuntil 1930s were named as \"Pleuro-Pneumonia like Organisms\" or \"PPLOs\". \\nIn 1960s, these wall-less prokaryotes were given the collective term \"Mycoplasmas\" \\n(Greek noun mycos meaning fungus and the Greek noun plasma meaning something \\nformed or moulded) since it was proposed that all such similar organisms be assigned \\nto the genus Mycoplasma. This terminology became obsolete when new microorganisms \\nsuch as Acholeplasma and Ureaplasma, etc., were being isolated and characterized. Therefore, \\na revised classification scheme was devised whereby all filterable, wall-less prokaryotes \\nwere covered under a broad system called the class-MoIlicutes (from the Latin adjective \\nmollis meaning pliable and the latin noun cutis meaning skin). \\nMollicutes are the smallest biologically self-replicating cells with their diameter \\nbetween 0.30 /lm and 0.80 /lm. Out of all living organisms, the Mollicutes have s~aIIest \\nreported genomes. The size of their genome is as small as 400 MDa. MoUicutes have270 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nevolved specifically from a branch of the phylogenetic tree containing Gram positive \\nbacteria with an unusually low (23-46%) G + C ratio. Although they are equipped with \\nDNA and RNA for performing protein synthesis, but their limited biosynthetic capabilities \\ncreate a huge dependence on their environment. The pleomorphic characteristics of \\nMollicutes range from coccoid to filamentous form, but often demonstrate the characteristic \\n\"Y\" shape appearance. They are able to pass through 0.45 ~m and 0.22 ~m filters \\ncommonly used in biological sterilization. Mycoplasma was the common term for all cell \\nwall less organisms belonging to the Class-Mollicutes. This class encompasses eight \\ngenera, Spiroplasma, Ureaplasma, Mycoplasma, Ac1lOleplasma, Anaeroplasma, Asteroplasma, \\nElltomoplasma and Mesoplasma. \\nPHYfOPLASMAS \\nMany yellowing diseases of plants were thought to be caused by viruses because \\nof the symptoms and mode of transmission and reproduction of the causative organisms. \\nDoi et al proposed that some yellowing disease could be the result of cell wall less \\nprokaryotes instead of viruses. This idea led to the discovery of pleomorphic, wall free \\nprokaryotic endoparasites residing in the phloem of diseased plants. Cell wall free \\nprokaryotes infecting plants were previously termed as \"Mycoplasma like Organisms\" or \\nII MLOs\" , because of their structural resemblance to mycoplasma. Mycoplasmas cause \\nvarious kinds of disorders in humans and animals and are sensitive to tetracycline and \\npenicillin both, whereas MLOs are sensitive to tetracycline only. In contrast to mycoplasma, \\nthe plant parasitic MLOs cannot be cultured in vitro in cell free media. In the last decade \\nevidences provided by fluorescence and electron microscopy and application of molecular \\ntechniques resolved that MLOs are the mollicutes quite distinct from mycoplasmas. This \\nfinding led to a proposal that the term MLOs be replaced with the generic name of \\nPHYTOPLASMA. \\nPhytoplasmas are the smallest known phloem-limited plant pathogenic unicellular \\nobligate endoparasites. These are bacteria-like prokaryotic organism surrounded by \\nplasma membrane that lack true nucleus and membrane bound organelles. Their mode \\nof multiplication is through binary fission. Phytoplasmas have no characteristic cell wall \\nand have neither been isolated, nor purified, nor cultured on an axenic medium so far. \\nThese are pleomorphic that can stretch and can cross the sieve plates to migrate towards \\nthe roots in autumn and towards the shoot in spring. \\nPhytoplasmas are thought to be evolved from the Gram positive bacteria, they have \\na DNA genome which is A-T rich, some Phytoplasmas have the lowest G-C content (23 \\nto 26.3%) of any living organism. The size of genome of these microbes ranges from 640 \\nto 1185 kb. Phytoplasmas have a long incubation period that can spread as epidemic \\ncausing significant economic damage. Symptoms on infected plants become evident only \\none or two years after infection, when the disease has already spread to other plants. \\nPhytoplasmas are considered to be quarantine organisms in the European Union. \\nTransportation of Phytoplasma infected plants is forbidden even if the specific vector \\nspecies is absent in the importation area.PHYrOPLASMA 271 \\nOccurrence and Maintenance \\nLike mycoplasma, phytoplasmas are organ/ tissue specific. They are found more \\nfrequently in the roots, but can also be found in many places in the plant. Phytoplasmas \\nare obligate endoparasites located inside the cell walls of their hosts, either as extra\\xad\\ncytoplasmic in mature sieve tubes of or as intra-cytoplasmic in young sieve tubes. Since \\nleaf hoppers and plant hoppers are their vectors, therefore, these have been discovered \\nin their body parts also. Phytoplasmas have not yet been grown in vitro on cell free nutrient \\nmedia in the laboratories. All efforts to culture these microorganisms under artificial \\nconditions have been failed. Phytoplasmas are maintained in the host plants. This can \\nbe achieved by tissue culture techniques, by grafting infected twigs on susceptible plants, \\nor by insect transmission. \\nDetection \\nUnlike typical bacteria, phytoplasmas cannot be cultured on artificial media in the \\nlaboratory. However, they can be determined with phytoplasma-specific stains such as \\nDAPI (4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) a nucleic acid stain, which stain bacteria in phloem. \\nDienes\\' stain is metabolized by phytoplasmas that produces blue colour. Healthy phloem \\ndoes not impart colour. Dienes\\' stain is more specific than DAPI. Phytoplasmas are \\ndetected by grafting infected twigs to susceptible host plants such as Periwinkle (Catharallthus \\nroseus). These can also be detected using light or electron microscopy, molecular techniques \\nincluding DNA probes, enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assays (ELISA) and DNA \\namplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). \\nVectors \\nPhytoplasma vector species belong to hemipters that are phloem-feeding insects. \\nThree families Oassidea, Cixidae and Psyllidae) contain the known vector species. It has \\nbeen found that phytoplasmas circulate, multiply and persist in the body of leafhopper \\nvectors. It is considered that phytoplasmas are not transmitted vertically to the progeny \\nof infected specimen. Among plant hoppers, species in the cixiid family are known to \\ntransmit phytoplasma belonging to \"stolbur\" group. Among psyllids, several species have \\nbeen shown to transmit diseases of fruit trees. Leafhoppers, and psyllids are the most \\ncommon vectors of phytoplasma. \\nSpread and Transmission \\nPhytoplasmas are completely dependent on their host for existence, as these as \\nobligate endoparasites. They live in phloem of the plants. Phytoplasmas generally move \\nto a new area by grafting, planting infected cuttings, by parasitic plants such as Dodder \\n(Cuscuta Spp) and by leafhoppers, which migrate annually. Phytoplasmas are phloem\\xad\\nlimited and cannot be transmitted through seeds. It is unlikely that phytoplasmas could \\nsurvive the desiccation usually associated with seed formation. \\nDisease Symptoms \\nSymptoms on plants include virescence (the development of green flowers), phyllody272 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(the development of floral parts into leafy structures), sterility of flowers, proliferation of \\nadventitious or axillary shoots resulting in witches-broom appearance, abnormal elongation \\nof internodes resulting in slender shoots, generalized stunting (eg. small flowers, leaves, \\nshortened internodes), unseasonal discoloration of leaves or shoots (eg. yellowing, purple \\ndiscoloration), leaf curling or cupping, bunchy appearance of growth at the ends of stem, \\nbrownish discoloration of phloem tissues, and generalized decline (stunting, die back of \\ntwigs of trunks, lethal yellowing). \\nDiseases associated with the presence of phytoplasmas in phloem typically exhibit \\nan array of symptoms mentioned above. \\nIdentification \\n(1) Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using polyclonal and monoclonal \\nantiseara; \\n(2) Dot hybridization assay, using cloned phytoplasma DNA and their complementary \\nRNA probes; \\n(3) Southern hybridization assay, by analyzing RELP of part of or total genomic \\nDNA using selected cloned DNA probes, including highly repetitive sequences in the \\ngenome; \\n(4) Polymerase chain rea,ctions (PCR), using primers based on cloned DNA fragments \\nspecific to a given phytoplasma or a subgroup and \\n(5) RELP analysis of DNA sequences with various degrees of conservation, using \\nvarious conserved sequences such as 16s rRNA gene, ribosomal protein, operon, tuf gene \\nand other chromosomal DNA fragments. \\nClassification \\nPhytoplasma diseases were initially classified eiUler on the basis of the symptoms \\n(decline, proliferation and virescence) they develop, or type of plants infected by them, \\nor type of insect vectors (leafhoppers, plant hoppers and psyllids) that transmitted them \\nto the plants. In the previous decade, identification of phytoplasma has been resolved \\nthrough novel techniques of restriction endonuclease digestion of PCR-amplified rDNA \\nproducts, electrophoresis of digests on agarose or polyacrylamide gel, and comparison \\nof resulting fragments with those of known phytoplasmas. In 1993, Lee et al identified \\na total of 16 groups of 16SrDNA on the basis of dissimilarities of restriction sites detected \\nby rDNA RELPs. \\nGarrity et al divided the domain bacteria into 23 phyla of which 13th phylum \\nPirmicutes comprises of three classes (namely Clostridia, Mollicutes and Bacilli). The class\\xad\\nMollicutes, consists of wall less bacteria and has been divided into five orders: the order \\nAcholeplasmatales has a single family Acholeplasmataceae that comprises only two \\ngenera-Acholeplasma and Phytoplasma. \\nDomain: Bacteria (23 phyla) \\nPhylum: Pirmicutes (3 classes)PHYrOPLASMA \\nClass: Mollicutes (4 orders) \\nOrder: Acholeplasmatales (1 family) \\nFamily: Acholeplasmataceae (2 genera) \\nGenus: Phytoplasma \\nPhytoplasma 16SrI \\nPhytoplasma 16SrII \\nPhytoplasma 16SrIII \\nPhytoplasma 16SrIV \\nPhytol\\'lasma 16SrV \\nPhytoplasma 16SrVI \\nPhytoplasma 16SrVII \\nPhytoplasma 16SrVIII \\nPhytoplasma 16SrIX \\nPhytoplasma 16SrX \\nPhytoplasma 16SrXI \\nPhytoplasma 16SrXII \\nPhytoplasma 16SrXIII \\nPhytoplasma 16SrXIV \\nAster yellows group \\nPeanut WB group \\nX-disease group \\nCoconut lethal yellows group \\nElm yellow group \\nClover proliferation group \\nAsh yellows group \\nLoofah witche\\'s-broom group \\nPigeon pea witche\\'s-broom group \\nApple proliferation group \\nRice yellow dwarf group \\nStolbur group \\nMexican Periwinkle virescence group \\nBermuda white leaf group \\nPhytoplasma 16SrXV Hibiscus witche\\'s broom group \\n273 \\nSeemuller et al (1998) described eight more genera which are given below and were \\nnot mentioned in the previous classification AUSGY-Australian Grapevine Yellows.

Phytoplasma infected plants are passed through seed cycle, \\nsince Phytoplasmas are not seed transmitted. Remission of symptoms \\nand curing a plant can be achieved through the application of the antibiotic tetracycline. \\nConventional control methods include sanitary selection, in some cases pruning of \\nbranches of woody plants with localized symptoms, destruction of phytoplasma reservoir \\nplants, monitoring of vector species, thermotherapy, cross protection and genetic selection \\nfor tolerant of resistant varieties. \\nLittle Leaf of Brinjal or Egg Plant \\nLittle leaf of brinjal (Solanum melongena) is found throughout India and other \\nneighbouring countries. This disease was first reported from Coimbatore by Thomas and274 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nKrishnaswami (1939). Almost all brinjal varieties are susceptible to this disease. The \\ndisease is a serious threat for the crop grown. When young plants are attacked they do \\nnot produce flowers and fruits. The disease can cause upto 64% reduction in plant \\nproductivity. The mycoplasma can affect at least 13 plants genera in 5 families include \\ncultivated and wild egg plants, datura, tomato, tobacco etc. \\nSymptoms \\nThe main symptom is production of very short and small leaves. The petioles are \\nso much reduced in size become narrow, soft, smooth and yellowish in colour. Newly \\nformed leaves are further reduced in size. The inter node become shortened and at the \\nsame time large number of axillary buds are stimulated to grow into short branches with \\nsmall leaves. This gives the plant a bushy appearance and plant fail to form flowers and \\neven if flowers are formed they remain green and leaf like. Virescent (a coloured tissue \\nthat develops chloroplast and becomes green), and phylloid flowers (floral coloured parts \\ndevelop chloroplast and become green) is common fruit setting is seldom. \\nVerma et al. (1969) showed that the disease symptoms are associated with MLO\\'s \\n(now phytoplasma). MLB\\'s were described as spherical to ovoid structure (40-300 nm) \\nand were present in the phloem cells of diseased plants. The phytoplasma are also seen \\nin the body organs of vectors. \\nIn nature the causal agent of the disease is transmitted by the leaf hopper vector \\nCestius phycitis and also by Empoasca devastans. Vector acquire MLO\\'s after several days \\nof feeding and transmit MLO\\'s after an incubation period of 10-45 days. The incubation \\nperiod is required for the multiplication and distribution of MLO\\'s in the insect body. \\nDuring the off season of brinjal crop the causal agent survives on weed hosts (Solanum \\nxallthocarpum) and then it is transmitted to the main crop by the insect vectors. Bitter gourd, \\nwater melon, carrot, sunhemp are good hosts of the vector and beet, castor, soybean are \\nsuitable for oviposition. \\nControl \\nNo effective control measures against the pathogen is known. Antibiotic treatment \\nwith tetracycline is reported to control the disease eradication of weed hosts and diseased \\nbrinjal plants and control of insect vectors by insecticide is the only recommendations \\nin India. The Indian variety Brinjal round is tolerant. \\n000GENERAL ACCOUNT OF CYANOBACTERIA \\nThe two divisions of algae contain prokaryotic algae which are now usually called \\nbacteria in view of their cell structure being very similar to eubacteria. Thus cyanophyta \\n(= Cyanophyceae) are called cyanobacteria and Prochlorophyta (= Prochlorophyceae) \\nare termed Prochlorobacteria. \\nThe Division - Cyanophyta (Cyanobacteria) are the blue greens, the most primitive \\nof algal organisms. They have existed on the surface of the earth since the early \\nPrecambrian. Blue green algae are kept under the class myxophycae or cyanophyceae of \\nthe algae division. They are commonly called as blue-green algae due to the presence \\nof water soluble accessory photosynthetic pigments named C-phycocyanin and C\\xad\\nphycoerythrin which impart blue-green colour to the algae. Along with this certain \\ncharacteristics Xanthophylls viz myxoxanthin, and myxoxanthophyll, oscillaxanthin, \\nzeaxanthin are present in addition to chlorophyll -a and 13 - carotene etc. Fritsch (1945) \\nclassified the blue green algae into class myxophycae. He also called this algae as the \\nmembers of class schizophyceae (Schizo = fission) and phycochromophyceae. An eminent \\nIndian phycologist Prof. T.V. Desikachari (1959), Morris (1973) and Round (1973) kept \\nthis algae in Division Cyanophyta but Chapman (1962) gave them a separate name \\nMyxophycophyta. But according to recent trend these members are kept under the \\nmembers of prokaryota and called as cyanobacteria. \\nGENERAL CHARACfERS OF CYANOBACTERIA \\n(1) They have a prokaryotic cell organisation. \\n(2) They lack the membrane bound cell organelles such as chloroplast, mitochondria, \\nE.R., nucleus. They lack definite chromosome however DNA fibrils are present. \\n(3) Photosynthetic pigments include chlorophyll-a, 13- carotene, xanthophylls276 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(lutein and zeaxanthin) and biliproteins (C-phycocyanin and phycoerythrin). \\nNo distinct plastid, the photosynthetic pigments are located on photosynthetic \\nlamellae (thylakoid) generally scattered in the peripheral protoplast. \\n(4) Thallus bears a specialized gliding movement. \\n(5) Reserve food material is cyanophycean starch and cyanophycean granules. \\n(6) According to Fischer (1897) the cytoplasm of cell is divided into two parts \\nthe outer or peripheral chromoplasm and the central colourless centroplasm. \\n(7) Many members of class cyanophyta are involved in nitrogen fixation viz. \\nNostoc, Anabaena, Calotlzrix and Cylindrospermum. \\n(8) All the members of this class screate mucilage and usually possess a mucilage \\nsheath. This muciliage may be yellow, brown, red or purple in colour. \\n(9) Many floating and planktonic algae member of this class bears gas vacuole. \\nFor example in Nostac, Calothrix, Phormidium etc. The gas vacuole provide \\nbuyoancy to the floating algae. \\n(10) Vegetative reproduction is by means of hormogonia, endospore, and nanocytes \\nlike structure. \\n(11) No asexual reproduction is reported. \\n(12) No sexual reproduction. However genetic recombination has been observed \\nin few species ego AnaCljstis nidulans. \\n(13) No motile cells (even the reproductive cells are non motile) and lack flagella. \\nOCCURRENCE \\nBlue-green algae are found in all parts of the world from the tropics to the polar \\nregions, and from the oceans to the top of the mountains. Majority of genera are found \\nboth in fresh as well as in brackish (saltish) water. \\nHigh temperature, intense light and humid environment is required for the growth \\nof thallus. According to Desikachari (1959) about 160 genera and 1500 species are \\nreporated from the tropical areas. In India the members are represented by 85 genera \\nand 750 species. The members of blue green algae are found in hot and humid \\nenvironment, moist or alkaline land, along with this they require high intensity of light. \\nThe members of blue green algae grow extensively in the paddy fields of tropical and \\ntemperate climate region eg-Anabaena, Nostoc, Tolypothrix, and Cylindrospermum grow \\nactivily and fix atmospheric nitrogen. \\nSome members of cyanobacteria are found in fresh water lakes, ponds and various \\ntypes of water reservoirs. Many members grow extensively on the surface of fresh water \\nand form water blooms. eg-MicrOCljstis and Arthospira. Such algae growth emit bad odour \\nand render water obnoxious and undrinkable. \\nSome blue green algae when abundant, may also impart their colour to water. For \\nego Trichodesmium erythraeum is responsible for red colour of the red sea. The red colour \\nis due to the presence of red pigments in the cell, and the extensive growth of this \\nalgae impart the expression of red coloured water of the sea.GENERAL ACCOUNT OF CYANOBACTERIA 277 \\nSome blue green algae live symbiotically with different organisms, ex- Anabaena \\nand Nostoc in Anthoceros (Bryophyta) thallus and Anabaena in Cycas (corolloid) root. Some \\nmembers live with fungi forming lichens. A few blue green algae ego Oscillospira and \\nAnabaeniolum live endozoically (growing inside animals) in the digestive tract of \\nmammals, including man, while some others live in unicellular animals. \\nMembers of cyanophyceae are pioneer colonizers (first inha.bitant) of bare rocks \\nand virgin lands. They also grow on alkaline or saline soils. \\nFollowing are the examples of blue green algae found in various habitat: \\n1. Fresh water ponds and lakes - Anabaena, Oscillatoria, Rivularia, and Cytonea. \\n2. In sea water - Trichodesmium and Dermocarpus. \\n3. In moist land - Anabaena, Nostoc. \\n4. Hot water springs - Phormidium and MicrOC1jstis. \\n5. As an endophyte - Gleocapsa and Anabaena. \\n6. In the intestine of man - Semollcela and Oscillatoria. \\n7. Limestone rocks - Gleocapsa salina and Calothrix peritina. \\nB. Lichen-Gleocapsa, Nostoc, SC1jtonema, Stigonema. \\n9. Hot water springs (temp. 70-75°C) Mastigocladus and Phonllidium. \\nTHALLUS ORGANIZATION \\nThe thallus ranges from unicellular to coenobial and filamentous forms. Filamentous \\nforms may be unbranched or branched, heterotrichous or even pseudo parenchymatous. \\nArchitecturally the thallus may be a solitary cell or a colony. \\n(1) Unicellular: The thallus is a unicell which may be spherical or oval eg\\xad\\nChroococcus, Synechococcus and Gloeocapsa. Actual unicellular forms however are not many \\nbecause the copious secretion of mucilage by the daughter cells results in the daughter \\ncells, remaining together after division. \\n(2) Colonial forms: In cyanobacteria the cells after division remain attached by \\ntheir walls or are held in a common gelatinous matrix to form a loose organisation \\nof cells which is termed as a colony. The colony is of two types: \\n(a) Palmelloid: The thallus structure resembles the algae Palmella eg- Microcystis \\nand Gleocapsa. \\n(b) Dendroid: The thallus is found in Chamaesiphon. \\n(3) Filamentous: The cells are arranged end to end in a row which is a result of \\nrepeated cell divisions in a single plane and in a single direction forming a chain or \\na thread. It is known as the trichome. The trichome together with its mucilaginous sheath \\nis called a filament. In most cases a single filament has a single trichome, but in some \\ncases more than one trichome may occur within the common sheath. The cells of trichome \\nmay show little or no differentiation into base and apex ex. : Oscillatoria or it may have \\na broad base while its apex tapers to a hair like structure. Ex- Rivularia.278 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe trichomes of some members are \\'homocystous\\' i.e. made up of uniform cells \\ne.g. Oscillatoria but trichomes of majority of algae are \\'heterocystous\\' i.e. it contain some \\nspecial cells called \\'heterocyst\\' at one or both ends or at regular intervals along their \\nlength ego Rivularia. \\nTrichomes may be branched or unbranched: \\n(a) Unbranched: Trichomes are unbranched (simple) in some members (e.g. \\nAnabaena, Nostoc, Oscillatoria) simple trichomes may be either free floating (e.g. Spirulina) \\nor aggregated into colonies (eg. Anabaena and Nostoc). Some time unbranched trichomes \\nshow false branching (eg. Scytonema). A cell of a trichome dies and one or both ends \\nof the trichome at the point of the dead cell grow out as false branches. \\n(b) Branched: Trichome are of the following three types:-\\nMicrocystis Aphanocapsa \\n(8) \\n\\'.; .. ::: .... -:i--------I!~~:~ \\':.\\':.:~~ .. \\'\\\\ \\nfif.Ji::~;·;!ti \\'::::\\' : .. i! \\n:IIIQ~:. ~.\" I: \\'. \". \\'.:;, (\\\\Zjl \". .: I ,I ... ,: \\'>\"\\'____.

Siphonaceous \\nand true parenchymatous forms are lacking in cyanophyta. \\nCELL STRUcrURE \\nFollowing structures are found in a prokaryotic cyanophyceae cell. \\n(1) Sheath: Cell in some species possess an external diffluent delicate mucilaginous \\nsheath. The sheath is usually thick and slimy but in a few forms such as Allacystis montana \\nit is extremely delicate. The secretion of copious mucilage is an important characteristics \\nof the blue green algae and earned for them the name myxophyceae which means slime \\nalgae. Sheath serves to hold the cell colonies together. The sheath may become lamellated \\nor stratified and sometimes pigmented. In the later case it is usually yellowish or \\nbrownish in colour. Usually it is colourless. The slimy nature of the sheath endows the \\ncell with great water absorbing and water retaining capacity favouring its survival under \\nconditions of dessication. \\n(2) Cell wall: Cell possess a distinct cell wall which is relatively thick and two \\nlayered i.e. outer and inner layers. The members of order stigonematales bear well \\ndeveloped pit connections between the cells.280 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nCell wall is found between the mucilagenous sheath and cell membrane. Pectin \\nis found in the form of Calcium and Magnesium pectate. According to Carr and Whilton \\n(1973) cell wall is a tough and complex structure and divided into four layers viz. LI, \\nLII, LIII and LIV respectively. The outer layer bears cellulose, hemi-cellulose, muramic \\nacid and amino acids while the inner membrane had alanine, glucosamine, glutamic \\nacid and dipicholinic acid. The longitudinal wall of Oscillatoria bears pores. Some \\nendosymbionts viz. Cyanophora and GlalLcocystis lacks cell wall and contain plasma \\nmembrane made up of lipoprotein. \\n(3) Protoplast: The protoplast of cyanophyta is a less differentiated structure as \\nit lacks an organized nucleus with distinct surrounding membrane, endoplasmic \\nreticulum, membrane bound plastids, mitchondria, golgi apparatus, and sap vacuole. \\nCytoplasm undergoes no cyclosis and streaming movements. Under light microscope \\nthe cytoplasm appears to be divided into two region: a centrally located clear area \\nsurrounded by a denser portion. The former is called centroplasm and the latter \\nchromo plasm. The two regions are not separated from each other by any membrane \\nor other structure. \\n(i) Chromoplasm: This is the outer pigmented zone of the cell protoplast. The \\nstructure of chromo plasm is considered homogenous, finely alveolar, or reticular \\nstructure. The chromplasm contains a considerable amount of imbibed water and sticks \\nto the wall. The osmotic pressm~ of the cell is low. Chromoplasm contains a number \\nof non-living inclusions in the form of small, spherical or irregularly shaped granules. \\nMajority of them are the nature of reserve food materials which may be of proteinaceous \\nor carbohydrate nature. The carbohydrate are stored in the form of a unique kind of \\nstarch known as cyanophycian starch. The proteinaceous granules are named the \\ncyanophycean granules. In some species oil droplets as well as lipids occur in the \\nchromoplasm. \\nSome planktonic species such as Anabaena and Polycystis the chromoplasm contains \\nclusters of gas or pseudovacuoles. These are gas containing cavities within the protoplast. \\nThe walls of these vacuoles are freely permeable to the common gas. The gas filled \\npseudo-vacuoles make the algae thallus buoyant and thus rise to the surface of water. \\nThe pseudo vacuoles provide a buoyancy-regulating mechanism enabling the planktonic \\nspecie~ to poise at particular depth. \\nThe pigments under light microscope appear to be in solution in the chromoplasm. \\nThe pigments are chI-a, ~-carotene, xanthophylls and phycobilins. Phycobilins are blue \\nC-phycbcyanin and red C-phycoerythrin. Xanthophyll are zeaxanthin, myxoxanthophyll, \\nmyxoxanthin and oscilloxanthin. The phycobilins are water soluble whereas the chlorophyll \\nand carotenoid are fat soluble. \\nThis accounts for the many hues in the chromo plasm from dark-green to blue green, \\nolive green, grey-green, yellow, brown, purpled orange or red in some blue green algae \\nsuch as ChroococcllS turgidus. \\n(ii) Centroplasm: It forms the central area of the protoplast of a cyanophyte cells. \\nIt forms about 1/4 to 1/2 the volume of the cell and consist of a relatively dense massGENERAL ACCOUNT OF CYANOBACTERIA 281 \\nof material which is considered nuclear in nature. The nuclear material is arranged in \\na loose reticulum and includes fibrils in which DNA and RNA are present. In modern \\nterminology genophore is the name suggested for such a primitive nucleus. The division \\nis amitotic. \\nStarch granUle \\nCell wall \\nPyrenoid \\nre \\nFig. 2 : Cell structure \\nPHOTOSYNTHETIC PIGMENTS AND CHROMATIC ADAPTATION \\nEmbedded in the cytoplasm within the plasma membrane are elongate flattened \\nsacs named the lamellae or thylakoids. They are not seen under light microscope. The \\nlamellae tend to be concentrated and organized in parallel arrays near the periphery \\nof the protoplast. EM show that the thylakoid contain pigments and thus constitute the \\nphotosynthetic apparatus of the cyanophyte cells. Each thylakoid is bounded by two \\nunit membranes with a small flattened area in between. The thylakoid bears the \\nphotosynthetic pigment like chI-a, p-carotene and lipid globules. Phycobilisomes particles \\nare present on the surface of thylakoid. The particles contain the water soluble pigment \\nC-phycocyanin and C-phycoerythrin. Bisalputra et al. (1969) suggest that the photo \\nsynthetic lamellae provides the sites for cellular respiration also and hence should be \\ntermed as photosynthetic respiratory membrane. These membrane can change their \\npositions under certain conditions unlike other algae. In some blue green algae the visual \\ncolour of thallus depends upon the quality and type of light. For example in the presence \\nof red light the thallus of Oscillatoria appears green in colour while in yellow light it282 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nappears blue and green in the presence of red light. Thus this quality of thallus to change \\nits colour according to the colour of light it receives is called as complementary chromatic \\nadaptation or the Goidukov phenomenon called after the name of its russian discoverer, \\nGoidukov (1902, 1906 to 1923). This chromatic adaptation helps the algae to maximum \\nutilize the available light for photosynthesis. \\n(5) Nucleoid: It is found in the centroplasm portion of the cell. The DNA fibres \\nare spreaded irregularly in the nucleoid. The fibres lack histones and protamines. The \\ngenome is 2nm in width and 1.6 x 109 dalton in its molecular weight. According to \\nHerdman (1974) the genome of cyanobacteria varies from 1.2 x 109 to 7.4 X 109. It means \\nthat about 2 to 6 replicas can be made of this genome. \\n(6) Other Cell Inclusion: Irrespective of the above structures the cyanophycean \\ncell contain other cell inclusion like cyanophycean granules, polyhedral RNA containing \\nstructure polyphosphate structures, alpha and beta particles. 70S ribosomes etc. Along \\nwith this polyglucoside granules are attached with the thylakoids. According to Lang \\n(1972) these are combined forms of glycogen particles and polyphosphate structures \\nalong with this gas vacuoles or pseudovacuoles are also found. \\n(I) Gas Vacuoles or Pseudovacuoles \\nRecent observations have shown that the gas vacuoles or pseudo-vacuoles common \\nin planktonic Oscillatoria and Anabaena species are of irregular shape and consist of \\ncylindrical vesicles with conical ends stacked in arrays. These vesicles are bound by \\nsingle membrane. The membrane is permeable to common gases. Fogg (1972) has shown \\nthat the gas-vacuoles are more commonly \\nproduced under low intensity of light and \\nthen suddenly collapse under high intensity \\nof light. This results due to increased rate of \\nphotosynthesis which produces more quantity \\nof sugar and increases the osmotic pressure \\nso that there is a quick collapse of the gas- Cell wall \\nvacuoles at the surface level of water in the Plasmalemma \\nplanktonic species. After collapse the filaments \\nsink down at the bottom of water-reservoir. \\nThus gas vacuoles have a great ecological \\nimportance and serve to regulate the \\nbuoyancy of the planktonic forms. According \\nto Pringsheim (1966) the gas vacuoles are \\nproduced under anaerobic conditions in \\nOscillatoria agardltii. \\n(II) Heterocyst \\nCertain members of the genera \\nNostocales and Stigonematales (which include \\nfilamentous forms) except Oscillatoriales \\nproduce enlarged, thick walled, pale yellowish \\nspecialized cells in addition to the vegetative Fig. 3 : Ultrastructure of heterocystGENERAL ACCOUNT OF CYANOBACTERIA 283 \\ncells. These large empty looking specialized cells are called the heterocysts. The \\nheterocysts are peculiar in blue green algae. They may be terminal or intercalary in \\nposition in filamentous algae. \\nThe heterocyst develops from an ordinary vegetative cell particularly the recently \\ndivided one usually one of the daughter cell called the proheterocyst develops into a \\nheterocyst and the other into a vegetative cell. The contents become uniform and pale \\nin colour. The end walls become rounded. The other changes takes places are : \\n(i) Secretion of an inner non cellulose polysaccharide wall layer external to the \\noriginal cell membrane. \\n(ii) Formation of pore either at one or both poles of the new wall layer. \\n(iii) Establishment of protoplasmic connections with the neighbouring vegetative \\ncells through the polar pores. \\n(iv) Filling of polar pores towards maturity by mucilage which looks like shinning \\nnodules under the microscope. \\n(v) The cell contents become homogenous with chemical changes in the nucleic \\nacids. \\n(vi) Gradual loss of photosynthetic pigments except carotelloids. \\n(vii) Recent studies using electron microscope reveal that the process of transformation \\nof a vegetative cell into a heterocyst involves gradual enlargement of the entire \\ncell and cell wall becomes many layered. The photosynthetic lamellae become \\nreoriented and form a complex reticulation. \\nPHYSIOLOGY AND NATURE OF HETEROCYST \\n(i) Fritsch (1951) called the heterocyst of cyanophyta as \\'a botanical enigma\\'. \\n(ii) According to Geitler et al \"the heterocyst are archaic reproductive cells, now \\nlargely functionless but at time still fulfilling their old role. \\n(iii) Wolk (1966) & Fay et al (1968) says heterocyst playa role in sporulation. This \\nfound support from the fact that the vegetative cell near the heterocyst \\nsporulate earlier and that heterocyst is removed, there is no sporulation in \\nAnabaena cycadeae. \\n(iv) During 1969 evidence suggested that the heterocyst provide the site for the \\nfixation of atmospheric nitrogen since the enzyme nitrogenase essential in the \\nprocess of nitrogen fixation is found to be present only in heterocysts and not \\nin vegetative cell. \\n(v) Stewart (1972) believe that all nitrogen fixing blue green algae are heterocystous. \\nAll these condition sufficiently prove that the heterougst are solely meant for the \\nfixation of elementary nitrogen. \\nAccording to Fogg following factors control the production of heterocyst: \\n(i) Heterocyst formation increases under conditions of low light intensities. Blue \\ngreen light inhibit while red light promote heterocyst formation.284 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(ii) The increase in the amount of phosphate in the medium leads to increase in \\nheterocyst production. \\n(iii) The concentration of nitrogen in the medium above a certain level results in \\ncomplete inhibition of heterocyst production. \\nFUNCTIONS OF HETEROCYST \\nVarious function suggested by different workers are:-\\n(i) They are considered as a weak link of the filament or tricho·me. Thus trichome \\nbreaks down from the heterocyst portion and help in the vegetative reproduction \\nor in hormogonia formation. \\n(ii) Heterocyst also helps in the formation of endospore. For example in Nostoc \\nCOllll1lUne and Anabaena cycadacearum heterocyst helps in asexual reproduction. \\n(iii) Some consider them to be the store houses of reserve food materials. \\n(iv) In Nostoc commune and Gloetrichia raciborski they act as vestigial spores, which \\ngerminate and form new trichome on germination. \\n(v) R.N. Singh (1961) and Fogg (1974) declared that the heterocysts are the site \\nof nitrogen fixation in filamentous algae. \\n(vi) According to Serpette (1948) heterocyst provide strength to the thallus. \\n(vii) They promote the formation of akinete in the thallus. \\n(viii) They are the site of oxyrespiration. \\n(ix) In Calotlm·x weberi heterocyst act as a secondary reproductive structure. \\n(x) According to Cannabacus (1929) there is a very close relationship between \\nthe heterocyst and gas vacuole formation. \\nNUTRITION IN CYANOBACTERIA \\nThe cyanobacteria in general are obligate photoautotrophs because they can\\'t grow \\nin darkness even in the presence of organic nutrients in the substrate. The reserve food \\nmaterial is stored in the form of cyanophycean starch (a product of photosynthesis). \\nSimon (1971) suggest that these cyanophycean starch granules are made up of \\npolypeptide which contains only two amino acids viz. Arginine and Aspartic acid. \\nThe capacity of cyanobacteria to assimilate and metabolise exogenous organic \\ncompound is very limited and they can\\'t use organic compounds as a source of energy. \\nMovements: Despite the fact that blue green algae lack flagellated motile cells yet \\nsome genera like Oscillatoria, Spirulina and other show creeping or gliding movement \\nin longitudinal direction of the longitudinal axis of a filament when in contact with \\na solid or semi-solid substrate. The movement is also accompanied by a clockwise or \\nanti clock wise rotation of a trichome and is specific for a species. The filaments are \\nusually in contact with a solid or semisolid substratum and their free ends show a slow \\nor jerky but pendulum like oscillations. In Oscillatoriaceae the velocity of movement \\nis usually well over 2 ~m sec-I and ranges up to 11 ~m sec-I. The path covered by filament \\nis not straight but a curved one.GENERAL ACCOUNT OF CYANOBACTERIA 285 \\nReproduction \\nThe cyanobacteria reproduce by simple and primitive methods of reproduction \\nwhich are vegetative and asexual. Sexual reproduction is absent however genetic \\nrecombination has been reported by Kumar (1962) and Bazin (1968). Shestakov and \\nKhyen (1970) have reported genetic recombination in Allacystis ridulalls. \\nVegetative Reproduction \\nIt is generally by fission, fragmentation and by the formation of hormogonia. \\n(i) Fission: The unicellular cyanophyceae (ex. SYllecllOcystis) reproduce by this \\nmethod called binary fission. This is the chief method of multiplication in the unicellular \\nforms. The nuclear division (either by amitosis or mitosis) precedes the cell division. \\nThis is followed by cytokinesis. Under E.M. the cytokinesis reveals in filamentous algae \\nas the involution of plasma membrane. This involution latter grows inward in the middle \\nof the cell forming a_ cross plate between the two halves of the nuclear material. This \\ndivides the protoplast into two equal halves. With the centripetal growth of the cell \\nmembrane a ring-like septum arises from the inner layer of the cell wall and gradually \\ngrows inwards like a diphram with a decreasing aperture splitting the cross plate into \\ntwo layers. Each daughter protoplast comes to possess a continuous plasma membrane. \\nThe completed septum or cross wall then thickens and finally divides into two layers, \\nthe ends of which are continuous with the inner layer of the parent cell wall. A \\nconstriction appears at the surface of the cross wall of the dividing cell exposing the \\nfission between the daughter cells externally. As the daughter cells grows they set up \\nthe turgar pressure which pulls on their walls at the region of contact. The separation \\nof daughter cells thus start at the periphery which proceeds towards the axis of the \\ndividing cell gradually separating the two-daughter cells functioning as independent \\nindividuals. \\n(2) Fragmentation: This plays an important role in non-filamentous and filamentous \\ncolonies. Reaching a certain size, the colony breaks up into small parts. Each part/ \\nfragment is the beginning of a new colony which increases in size by repeated cell \\ndivision. \\nThe fragmentation may also occur by mechanical means. It may result from the \\nbites of the animals feeding on trichomes or stress caused by water currents or death \\nof certain cells. \\n(3) Hormogonia: The trichomes of filamentous genera breaks up within the \\ngelatinous sheath into short sections or segments of one-many uniform living cells. These \\nshort length cells of trichome are called hormogonia or hormogones. The hormogones \\nare delimited either by the formation of heterocyst or by the development of bi-concave \\nseparation disc or necridia (dead cell). \\nIn genera with terminal or no heterocysts the hormogonia are delimited by the \\nformation from time to time of bi-concave, gelatinous separation discs (necridia) between \\nsome of the cells of the trichome. A living cell here and there in the trichome undergo \\nlysis. Its protoplast breaks down to form viscous substance. The mucilage filled dead286 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\ncells are called necridia. The necridium loses turgidity with the result that the mutual \\npressure on the walls of the adjacent cells is released. They bulge out and becomes \\nconvex. These biconcave dead cells are also called the biconcave separation discs because \\nthese provide weak links and thus serve to break the trichome into hormogones. The \\nhormogones may be 2-3 cells or several cells long. \\n(a) 8p m l \\n(d) \\nEndospore in \\nDermocarpa \\n(b) (a-b) Fonnation of honnogonia (~( \\nin oscillatoria Endospore ill Chamaesiphon \\nFig. 4 : Member of Cyanophyceae showing different method \\nof vegetative reproduction \\nAsexual Reproduction \\nThe member of cyanophyceae reproduce by the formation of non-motile, asexual \\nspores which are of various sorts. \\n(1) Akinetes: These are thick walled \\'resistant resting\\' cells which are frequently \\ndeveloped singly next to a heterocyst. These spore like structure contain the entire \\nprotoplast of the cell and have the original parent cell wall as tile outer portion of the \\nspore wall. \\nSeenayya and Suba Raju (1970) observed that phosphorous deficiency of water \\nresulted in increased production of akinete bearing trichomes in Annbaenopsis raciborskii. \\nThese akinetes are modified ordinary vegetative cells. Cell increase in size and \\naccumulates food reserves. They are yellow brown i.n colour cell wall is highly resistant \\nand is often differentiated i.nto two layers. \\nWith the onset of conditions (favourable) akinetes absorb moisture, the thick, \\nresistant wall softens and the protoplast awakens to activity. Prior to emergence through \\nthe end of the softened or ruptured akinete wall the protoplast may undergo many \\ntransverse divisions or it may not undergo the first transverse division and protrudes \\nout of the ruptured wall. The germling (the filamentous forms) behaves like a \\nhormogonium. \\nAkinete formation: The initial step is the cell enlargement which is the first step \\ntowards differentiation of vegetative cell into akinete. This is followed by condensation \\nof the mucilaginous sheath and formation of a dense fibrillar layer over the cell surface. \\nSimultaneously there is deposition of several additional spore wall layers between the \\nfibrillar layer and inner investment and of cyanophycean granules in the periphery of \\nthe cytoplasm. The mature akinete retains cyanophycean and also the thylakoid, \\npolyhedral bodies, lipid deposits and nucleoplasm regions.GENERAL ACCOUNT OF CYANOBACTERIA 287 \\nAkinetes \\n(b) Anabaena \\nFig. 5 : Cyanophyceae-Distribution of Akinctes \\n(2) Endospores: These are small spores formed endogenously within a vegetative \\ncell of the unicellular or cushioned forms of chamaesiphonales which do not form \\nhormogonia. At the time of endospore formation the vegetative cell increases in size. \\nThe protoplast divides by the method of successive bipartition. A large number of small, \\nuninucleated daughter protoplasts are formed. Each daughter protoplast secretes a wall \\naround it to become an endospore. The endospore wall is secreted on liberation. The \\nspore wall is quiet distinct from the wall of parent cell. The liberated endospore \\ngerminates immediately without a resting period. ego Dermocarpa pacifica. \\n(3) Exospores: In Chamaesiphon the cell wall ruptures at the distal end of the \\nvegetative cell. The spores are successively pinched off at the exposed end of the \\nextruded protoplast. They are called exospores. Each exospore is surrounded by a \\ndelicate membrane. \\n(4) Nannocytes: Some non-filamentous blue-green algae such as Microcystis the cell \\ncontent divide repeatedly without any cell enlargement. The successive division follow \\nclosely one upon the other. Numerous daughter cells are produced in each parent cell. \\nThese are called nannocytes. These nannocytes are naked protoplast. They are extremely \\nsmall in size, closely packed which germinate in situ to give rise to new typical colonies. \\n(5) Hormospores or Hormocyst: Some members like Wiestiella produces a thick \\nwalled cells in the hormogonia segment. These structures are known as hormospores \\nwhich on germination give rise to new thallus.288 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nI Endospores \\n8 c \\no \\nFig. 6 : Cyanobacteria showing various types of spores. \\n(a) & (b) Endospores (c) Exospores (d) Hormospores \\nSexual Reproduction or Genetic Recombination \\nTrue sexual reproduction is totally absent in cyanophyceae.

There is a transfer of \\ngenetic material between two mating cells. The transfer process is slow in comparison \\nto the bacteria. \\nClolssification: According to G. Smith, the cyanophyceae is divided into three main \\norders which differ from one another in their vegetative structure and methods of \\nreproduction.

They include several physiologically and \\nmorphologically distinctive photosynthesizing bacteria, such as those included in the \\nphyla cyanobacteria, chlorobi (green sulphur bacteria) and chloroflexi (green nonsulphur \\nbacteria). The cyanobacteria produce oxygen during photosynthesis, and the green sulphur \\nand green non-sulphur bacteria do not produce oxygen. \\nThe gram-negative eubacteria include a number of species that are obligately \\nanaerobic. The gram-negative fermentative bacteria are capable of fermenting a wide range \\nof sugars, amino acids and other organic acids, some are capable of fumarate or nitrate\\xad\\nlinked respiration.

The individual fibrils that compose the axial filament \\noriginate near the ends of the cell and are normally more than half the length of the cell. \\nSpirochetes have a typical gram-negative cell wall and a well developed periplasmic space \\nthat encloses the flagella called endoflagella (axial filament). Endoflagella are constrained \\nsomewhat like limbs in a sleeping bag, their flexing propels the cell by rotation and even \\ncrawling motions. \\nThe fibrils of the axial filament have a fine structure essentially the same as that \\nof flagella; a basal body containing a series of disks; a hook; and the filament itself. The \\nnumber of disks varies among the spirochetes: Leptospira typically has two pairs of disks, \\nwhereas most other spirochetes have a single pair of disks. The filaments are often \\nenveloped in a proteinaceous sheath unlike the eubacterial flagellum which, if sheathed, \\nis surrounded by an extension of the outer membrane. The close structural and chemical \\nresemblance between the axial fibril and the flagellum, as well as their similar role in \\nmotility, suggests that they are homologous organelles. The term endoflagella and \\nperiplasmic flagella have accordingly been proposed to describe axial fibrils. \\nThe spirochetes are classified in the order spirochaetales which contain two families \\nand five ganera. The majority of spirochetes are free living saprobes or commensals of \\nanimals and are not primary pathogens. But three genera that contain major human \\npathogens are Treponema, Leptospira and Borrelia. \\nm~~--- Axial filament \\n.......... 1000-_ Cell wall \\nCell membrane \\n\"-?-H--Cytoplasm \\nFig. 1 : Ultrastructure of Spirochetes292 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMovement in Spirochetes \\nSpirochetes are all very actively motile, exhibiting a variety of translational and non \\ntranslational movements. Among the latter are twisting, lashing and writhing movements \\nthat are characteristic of the group. Since these movements are very rapid and since the \\ncells are often so thin as to be at the edge of detection with the light microscope, they \\nlook as if they were instantaneously moving from one position to another. On surfaces, \\nspirochetes can glide, a motility often termed creeping rather than gliding. They also \\nexhibit an \\'inchworm\\' kind of motility, in which one end of the cell attaches to the surface, \\nand the other end attaches nearby: the first end then detaches and reattaches at a distance. \\nRepitition of these steps results in relatively rapid movement. \\nThe axial filament has long been suspected to playa role in motility, suspicion that \\nwas strengthened when the structural resemblance between their constituent fibers and \\nbacterial flagella was recognized. The isolation of immotile mutants with altered axial \\nfibrils confirms the role of endoflegella in motility. \\nNevertheless, it is still unclear how motion is actually effected. Because of the \\nstructural homology between flagella and endoflagella, it is tempting to propose that they \\nshere a similar mechanism, namely rotation from the base of the filament. How endoflagellar \\nrotation would result in cell movement is controversial. However it is clearly not due to \\nrotation of the cell as a whole; rather a helical wave is propagated down the cell. Two \\nfundamental mechanisms are envisaged-rotation of flexible endoflagella may cause the \\nrigid helical murein-bound protoplast to rotate within the outer membrane or rotation of \\nthe rigid helical endoflagella may cause the liable cell body to flex in the form of a helical \\nwave. \\nS.No. \\n1. \\n2. \\n3. \\n4. \\n5. \\nFig. 2 : Movement in spirochete \\nTABLE 1 \\nCharacteristic Features of Spirochetes in Pure Culture \\nCharacters Trepollema Borrelia Leptospira \\nCell diameter 0.1-0.4 llm 0.2-0.5 llm 0.1 llm \\nRelationship to 02 Anaerobe Microaerophile Aerobe \\nEnergy metabolism Fermentative Fermentative Respiratory \\nPercent G + C 22-54 Unknown 35-52 \\nCarbon and energy Sugars or Sugars Fatty acid \\nsource Amino acids or fatty alcohols \\nContd ...GRAM -ve BACTERIA 293 \\n...

One of the first \\ndetectable steps in division is the appearance of a new set of endoflagella originating \\nat the middle of the cell. A septum then is laid down between the basal bodies, and the \\ntwo daughter cells separate. However, such coupling between cell division and cell \\nseparation is not universal, there are strains of spirochaeta that are multicellular filaments \\nup to 250 ~m long.294 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nDiversity of Spirochetes \\nLipids are a major part of the spirochetes cell mass. All but leptospires contain \\nmonogalactosyl-diglyceride as one of their polar lipids; Borrelia also contains cholesterol. \\nThe envelope of many spirochetes contains substantial amounts of. polysaccharide of \\nvarying composition. The presence of 3-0- methylmannose in this carbohydrate fraction \\nis characteristic of Leptospira. \\nSpirochetes are free living and characteristically inhabit anaerobic or microaerobic \\nsediments. They have a high sulfide tolerance, important in sediments that support active \\nsulphur reduction. They ferment carbohydrates via the Embden-Meyer hoff pathway to \\npyruvate, which is cleaned by a clostridial-type classic reaction to acetyl Co-A. Fermentation \\nproducts are ethanol, acetate, CO 2 and H2 \\nTreponema includes a number of parasitic but not pathogenic anaerobes. They \\ninclude both amino acid-fermenting and carbohydrate fermenting strains produce acetate \\nand butyrate as major products, sometimes accompanied by varying amounts of succinate \\nor lactate, and ethanol and butanol. The amino acid fermenting strains produce principally \\nacetate, with varying amounts of propionate, butyrate or lactate. \\nThe Leptospires are the only obligately aerobic spirochetes. They require fatty acids \\nnot only as precursors of membrane lipids, but also as their respiratory substrate, they \\ncannot respire carbohydrates or other compounds. They have a characteristic morphology, \\nthe posterior end of swimming cells is always hooked, while the anterior end is straight \\nor helical, immobile cells may be hooked at both ends. \\nSymbiosis with Invertebrate Animals \\nThe hindgut of termites and wood-eating roaches is a fermentation chamber in \\nwhich ingested cellulose is fermented by the microbial inhabitants. The microbial flora \\nof many of these insects is characterized by flagellate protozoa and by large spirochetes, \\nmany of which are attached to the surface of the protozoa. Several genera have been \\nproposed for these spirochetes; their collective name is pillotinas after the generic name \\nof one of them. In some cases it is clear that the attached pillotinas provide motility for \\nthe host protozoan; the flagella steer, while the propulsive force is due to coordinated \\nswimming motions by the spirochetes. The pillotinas are a morphologically diverse group; \\nthey characteristically have a large number of endoflagella, and their outer membrane is \\noften crenulated or grooved. \\nTreponema pallidum \\n[The Spirochete of Syphilis] \\nThe human is evidently the sole natural host and source of T. pallidum. It is an \\nextremely fastidious and sensitive bacterium that cannot survive for long outside the host, \\nbeing rapidly destroyed by heat, drying disinfectants, soap, high oxygen tension and ph \\nchanges. It survives a few minutes to hours when protected by body secretions and about \\n34 hrs in stored blood. \\nInfection is usually acquired by sexual contact with infected individuals, and isGRAM -ve BACfERIA 295 \\ncommonest in the most sexually active age group of 15-30 yr oIds. Rarely, syphilis has \\nbeen acquired by transfusion of infected fresh human blood. \\nPrimary Syphilis: The earliest indication of syphilis infectioll is the appearance of \\na hard canker at the site of inoculation, after an incubation period that varies from nine \\ndays to three months. The canker begins as a small, red, hard, bumps that enlarges and \\nbreaks down, leaving a shallow crater with firm margins. The base of the ulcers beneath \\nthe encrusted surface swarms with spirochetes. The cankers heals spontaneously without \\nscarring in three to six weeks, but this healing is deceptive, because \\nthe spirochete has escaped into the circulation and is entering a period tremendous \\nactivity. \\nSecondary Syphilis: About 3-6 months after the canker (an injurious sore) heals, \\nthe secondary stage appears. By then, many systems of the body have been invaded and \\nthe symptoms are more profuse and intense. Initially there is fever, headache and sore \\nthroat, followed by lymphadenopathy and a peculiar red or brown rash that breaks out \\non all skin surfaces, including the palms and the soles. The major complications develop \\nin the bones, hair follicles, joints, liver, eyes, brain and kidneys. \\nBorrelia \\n[Relapsing Fevers] \\nEpidemic or tick borne relapsing fever is caused by several Borrelia sp. Including \\nB. duttoni, B. hermsii B. parkeri and B. turicatae, and is transmitted to huma~ by soft bodied \\nornithodorus ticks. The natural hosts for these organisms include rodents and other small \\nmammals on which the ticks normally feed. \\nEpidemic or louse-borne relapsing fever is caused by B. recurrentis, an obligate \\nhuman pathogen transmitted from person to person by the body louse, Pediculus humanus. \\nThe spirochetes causing the two forms of relapsing fever differ in their mode of \\ngrowth in the arthropod vector, and this influence the way human infection is initiated. \\nB. recurrentis grows in the haemolymph of the louse but does not invade tissues. \\nAs a result the excrement of the louse is non-infectious and the bacterium is not transferred \\ntransovarially to the progeny. Human infection occurs when bacteria released from \\ncrushed lice gain entry to tissues through damaged or intact skin or mucous membranes. \\nTransovarial transmission to the tick progeny maintains the spirochete in the tick \\npopulation. \\nIn both forms of relapSing fever, acute symptoms, including high fever, rigors, \\nheadache, myalgia, arthralgia, photophobia and cough, develop about one week after \\ninfection. A skin rash may occur and there is central nervous system involvement in up \\nto 30% of cases. During the acute phase there may be up to 105 spirochetes per cubic \\nmillimeter of blood. The primary illness resolves within 3-6 days, and terminates abruptly \\nwith hypotension and shock, which may be fatal. Relapse of fever occurs 7-10 days later, \\nand several relapses may take place. \\nLyme Disease \\nLyme disease is a recently described syndrome, originally called lyme arthritis.

The adult tick reproductive phase of the cycle is completed on deer. \\nThe natural host for B. burgdorferi are wild and domestic animals, including mice \\nand other rodents, deer, sheep, cattle, horses and dogs.

The lesion, called erythema migrans, looks \\nsomething like a bull\\'s eye, with a raised erythematous ring that gradually spreads \\noutward and a pale central region. Other early symptoms are fever, headache, stiff neck \\nand dizziness. If not treated or if treated too late, the disease can advance to the second \\nstage, during which cardiace dysrhythmias and neurological symptoms such as facial \\npalsy develop. After several weeks or months, a crippling polyarthritis can attack joints, \\nespecially in the European strain of the agent Some people acquire chronic neurological \\ncomplications that are severely disabling. \\nRICKETISIA \\nThe rickettsia are named after H.T. Ricketts, who discovered American \\'Rocky \\nMountain spotted fever\\'. This group is also referred to as the \\'Spotted fever\\' (typhus fever) \\ngroup after the disease produced by the best known of these pathogens (Rickettsia \\nprowazekiz). Their natural distribution is by host vectors such as lice, fleas, ticks, mites, \\netc in which they exist as harmless parasites or even symbionts. On being transferred \\nto other animal hosts or humans by bites, scratches or inhalation, they produce very \\nserious disease symptoms. \\'GRAM -ve BACTERIA 297 \\nThe Rickettsias are small rods with the fine structure typical of gram-negative \\neubacteria. The genera Rickettsia and Coxiella are obligate intracellular parasites that differ \\nin their location within the host cell. Both enter their host cells by inducing phagocytosis, \\neven by cells that are not normally phagocytic. Within host cells, the rickettsias reproduced \\nby binary fission. They cling together in pairs after fission. Rickettsias are not motile as \\nno flagella have been observed. They do not produce endospores. The organisms were \\nconsidered to be the product of \\' degenerative evolution\\' of bacteria as a result of obligate \\nintracellular parasitism. The DNA extracted from rickettsias is double stranded the \\norganisms are capable of generating their own ATP as evidenced by oxidation of amino \\nacid and glutamate. \\nCoxiella forms endospores that are resistant to drying and other environmental \\nstresses. They are substantially smaller than the vegetative cells, appear to have a reduced \\nmetabolic rate, and they lack dipicolinic acid, a compound characteristic of the endospores \\nof gram-positive bacteria. \\nThe rickettsias cause several human diseases which are transmitted by arthropod \\nvectors such as fleas, mites, lice and ticks. They are apparently not pathogenic to these \\narthropods but are pathogenic to man and other animals. Some diseases of man are fatal \\nego The typhus fever which is epidemic caused by R. prawazeki, transmitted to man by \\nbody lice. The disease is characterized by abrupt severe ache, fever, and chills followed \\nby rash on back and chest. \\nTABLE 3 \\nHuman Diseases Caused by Rickettsia Species \\nSpecies Disease \\nTyphus group \\nR.prowazekii Epidemic \\ntyphus \\nGeographical \\ndistribution \\nExtant foci in \\nAfrica, North \\nand South \\nAmerica \\nMode of Primary \\ntransmission vectors \\nLouse faeces Pediculus \\nhumanus \\ncorporis \\nR. typhi Murine \\ntyphus \\nPrimarily tropics Flea faeces \\nand subtropics \\nXenopsylla \\ncheopis and \\nother fleas \\nSpotted fever group \\nR. akari Rickettsial \\npox \\nUSA, Ukraine, Bite of mouse Liponyssoides \\nCroatia, korea mite sanguineus \\nR. australis Queensland Australia \\ntick typhus \\nBite of tick \\nR. conorii Boutonneuse Europe, Africa, Bite of tick \\nfever Middle East \\nIndia \\nIxodes \\nholocydus \\nRhipicephalus \\nMain \\nvertebrate hosts \\nHumans, flying \\nsquirrels \\nRodents & other \\nsmall mammals \\nHouse mice; \\npossibly other \\nrodents \\nUnknown \\nRodents & other \\nsmall mammals298 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe other important rickettsial disease of humans is the \\'rocky mountain spotted \\nfever\\' caused by Rickettsia rickettsi transmitted by ticks. Ticks that acquire the infection \\nremain infective for a life time. \\nThe genus Rickettsia is currently divided into two antigenically distinct group and \\nthe spotted fever group, which are very closely related. They have a typical gram-negative \\nbacterial cell wall, including a bilayered outer membrane that contain the lipopolysaccharide \\nantigens that distinguish the two groups. External to the outer membrane there appears \\nto be a slime layer, probably composed of polysaccharides. Electrophoresis has demonstrated \\na number of distinct and common proteins in both groups of rickettsiae. The \\nimmunodominant rickettsial outer membrane proteins A (Omp A)· has been studied \\nprincipally in the spotted fever group rickettsiae. It contains a hydrophilic region of tandem \\nrepeat units that determine the diversity of molecular size and antigens largely by the \\nnumber, order and type of repeat units. Omp B is a typical autotransporter protein and \\nis abundant in both groups of rickettsiae. Omp A and Omp B both contain cross reactive \\nand species-specific epitopes. \\nPathogenesis \\nRickettsiae normally enter the body through the bite and dust from hides or pelts \\nof infected animals may contain large numbers of highly infectious spores from dried fecal \\nmaterial of arthropod parasites such as ticks. They are disseminated through the blood \\nstream, enter endothelial cells by induced phagocytosis, escape from the phagosome, \\nmultiply intracellularly and eventually destroy their host cells. Observations in cell culture \\nsystems suggest that spotted fever and typhus group rickettsiae destroy the host cell by \\ndifferent mechanism. \\nA common target in rickettsial infections is the endothelial lining of the small blood \\nvessels. The bacteria recognize, enter and multiply within endothelial cells, causing \\nnecrosis of the vascular living. Among the immediate pathological consequences are \\nvasculities, perivascular infiltration by inflammatory cells, vascular leakage and \\nthrombosis. These pathologic effects are manifested by skin rash, edema, hypotension \\nand gangrene. \\nIntravascular clotting in the brain accounts for the stuporous mental changes and \\nother neurological symptoms that sometimes occur. \\nSpecific Rickettsioses \\nRickettsioses can be differentiated on the basis of their clinical features and \\nepidemiology as: \\n1.

Humans are the only natural \\nvertebrate hosts. Several animals-guinea pigs, mice, cotton rats and gerbils-may be infected \\nexperiment. The human body louse Pediculus humanus corporis is the vector. The head louse \\nmay also transmit the infection but not the public louse. The lice become infected by feeding \\non rickettsiaemic patients. The rickettsiae multiply in the gut of the lice and appear in the \\nfeces in 3-5 days. Lice succumb to the infection within 2-4 weeks, remaining infective till \\nthey die. The lethal nature of the infection in the louse suggests that the association between \\nR. prawazekii and its vector is relatively recent and not well established. Lice may be \\ntransferred from person to person. Infection is transmitted when the contaminated louse \\nfeces is rubbed through the minute abrasions caused by scratching. The disease starts with \\nfever and chills. A characteristic rash appears on the fourth or fifth day, starting on the \\ntrunk and spreading over the limbs but sparing the face, palm and soles. Towards the second \\nweek, the patient becomes stuporous and delirious. The name typhus comes from the cloudy \\nstate of consciousness in the disease (from typhos, meaning cloud or smoke).300 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nEndemic Typhus \\n[Murine or Fleaborne typhus] \\nIt is a milder disease than epidemic typhus. It is caused by. R. hJPhi which is \\nmaintained in nature as a mild infection of rats, transmitted by the rat flea Xenopsylla \\nc1zeopis. The rickettsia multiplies in the gut of the flea and is shed in its feces. The flea \\nis unaffected but remains infectious for the rest of its natural span of life. \\nHumans acquire the disease usually through the bite of infected fleas, when their \\nsaliva or feces is rubbed in or through aerosols of dried feces. Ingestion of food recently \\ncontaminated with infected rat urine or flea feces may also cause infection. Human \\ninfection is a dead end. Man to man transmission does not occur. \\nThe clinical manifestations of endemic typhus include fever, headache, muscle \\naches, and malaise. After five days, a skin rash, transient in milder cases, begins on the \\ntrunk and radiates toward the extremities. Symptoms dissipate in about two weeks. \\nTetracycline and chloramphenicol are effective therapeutic agents, while various pesticides \\nare available for vector and rodent control. \\nScrub Typhus \\nTsutsugamushi Disease \\nThe illness caused by R. tsutsugamushi. Scrub typhus rickettsias live naturally in \\nthe bodies of chigger mites. Infected mammalian and avian hosts help perpetuate the \\nreservoir. Humans are attacked by chiggers (mite larvae) while passing through forests \\nand parkland. The mite feeds on the serum of warm blooded animals only once during \\nits cycle of development and adult mites feed only on plants. The microbes are transmitted \\ntransovarially in mites. Various rodents and birds act as reservoirs. \\nAt the site of a mite bite, a distinctive black scab develops in one to three weeks. \\nEarly symptoms of fever, headache and muscle aches resemble, those of endemic typhus \\nand in about half the cases, a generalized rash originates on the trunk and radiates \\nperipherally. Severe cases are accompanied by mental confusion, delirium, pneumonia and \\ncirculatory collapse. \\nRocky Mountain Spotted Fever \\nRickettsia of this group possess a common soluble antigen and multiply in the \\nnucleus as well as in the cytoplasm of host cells. R. rickettsii, the etiological agent of Rocky \\nMountain spotted fever, discovered by Ricketts in 1906 in smears from infected animals \\nand patients, and later discovered that it was transmitted by ticks, which therefore act \\nas both vectors and reservoirs. The infection may be transmitted to vertebrate hosts by \\nany of the larval stages or by adult ticks. Ticks are not harmed by the rickettsia and remain \\ninfected for life. The rickettsia are shed in tick feces but transmission to human beings \\nis primarily by bite, as the rickettsia also invade the salivary glands of the ticks. All \\nrickettsia of tllis group pass through natural cycles in domestic and wild animals or birds. \\nPathogenesis: After two to four days incubation, the first symptoms are sustained \\nfever, chills, headache and muscular pain. The distinctive spotted rash usually comes onGRAM -ve BACTERIA 301 \\nwithin two to four days after the prodromium. It starts on the wrist and ankles, moves \\nto the arms and legs, converges toward the chest and eventually covers the entire body. \\nEarly lesions are slightly mottled like measles, but later ones are macular, maculopopular \\nand even- petechial. \\nIn severe cases, the enlarged lesions merge and can become necrotic, predisposing \\nto gangrene of the toes or finger tips. Other grave manifestations of diseases are \\ncardiovascular disruption, including hypotension, thrombosis, and hemorrhage. Conditions \\nof restlessness, delirium, convulsions, tremor and coma are signs of the often overwhelming \\neffects on the central nervous system. \\nQ. Fever \\nAs the etiological agent of the disease was unknown, it was refered to as \\'Query\\' \\nor Q fever. As Burnet identified the causative agent as a rickettsia, it was named R. burnetii, \\nlater named Coxiella burnetti. This is highly resistant due to its production of an unusual \\ntype of spores and it is apparently harbored by a wide assortment of vertebrates and \\narthropods, especially ticks. Arthropod vectors play an essential role in transmitting the \\nrickettsia between wild and domestic animals, but transmission to humans is largely by \\nmeans of environmental contamination and airborne spread. \\nSources of infectious material include urine, feces, milk and air borne particles from \\ninfected animals. The primary portals of entry are the lungs, skin, conjunctiva, and \\ngastrointestinal tract. People at highest risk are farm workers meat cutters, wool and leather \\nworkers and lab technicians. The clinical manifestations typical of Coxiella infection are \\nabrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle ache but rarely are skin rashes seen. \\nTrench Fever: The causative agent is Bartollella Quill ta Il a, like epidemic typhus, \\ncycles between humans and lice, but unlike the typhus rickettsia, does not multiply \\nintracellularly and does not kill the louse vector. Highly variable symptoms can include \\na 5-6 day fever, leg pains, especially in the tibial region, headache, chills and muscle \\naches. \\nCat-scratch Disease: Infection connected with a cat scratch or bite. The symptoms \\nstart after 1-2 weeks, with a cluster of small papules at the site of inoculation. In a few \\nweeks the lymph nodes along the lymphatic drainage swell and can become pus-filled. \\nCHLAMYDIA \\nThe Chlamydias are Gram-negative eubacteria that are obligate intracellular parasites \\nand that like Coxiella, have a life cycle that includes a resistant stage that mediates \\ntransmission. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacterial parasite of humans, animals \\nand birds with tropism for squamous epithelial cells and macrophages of the respiratory \\nand gastrointestinal h·acts. They possess both DNA and RNA, have cell wall and \\nribosomes, replicate by binary fission without an eclipse phase and are susceptible to the \\nusual antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents. \\nChlamydias alternate between two distinct stages: \\n(A) A small metabolically inactive, infectious form called the elementary body that \\nis released by the infected host cell, and302 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(B) A larger noninfectious, actively dividing form called the reticulate body that \\ngrows within the host cell vacuoles. This terminology was devised prior to the full \\nrealization of the bacterial nature of the chlamydias. \\nElementary bodies are tiny, dense spheres shielded by a rigid, impervious envelope \\nthat ensures survival outside the eukaryotic host cell. Reticulate bodies are finely \\ngranulated and have thin cell walls. \\nTo emphasize the homology of cellular processes in the chlamydias and other \\nbacteria, we shall call the actively growing cell (reticulate body)-vegetative cell and the \\ninfectious form (elementary body). \\n(6) The elementary bodies \\nare released from the \\nhost cell \\n(5) The reticulate \\nbodies begin to \\nconvert back into \\nelementary bodies \\n(4) The reticulate body \\ndivides successively, \\nproducing multiple \\nreticulate bodies \\nChlamydiospores \\nHost cell \\n(1) The microbe\\'s infectious \\nform, the elementary \\nbody, attaches to a host \\ncell \\nNucleus \\nVacuole forming -.---......~ \\n(2) The host cell \\nphagocytizes the \\nelementary body, \\nhousing it in a \\nvacuole \\nVacuole \\nrf11,/-:-~+-- Reticulate body \\nFig. 4 : Life cycle of Chlamydia \\n(3) The elementary body \\nreorganizes to form a \\nreticulate body \\nThe chlamydiospore is small, with a rigid cell wall; they lack detectable metabolic \\nactivity. When it contacts a host cell, it includes phagocytocis by the host cell; the rest of \\nthe life cycle occurs within the phagosome. Some component of the chlamydiospores inhibits \\nthe fusion of phagosome with lysosomes; presumably there art? other changes in the \\nphagosomes membrane that allow permeation by host metabolites needed by the parasite. \\nThe chlamydiospore enlarges; loses its rigidity, and begins macromolecular synthesis. Since \\nthe chlamydiospore is very low in RNA; particular rRNA, initial protein and RNA synthesis \\nis probably devoted. to increasing the number of ribosomes. Following a period of growth \\nand division by binary fission, the vegetative cells convert to chlamydiospores.GRAM -ve BACfERIA 303 \\nThe genus Chlamydia contains four species: C. trachomatis; C. psittaci, C. pneumolliae, \\nwhich can affect humans; and the fourth species; C. pecomm created recently to include \\nsome strains affecting ruminants. \\nDiseases of Chlamydia trachoma tis \\nThe reservoir by pathogenic strains of Chlamydia trachoma tis is the human body. \\nThe microbe shows astoundingly broad distribution within the population, often being \\ncarried with no symptoms. Elementary bodies are transmitted in infectious secretions, and \\nalthough infection can occur in all age groups, disease is most severe in infants and \\nchildren. \\nChlamydial Disease of the Eye: The two forms of chlamydial eye disease, ocular \\ntrachoma and inclusion conjunctivitis, differ in their patterns of transmission and ecology. \\nOcular trachoma, an infection of the epithelial cells of the eye, is an ancient disease and \\na major cause of blindness in certain parts of the world. \\nThe first signs of infectious are a mild conjunctival exudates and slight inflammation \\nof the conjunctiva. This is followed by marked infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages \\ninto the infected area. In time, a vascular pseudomembrane of exudates and inflammatory \\nleukocytes forms over the cornea, a condition called pannus that lasts a few weeks and \\nusually heals. Complications contributing most to corn. \\nTransmission is favored by contaminated fingers, fomites, flies and a hot, dry \\nclimate. \\nGLIDING BACfERIA (THE MYXOBACfERIA) \\nThese groups of bacteria are able to move by gliding or creeping. The gliding bacteria \\nare a mixed collection of gram negative bacteria that live in water and soil. The name \\nis derived from tendency of members to glide over moist surfaces. There are several \\nmorphologic forms, including slender rods, long filaments, cocci & some miniature tree \\nshaped fruiting bodies. \\nA. Unicellular, rod shaped bacteria, including the mycobacteria, the Cytopllaga group \\nand Flexibacter groups. \\nB. The thread like gliding bacterium Chloroflexus \\nC. Bacteria that contain intracellular sulphur, of which there are trichome forming \\n(Beggiatoa, thiothrix) and unicellular (Achromatium) organisms. \\nD. Sulphur-free bacteria existing as trichomes such as Vitreoscilla, Leucotlzrix and \\nSaprospira as well as the mouth Oxcillatoria Simollsiella and Alysiella. \\nE. Cyanobacteria, if they are motile at all, move by gliding. \\nThe Flexibacter species are aquatic bacteria. They are long, very flexible cells but not \\nmulticellular. During continuous cultivation these become shorter and eventually fragment \\ninto coccoid cells. Many forms contain carotenoids and show yellow, pink or orange \\npigmentation. \\nBeggiatoa is a colourless, threadlike sulphur bacterium. The cells are filled with304 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nsulphur droplets, which makes the colourless threads appear white. The threads are motile \\nby gliding, Beggiatoa is an aerobic organism and looks like masses of spider\\'s webs either \\ncovering the black putrid mud of slow moving waters or in the sea when water containing \\nhydrogen sulphide is exposed to atmospheric oxygen. The sulphide is oxidized to \\nsulphate. Thiothrix is not freely motile. Bunches or tufts of trichomes are attached by their \\nbases to solid surfaces. Multiplication is by gonidia, which are formed by the rounding \\noff of apical cells. Conidia can glide over solid surfaces. Thiothrix is much more widespread \\nthan Beggiatoa and grows in waters in which rotting organic material gives rise to \\nhydrogen sulphide. \\nVitreoscilla is a colourless, aerobic, multicellular, filamentous bacterium which moves \\nby gliding and multiplies by fragmentation of the filaments. It can be isolated from cow \\ndung. Leucothrix grows epiphytically on marine algae. The sulphur bacterium Thiosphirillopsis \\njloridana and the organotrophic Saprospira graudis can be compared to the helically wound \\ncyanobacterium Spirulina. \\nMyxobacteria are differentiated from other gliding chemoheterotrophs by their high \\nG + C content and unicellular morphology. They are soil bacteria and are characterized \\nin their natural habitat by the formation of fruiting bodies that are very small. Such fruiting \\nbodies are found in decaying plant material, rotting wood, tree bark and on the faeces \\nof herbivores. The vegetative cells are rods, which are usually quite flexible. \\nThe myxobacteria are soil organisms and are usually detected in nature through \\nthe development of their fruiting bodies on solid substrates. Myxobacteria are strict aerobes \\nthat fall into two nutritional subgroups:-\\n(a) Bacteriolytic and (b) Cellulolytic organism \\nMost of the myxobacteria can lyse bacteria by exoenzymes, whilst only the genus \\nPolyangium contains cellulolytic species. \\nWhat sets the myxobacteria apart from other bacteria is the complexity and \\nadvancement of their life cycle. During this cycle, the vegetative cells swarm together and \\ndifferentiate into a many-celled, colored structure called the fruiting body. The fruiting \\nbody is a survival structure that makes spores by a method very similar to that of certain \\nfungi. These fruiting structures are often large enough to be seen with the unaided eye \\non tree bark and plant debris. \\nOn solid media myxobacteria form very extensive flat colonies. When the vegetative \\ncells inside the colonies aggregate, they differentiate into fruiting bodies that differ in \\nshape, size and pigmentation for the various genera and species of the myxobacteria. \\nDuring maturation, the cells inside the fruiting bodies become dormant i.e., they are \\nconverted to myxospores. \\nThe Cytophaga group contains the genera Cytophaga and Sporocytophaga. In contrast \\nto the Myxobacteriales, the cytophagales do not produce furifing bodies. Genera in the \\norder cytophagales exhibit widely differing morphological forms and modes of metabolism. \\nThey are unified by the presence of gliding motion and lack of fruiting body formation. \\nAs a consequence of teir hydrolyfic activities, these gliding bacteria are important \\necolobically in the decomosition of organic matter.GRAM -ve BACTERIA 305 \\nTHE SHEATHED BACTERIA \\nSome filamentous bacteria form tubular envelops described as sheaths (Sphaerotilus \\nllatalls, Leptothrix ochracea) these sheaths consist of heteropolysaccharide containing \\nglucose, glucuronic acid, galactose and fructose.

Reproduction occurs by the \\nliberation of cells from the open apex of the sheath. Three principal genera, Sphaerotilus, \\nLeptothrix and Haliscomenobacter are distinguishable. Sphaerotilus forms thin sheaths, \\nnormally without encrustations of metal oxides. It is found in slowly running streams \\ncontaminated with sewage or other organic matter, where it grows as long, slimy, attached \\ntassels. It also develops in aerobic sewage digestors. \\nThe formation of a sheath enables these bacteria to attach to solid surfaces. This \\nis important to the ecology of these bacteria because many sheathed bacteria live in low \\nnutrient aquatic habitats. By absorbing nutrients from the water that flows by the \\nattached cells, these bacteria conserve their limited energy resources. Additionally, the \\nsheaths afford protection against predators and parasites. In some cases, the sheaths \\nmay be covered with metal oxides. For example, in the genus Leptothrix, sheaths are \\nencrusted with iron or manganese oxides. In other genera, such as Haliscomenobacter, \\nthis does not occur. In the genus Sphaerotilus, the sheath is sometimes encrusted with \\niron oxides. \\nLeptothrix is common in uncontaminated fresh water containing metal salts, where \\nits sheaths are heavily encrusted with hydrated ferric or manganic oxides. Haliscomenobacter \\nis abundant in aerobic sewage treatment systems. Its long, thin cells are enclosed in a \\nbarely visible sheath.

Chemolithotrophs \\nutilize the energy present in chemical compounds and carbon in the form of carbon \\ndioxide. Chemolithotrophic bacteria are very important to the biogeochemical cycling of \\nvarious elements. These include organisms like Beggiatoa (utilizing hydrogen sulfide as \\nenergy source), Nitrosomonas (utilizing ammonia as energy source), Thiobacillus (utilizing \\niron), Nitrobacter (using nitries) etc. These microorganisms have simpler nutritional \\nrequirements and can be grown on defined media. These organisms are the chief concern \\nto man because all the parasites or pathogens of man, animals and plants are \\nchemoheterotrophs.

In simple \\nwords, they remove electrons from inorganic substrates such as hydrogen gas, hydrogen \\nsulfide, sulphur or iron and combine them with carbon dioxide and hydrogen. This \\nreaction provides simple organic molecules and a modest amount of energy to drive the \\nsynthetic processes of the cell. \\nThe chemolithotrophs extract electrons from an inorganic energy source and then \\nuse the electrons to generate ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Molecular oxygen \\ngenerally serves as the terminal electron acceptor. The amount of energy gained in \\nmetabolism depends on the energy source and the terminal electron acceptor. \\nANOXYGENIC PHOTOTROPHIC BACTERIA \\nPlants, algae and cyanobacteria which carry out oxygenic photosynthesis use water \\nas the source of electrons and produce oxygen as a product. The earliest photosynthesizing \\norganisms were likely anoxygenic phototrophs. These use hydrogen sulfide or organic \\ncompounds rather than water as a source of electrons when making reducing power in \\nthe form of NADPH, and therefore they do not generate 02\\' They produce an oxidized \\norganic compound or an oxidized form of sulphur, usually elemental sulphur (5) as an \\nend product. Modern anoxygenic phototrophs are a phylogenetically diverse group of \\nbacteria that inhabit a restricted ecological niche that provides adequate light penetration \\nyet little or no 02; most often, they are found in aquatic habitats such as bogs, lakes \\nand the upper layer of muds. \\nThe photosynthetic systems of the anoxygenic phototrophs are fundamentally \\ndifferent from those of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. They have a unique type of \\nchlorophyll called bacteriochlorophyll. This pigment absorbs wave lengths of light that \\npenetrate to greater depths and are not used by other photosynthetic organisms. By \\nproducing elemental sulphur as a by-product of their photosynthesis, anoxygenic \\nphototrophic bacteria probably caused the huge deposits of elemental sulphur that occur \\nin various parts of the world. Certain lakes in North Africa are now to be in the process \\nof forming new sulphur deposits. They contain large populations of anoxygenic phototrophs, \\nand their bottoms are covered with elemental sulphur. \\nThese bacteria are deeply coloured-red, orange, purple and bright green, because \\nof the chlorophyll and accessory photosynthetic pigments they contain. Water samples \\nfrom deep regions of lakes with an abundance of these organisms are also intensely \\ncolored. \\nPhysiologically, these bacteria carry out photosynthesis anaerobically. The anaerobic \\nphotosynthetic bacteria typically occur in aquatic habitats, often growing at the sediment\\xad\\nwater interface of shallow lakes where there is sufficient light penetration to permit \\nphotosynthetic activity, anaerobic conditions are sufficient to permit the existence of these\\' \\norganisms, and there is a source of reduced sulphur or organic compounds to act as \\nelectron donors for the generation of reduced coenzymes.310 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nTABLE 8 \\nCharacteristics of the Major Groups of Phototrophic Bacteria \\nMetabolism Taxonomic group Photosynthetic pigments Electron donors Carbon source \\nAnoxygenic Purple bacteria Bacteriochlorophyll a or b, H2,H 2S,S Organic C or \\nphotosynthesis carotenoids CO 2 \\nAnoxygenic Green bacteria Bacteriochlorophyll a or b, H 2,H2S,S CO 2 \\nphotosynthesis Carotenoids \\nOxygenic Cyanobacteria Chlorophyll a, ~O CO 2 \\nphotosynthesis* phycobiliproteins \\nOxygenic Prochloro bacteria Chlorophyll a + b, ~O CO 2 \\nphotosynthesis J3-carotenes \\nPurple Halobacterium + Bacteriorhodospin Organic C \\nmembrane \\nmediated \\n* Under some conditions, photosynthesis is anoxygenic, and ~S serves as the electron donor. \\n+ A nonautotrophic archaebacterium \\nThe anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria include the Rhodospirillaceae (purple \\nnonsulphur bacteria), Chromatiaceae (purple sulphur bacteria), Chlorobiaceae (green \\nsulphur bacteria), and Cloroflexaceae (green flexibacteria). \\nMembers of the family Chromatiaceae produce carotenoid pigments and may appear \\norange-brown, red-brown, purple-red, or purple-violet. They deposit elemental sulphur as \\na consequence of their utilization of reduced sulphur compounds as electron donors for \\ngenerating reducing power. Because of their colour and sulphur metabolism, the \\nChromatiaceae are called the purple sulphur bacteria. In all but one genus of organisms \\nwithin this large family, the sulphur accumulates intracellularly. Members of the \\nChromatiaceae are potentially mixotrophic, that is, they are capable of photoautotrophic \\nand heterotrophic growth, and all strains are capable of photoassimilating simple organic \\nsubstrates such as acetate. The cells of Chromatium, ThiOCljStis, Thiosarcina, Thiospirillum \\nand 171iocapsa do not contain gas vacuoles, but some genera of the family Chromatiaceae, \\nsuch as 171iodichjoll and Thiopedia, do contain gas vacuoles that permit an adjustment \\nof cell buoyancy in a water column to a depth appropriate for light intensity and oxygen \\nconcentration, making anaerobic photosynthetic metabolism possible. \\nThe Chlorobiaceae produce green or green-brown carotenoid pigments and are \\nobligately phototrophic. They assimilate carbon dioxide, utilizing sulfide or elemental \\nsulphur as electron donors, and they deposit sulphur granules extracellularly. Because \\nof their colour and sulphur metabolism, the Chlorobiaceae are called the green sulphur \\nbacteria. All members of the Chlorobiaceae are nonmotile. These bacteria often occur in \\necological situations similar to those of the Chromatiaceae. \\nThe Rhodospirillaceae generally produce red-purple carotenoid pigments. Three \\ngenera are recognized: Rhodospirillum has spiral-shaped cells; Rhodopseudomonas hasGRAM -ve BACTERIA 311 \\nspherical or rod-shaped cells that do not form filaments; and exhibit budding division. \\nMembers of the genera Rhodospirillum and Rhodopseudomonas are motile by means of polar \\nflagella, whereas those of the genus RllOdomicrobium are peritrichously flagellated. Their \\nphotosynthetic development depends on the ability of the cells to photo assimilate simple \\norganic compounds. When sulfide or thiosulfate is utilized as an electron donor, elemental \\nsulphur is not deposited within the cell. The organic substrates utilized by the \\nRhodospirillaceae may serve as electron donors for generating reducing power or may \\nbe photoassimilated. Because they generally require preformed organic matter for growth \\nand are able to utilize light energy for generating ATP, the type of metabolism they carry \\nout is sometimes referred to as photoheterotrophic metabolism and the organisms are \\ncalled the purple nonsulfur bacteria. \\nIn the light under anaerobic conditions, typical members of the Rhodospirillaceae \\nuse molecular hydrogen or sulfide as an electron donor and can grow without organic \\ncompounds. As such, these organisms may be viewed as photoheterotrophs or as \\nphotoautotrophs, generally requiring organic growth factor compounds. Indeed, most \\nstrains in the Rhodospirillaceae require one or more vitamins. Clearly, the Rhodospirillaceae \\noccupy a boundary position between autotrophs and heterotrophs. The basic metabolic \\npathways of the Rhodospirillaceae are the same as those of other autotrophic \\nmicroorganisms. Their ability to assimilate organic compounds and the requirement of \\nmany members of the Rhodospirillaceae for such compounds establish the resemblance \\nof these organisms to heterotrophs. \\nOXYGENIC PHOTOTROPHIC BACTERIA \\n} \\nOxygenic photosynthetic bacteria are called oxyphotobacteria. Two orders are \\ncontained in this group of the oxygenic phototrophic bacteria. Cyanobacteriales and \\nProchlorales. Both of these orders occupy intermediate position between the phototrophic \\nbacteria and the eukaryotic algae, indicating a probable evolutionary link to these higher \\nphotosynthetic organisms. The primary photosynthetic pigment in both cases is chlorophyll \\na, but prochlorophytes also possess chlorophyll b, making them very similar to the green \\nalgae. Presumably, the prochlorobacteria are more closely related to the green algae than \\nare the cyanobacteria. Clearly, there is a phylogenetic relationship among the photosynthetic \\norganisms, with the Oxyphotobacteria occupying an intermediate position between the \\nAnoxyphotobacteria and the algae. Cyanobacteria, thought to be the earliest oxygenic \\nphototrophs. These are photosynthetic organisms that use water as a source of electrons \\nfor reducing power, liberating 02\\' \\n6C0 2 + 6H 20 ~ C 6H 120 6 + 602 \\nThey are about the same size and shape as some algae, and they do produce oxygen \\nas algae do. But cyanobacteria are prokaryotes. They have an outer membrane and a thin \\npeptidoglycan wall typical of gram-negative bacteria. \\nToday cyanobacteria still play an essential role in the biosphere. As primary \\nproducers, they harvest the energy of sunlight, using it to convert CO 2 into organic \\ncompounds. They were initially thought to be a form of algae and were called blue green \\nalgae until electron microscopy revealed their prokaryotic structure.312 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nTHE CYANOBACTERIA \\nThe cyanobacteria are a diverse group of more than 60 genera of gram-negative \\nbacteria. They inhabit a wide range of environments, including fresh water and marine \\nhabitats, soils and the surfaces of rocks. Some cyanobacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen. \\nThey obtain their carbon (as CO 2) as well as their nitrogen (as N 2) from the atmosphere. \\nCyanobacteria being photosynthetic, many are able to convert nitrogen gas (N2) to \\nammonia, which can then be incorporated into cell material. In addition they need only \\na few minerals and a light source to grow. Cyanobacteria are the major nitrogen-fixers \\nin nature. \\nCHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF CYANOBACTERIA \\nCyanobacteria are morphologically diverse. They are tough but flourish in almost \\nall environments-oceans, lakes, streams and soil. Some genera are unicellular with typical \\nprokaryotic shapes such as cocci, rods and spirals. Others form filamentous multicellular \\nassociations called trichomes, they mayor may not be enclosed within a sheath, a tube \\nthat holds and surrounds a chain of cells. Motile trichomes glide as a unit. Cyanobacteria \\nthat inhabit aquatic environments often have gas vesicles, enabling them to move vertically \\nwithin the water column. When large numbers of buoyant cyanobacteria accumulate in \\nstagnant lakes or other fresh water habitats, they may form mats on the surface. In the \\nbright, hot conditions of summer, these cells lyse and decay, creating an odiferous scum \\ncalled a nuisance bloom. \\n~ \\n~ \\no \\no \\nCD \\nGloeobacter Synechococcus \\nDermocarpa \\nSpirulina \\nOscillatoria \\n~ I:··~; W .~: \\nGloeothece Gloeocapsa \\nClli:;l I ~ no \\nAnabaena \\nCylindrospermum \\nCalothrix \\nFig. 6 : CyanobacteriaGRAM -ve BACfERIA 313 \\nThe photosynthetic systems of the cyanobacteria are like those contained within the \\nchloroplasts of algae and plants. In addition to light harvesting chlorophyll pigments, \\ncyanobacteria have phycobiliproteins. These pigments absorb energy from wave lengths \\nof light that are not well absorbed by chlorophyll. They contribute to the blue green algae, \\nor sometimes reddish, colour of the cyanobacteria. \\nNitrogen fixing Cyanobacteria \\nThese bacteria are ~ritically important ecologically. Because they can incorporate \\nboth N2 and CO 2 into organic material, they generate a form of these organisms. Thus, \\ntheir activities can ultimately support the growth of a wide range of organisms in \\nenvironments that would otherwise be devoid of usable nitrogen and carbon. \\nNitrogenase, the enzyme complex that mediates the process of nitrogen fixation, is \\ndestroyed by 02; therefore, nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria must protect the enzyme from \\nthe 02 they generate. Species of Anabaena, which are filamentous, isolate nitrogenase by \\nconfining the process of nitrogen fixation to a specialized thick walled cell called a \\n\\'heterocyst\\'. Heterocysts are not photosynthetic and, consequently, do not generate 02\\' \\nThe heterocysts of some species form at very regular intervals within the filaments, \\nreflecting the ability of cells within a trichome to communicate. \\nOne species of Anabaena, A. azolIae, forms an intimate relationship with the water \\nfern Azolla. The bacterium grows and fixes nitrogen within the protected environment of \\na special sac in the fern, providing Azolla with a source of available nitrogen. SYllec1lOcocCllS \\nspecies, which are unicellular, fix nitrogen only in the dark. Consequently, nitrogen \\nfixation and photosynthesis are temporally separated. \\nFilamentous cyanobacteria appear to be responsible for maintaining the structure \\nand productivity of soils in cold desert areas such as the Colorado Plateau. Theil\\' sheaths \\npersist in soil, creating a sticky fibrous network that prevents erosion. In addition these \\nbacteria provide an important source of nitrogen and organic carbon in otherwise nutrient \\npoor soils. \\nThe Prochlorales \\nThe prochlorales are similar to the cyanobacteria except that they also synthesize \\nchlorophyll b. Although they originally were considered to be cyanbacteria, their unique \\nability as prokaryotes to produce chI. b is now considered significant enough to separate \\nthem into their own order. The only known genus, Proc1zloroll, occurs as single celled, \\nextracellular symbionts of marine invertebrates. These bacteria appear bright green on the \\nsurface of the animals with which they are associated. Various species of Proc111oron have \\nbeen recognized in field studies, but until the organisms are grown in pure culture, the \\nvalidity of these species remains ambiguous. \\nTHE PURPLE BACTERIA \\nThe purple bacteria are a small group of gram-negative eubacteria. They are \\nunicellular and reproduce by binary fission or, in a few species by budding. Most are \\nmotile by flagella; a few are immotile. Purple bacteria contain pigments on thylakoids, \\nbut they are different from the cyanobacteria in that they contain a special type of314 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nchlorophyll called bacteriochlorophyll, they do not give off oxygen, and they live in \\nhabitats that lack oxygen. These bacteria are named for their predominant colors. They \\nexist as single cells of many different shapes, and are frequently motile. These bacteria \\nutilize sulphur compounds in their metabolism, and some may deposit intracellular \\ngranules of sulphur or sulfates. These organisms live in various aqueous habitats, \\nincluding sulphur springs, fresh water lakes and swamps. \\nAll purple bacteria are, at least potentially photoautotrophs, capable of growing \\nanaerobically in the light with CO 2 as the carbon source and reduced inorganic \\ncompounds as the electron donor. Under these conditions, the Calvin-Benson cycle is the \\nprincipal pathway of carbon assimilation. However, the purple bacteria can also develop \\nphotoheterotrophically under anaerobic conditions in the light at the expense of organic \\ncompounds, of which acetate is the most widely utilized. \\n~. \\n~ CI \\n~~O \\n~ Ch~omatium \\n@~ \\n~~ \\n- Thiocystis oj \\nb,ac~ \\n.

Purple \\nbacteria are photosynthetic, they use light as a source of energy and carbon dioxide as \\ntheir chief source of carbon. \\nPurple Sulphur Bacteria \\nPurple sulphur bacteria can sometimes be seen growing as colored masses in \\nsulphur-rich habitats such as sulphur springs. The cells are relatively large, sometimes \\nin excess of 5 Jlm in diameter, and some are motile by flagella. They may also have gas \\nvesicles, which enable them to move up or down to their preferred level in the water \\ncolumn. The purple bacteria, such as Chromatium, also use sulphur, sulphur compounds \\nor hydrogen gas to reduce carbon dioxide. They are distinguished from the green bacteria \\nby their type of chlorophyll, location of stored sulphur and ribosomal RNA. \\nMany species of purple sulphur bacteria are strict anaerobes and phototrophs, but \\nsome can grow in absence of light aerobically, oxidizing reduced inorganic or organic \\ncompounds as a source of energy. Representative genera of purple sulphur bacteria include \\nChromatium, Thiospirillum, and TlziodichJon. \\nPurple Non-Sulphur Bacteria \\nThe purple non-sulphur bacteria are found in a wide variety of aquatic habitats, \\nincluding moist soils, bogs and swampy areas. One important characteristic that \\ndistinguishes them from the purple sulphur bacteria is that they preferentially use a variety \\nof organic molecules rather than hydrogen sulfide as a source of electrons for reducing \\npower. Purple non sulphur bacteria are remarkably versatile metabolically. Most purple316 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nnon-sulphur bacteria can grow aerobically in the absence of light using chemotrophic \\nmetabolism.

In some cases, the cellular extensions have a reproductive function, but \\nin others they have a physiological purpose. Several budding bacteria, such as \\nRhodomicrobium, are associated primarily with other groups on the basis of their characteristic \\nmodes of nutrition. The stalked bacteria live attached to the surface of objects in aquatic \\nenvironments. Budding is the term applied to the mode of multiplication that is \\ncharacteristic for the budding yeasts. Contrary to binary fission, it is an unequal cell \\nQ \\nDeveloping bud \\nFig. 9 : Type of budding bacteriaGRAM -ve BACTERIA 319 \\ndivision which proceeds via localized growth. The daughter cell or bud is usually smaller \\nthan the mother cell and reaches normal size only after it has become separated from \\nthe mother cell. The bud breaks off, enlarges, develops a flagellum and swarms to another \\narea to start its own cycle. These bacteria can also grow in very low nutrient habitats. \\nOne type can even grow in distilled water or tap water. \\nThe budding and appendaged bacteria represent a heterogenous group on the basis \\nof a particular morpholgical feature. In some cases, the cellular extensions have a \\nreproductive function, but in others they have a physiological purpose. \\nBudding and append aged bacteria occur in all nutritional categories. Members of \\nthe genus Galliollella are capable of chemolithotrophic metabolism; they are probably \\nfacultatively chemolithotrophic because they oxidize ferrous to ferric iron and fix carbon \\ndioxide. Galliollella are sometimes considered to be sheathed bacteria because their \\'stalks\\' \\nmay be covered with iron hydroxide. The growth of Galliollella species often causes \\nproblems in iron pipes of water delivery systems. \\nTABLE 13 \\nBudding and Appendaged Bacteria \\nDescription Genus \\nProsthecate bacteria \\nProsthecate with reproductive function; from new cells by budding Hyplzomicrobillnl \\nHypllOnlOllaS \\nProsthecate with no reproductive function \\nNonprosthecate bacteria-Reproduce by budding \\nBacteria with exreted appendages and holdfasts \\nReproduce by binary fission only \\nReproduce by budding \\nGenera of uncertain affiliation \\nPedomicrobium \\nTliiodelldroll \\nCaulobacter \\nAsticcacaulis \\nAllcalomicrobi1l11l \\nProstlzecobacter \\nPros tlzecomicrobill1n \\nStella \\nPasteuria \\nBlastobacter \\nSeliberia \\nGalliollella \\nNevskia \\nPlanctomyces \\nMetallogenium \\nCaulococcus \\nKusnezovia320 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe cell appendages of the bacteria in this group, known as prosthecae, provide \\ngreater efficiency in concentratiJ.lg available nutrients.

To illustrate the variations in G + \\nC ratio, the genus Streptococcus has a low G + C content of 33-34% and the genus \\nClostridium has a low content of 21-54%. \\nBy contrast, filamentous actinomycetes of the genus Streptomyces have a high G + \\nC content of 69-73%. Gram-positive bacteria of a more conventional morphology, such \\nas the genera Conjllebacterillm and Mycobacterium, have, respectively, a G + C content of \\n51-63% and 62-70%. \\nThe Gram-positive bacteria contain a number of anaerobic or facultatively anaerobic \\norganisms, some of these are members of the actinomycete group, many of them are \\nunicellular bacteria unrelated to the mycelial prokryotes. \\nMany Gram positive bacteria share the ability to form a distinctive type of dormant \\ncell known as an endospore.

One way in which they differ from corynebacteria is \\nthat they are I acid fast\\'. Mycobacteria and nocardia are not decolourised by acid treatment \\nand are designated I acid fast\\'. A few saprophytic mycobacteria can be decolorized with \\nHCI-alcohol, but not with aqueous HC!. The resistance to acid is due to the high levels \\nof mycolic acid in the cell wall, which make the cells of mycobacteria waxlike and strongly \\nhydrophobic. They usually contain granules and vacuoles, they do not form capsules, \\nflagella or spores. \\nMost are strict aerobes that grow well on simple nutrients and media. Compared \\nwith other bacteria, the growth rate is generally slow, with generation times ranging from \\ntwo hours to several days. Some members of the genus exhibit colonies containing yellow, \\norange or pink carotenoid pigments that require light for development, while others are \\nnon pigmented. \\nWorldwide, millions of people are afflicted with tuberculosis and leprosy; certain \\nopportunistic species loosely grouped into a category called MOTI (Mycobacteria other \\nthan the tubercle bacillus) have become an increasing problem in immunosuppressed \\npatients. \\nCorynebacterium, Mycobacterium and Nocardia exhibit a number of similar features in \\ntheir cell wall composition, as well as differences. Their murein skeleton resembles that \\nof the gram-negative bacteria, but it is complexed with an arabinogalactan, a polysaccharide \\nconsisting of arabinose and galactose. This is bound to lipids, namely, mycolic acids. \\nMycolic acids are branched hydroxyl acids (R\\' -CHOH-CHR 2-COOH) carrying aliphatic \\nchain substituents in position 2 and 3. \\nMYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS \\nThe Tubercle Bacillus \\nMycobacterium tuberculosis is the pathogen causing tuberculosis in human beings and \\nwas described by R. Koch in 1882, the tubercle bacillus is a long, thin rod that grows \\nin sinuous masses or strands called cords. It produces no exotoxins or enzymes that \\ncontribute to infectiousness. Most strains contain complex waxes and a cord factor. \\nCulture of Mycobacterium \\nSimple synthetic media: Large inocula grow on simple media in several weeks. \\nSmall inocula fail to grow in such media because of 1he presence of minute amounts of \\ntoxic fatty acids. The toxic effect of fatty acids can be neutralized by animal serum or \\nalbumin, and the fatty acids may then actually promote growth. Activated charcoal aids \\ngrowth. \\nOleic acid-albumin media: May support the proliferation of small inocula, particularly \\nif Tweens (water-soluble esters of fatty acids) are present (e.g. Dubos\\' medium). Ordinarily, \\nmycobacteria grow in clumps or masses because of the hydrophobic character of the cell \\nsurface. Tweens wet the surface and thus permit dispersed growth in liquid media. Growth \\nis often more rapid than on complex media.GRAM +ve BACTERIA 323 \\nComplex organic media: Small inocula, e.g., samples from patients, are grown on \\nmedia containing complex organic substances, e.g. egg yolk, animal serum, tissue extracts. \\nThese media often contain penicillin or malachite green (e.g. Lowenstein-Jensen medium) \\nto inhibit other bacteria. . \\nGrowth Characteristics \\nMycobacteria are obligate aerobes and derive energy from the oxidation of many \\nsimple carbon compounds. Increased CO 2 tension enhances growth. Biochemical activities \\nare not characteristic, and the growth rate is much slower than that of most bacteria. The \\ndoubling time of tubercle bacilli is 12 hours or more. Saprophytic forms tend to,grow mote \\nrapidly, proliferate well at 22°C, produce more pigment, and be less acid-fast than \\npathogenic forms. \\nResponse to Physical and Chemical Agents \\nMycobacteria tend to be more resistant to chemical agents that other bacteria because \\nof the hydrophobic nature of the cell surface and their clumped growth. Dyes (e.g. \\nmalachite green) or antibacterial agents (e.g. penicillin) that are bacteriostatic to other \\nbacteria can be incorporated into media without inhibiting the growth of tubercle bacilli. \\nAcids and alkalies permit the survival of some exposed tubercle bacilli and are used for \\nconcentration of clinical specimens and partial elimination of contaminating organisms. \\nTubercle bacilli are fairly resistant to drying and survive for long periods in dried sputum. \\nVariation: Variation can occur in colony appearance, pigmentation, cord factor \\nproduction, virulence, optimal growth temperature, and many other cellular or growth \\ncharacteristics. \\nSpecies \\nM. tuberculosis \\nM. bovis \\nM. kansasii \\nM. avium-intracellulare \\nM. fortuitum-dle/onel \\nM.leprae \\nPATHOGENICITY \\nTABLE 1 \\nPathogenicity of Mycobacteria \\nHuman Guinea Pig \\n+++ +++ \\n+++ +++ \\n+++ \\n+ \\n+ \\n++ \\nFowl Cattle \\n+++ \\n+++ \\nThere are marked differences in the ability of different mycobacteria to cause lesions \\nin various host species. \\nMycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis are equally pathogenic for humans. \\nThe route of infection (respiratory versus intestinal) determines the pattern of lesions. In \\ndeveloped countries, M. bovis has become very rare. Some typical mycobacteria (e.g.324 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMycob(lcterium kansasil) produce human disease indistinguishable from tuberculosis; others \\n(e.g., Mycobacterium fortuitum) cause only surface lesions or act as opportunists. \\nConstituents of Tubercle bacilli \\nThe constituents listed below are found largely in cell walls. Mycobacterial cell walls \\ncan induce delayed hypersensitivity, induce some resistance to infection, and replace \\nwhole mycobacterial cells in Freund\\'s adjuvant. Mycobacterial cell contents only elicit \\ndelayed hypersensitivity reactions in previously sensitized animals. \\nLipids: Mycobacteria are rich in lipids. Many complex lipids, fatty acids, and waxes \\nhave been iSolated from them. In the cell the lipids are largely bound to proteins and \\npolysaccharides. Some such complexes have been isolated. Lipids are probably responsible \\nfor most of the cellular tissue reactions to tubercle bacilli. Phosphatide fractions can \\nproduce tubercle like cellular responses and cause necrosis. Lipids are to some extent \\nresponsible for acid-fastness. When mycobacteria are defatted with ether, this staining \\nproperty is lost. Analysis of the lipids by gas chromatography can reveal species-specific \\npatterns that aid in classification. \\nVirulent strains of tubercle bacilli form microscopic serpentine cords in which acid\\xad\\nfast bacilli are arranged in parallel chains. Cord formation is correlated with virulence. \\nA cord factor (trehalose-6, 6\\'-dimycolate) has been extracted from virulent bacilli with \\npetroleum ether. It inhibits migration of leukocytes, causes chronic granulomas, and can \\nserve as an immunologiC adjuvant. \\nProteins: Each type of Mycobacterium contains several proteins that elicit the \\ntuberculin reaction. Proteins bound to a wax fraction can, upon injection, induce tuberculin \\nsensitivity. They can also elicit the formation of a variety of antibodies. \\nPolysaccharides: Mycobacteria contain a variety of polysaccharides. Their role in the \\npathogenesis of disease is uncertain. They can induce the immediate type of hypersensitivity \\nand can interfere with some antigen-antibody reactions in vitro. \\nPathogenesis \\nMycobacteria produce no recognized toxins. Organisms in droplets of 1-5 ~m are \\ninhaled and reach alveoli. The disease results from establishment and proliferation of \\nvirulent organisms and interactions with the host. Virulent bacilli (e.g. BCG) survive only \\nfor months or years in the normal host. Resistance and hypersensitivity of the host greatly \\ninfluence the development of the disease. \\nPathology: The production and development of lesions \\nOther Mycobacteria \\nIn addition to tubercle bacilli (M tuberculosis, M bovis), other Mycobacteria of varying \\ndegrees of pathogenicity have been grown from human sources in past decades. These \\natypical mycobacteria were initially grouped according to speed of growth at various \\ntemperatures and production of pigments.GRAM +ve BACfERIA 325 \\nMycobacterium \\na-Nocardia \\n~-Nocardia \\nDermatophilus Streptomyces \\nActinoplanes Streptosporanaium \\nFig. 1 : Mycobacteria, Nocardia and Actinomyces326 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nA few species or complexes that are significant in medicine are outlined below: \\nMycobacterium kansasii: M. kansasii is a photochromogen that requires complex \\nmedia for growth at 3\\'?C. It can produce pulmonary and systemic diseaSe indistinguishable \\nfrom tuberculosis, especially in patients with impaired immune responses. Sensitive to \\nrifampin, it is often treated with rifampin + ethambutol + INH with good clinical response. \\nThe source of infection is uncertain, and communicability is low or absent. \\nMycobacterium avium-intracellular complex: The members of this group grow \\noptimally at 41°C and produce smooth, soft colonies with little colour. Able to infect birds, \\nthey cause spontaneous human disease infrequently. Infection with M. intracellular, \\nhowever, is common in the southeastern USA, where the organisms occurs in soil and \\nwater, and results in skin test reactions to PPD-B. Overt pulmonary disease occurs mainly \\nin immuno-deficient persons. Resistance to antituberculosis drugs is common, and disease \\ndue to this organism requires treatment with rifampin + ethambutol + streptomycin or \\ncycloserine for many months. \\nMycobacterium scrofulaceum: This is a scotochromogen, occasionally found in water \\nand as a saprophyte in adults with chronic lung disease. It is the commonest cause of \\nchronic cervical lymphadenitis in small children and rarely causes other granulomatous \\ndisease. Surgical excision of involved cervical lymphadenitis in small children and rarely \\ncauses othe~ granulomatous disease. Surgical excision of involved cervical lymph nodes \\nmay be curative, whereas resistance to antituberculosis drugs is common. Occasionally, \\ninfection responds to combined treatment with INH + rifampin + streptomycin or \\ncycloserine. \\nMycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium ulcerans: These organisms occur in \\nwater, grow best at low temperature (31°C), may infect fish, and can produce superficial \\nskin lesions (ulcers, swimming pool granulomas) in humans. Surgical excision, tetracyclines, \\nand antituberculosis drugs may be tried in therapy. Mycobacterium fortuitum-chelonei \\nComplex: These are saprophytes found in soil and water that grow very rapidly in vitro \\nand form no pigment. They can produce superficial and systemic disease in humans on \\nrare occasions. M. chelonei has contaminated porcine valves used as prostheses in human \\ncardiac surgery. The organisms are often resistant to commonly used drugs but may be \\nsusceptible to amikacin or doxycycline. \\nENDOSPORE FORMING RODS AND COCCI \\nThe ability to produce more or less heat resistant spores is restricted to a group \\nof gram + ve, motile rods with peritrichous flagella. \\n• Aerobic and facultatively anaerobic rods belong to the genera. Bacillus, \\nSporolactobacillus and Sporosarcina and the anaerobic rods belong to the genera \\nClostridium and Desulfotomaculum. \\n• Aerobic spore formers: The aerobic spore formers live in soil. Many bacilli form \\nchains or filaments. They can be differentiated into the following groups \\naccording to the shape of their spores and vegetative cells. \\n(I) The spores of the majority of bacilli are oval or cylindrical in shape and no widerGRAM +ve BACTERIA 327 \\nthan the vegetative cells (Bacillus megateriu11l, B. cereus, B. subtilis, B. liche1lifonnis, B. a1ltlzracis, \\nB. thuri1lgieusis). \\n(II) The oval spores are wider than the vegetative cells, during sporulation the cells \\nbecome distended (B. polymyxa, B. 11lacerans, B. stearotlzermophilus, B. circllialls). \\n(III) Almost spherical spores in terminally distended vegetative cells (B. pasteurii). \\nB. megaterium: With dimensions of 2 x 5 !lm giant among rod shaped eubacteri\". \\nB. cereus is somewhat smaller.

B. sllbtilis is called hay \\nbacterium because it is easily isolated from hay by enrichment culture, B. liche1liforlllis \\nproduce polypeptide antibiotics. \\nB. poly11lyxa (formerly called B. asterosponls) takes its name from its profuse slime \\nproduction and the star-shaped cross section of its barrel shaped spores. It produces 2, \\n3- butane diol as does B. licheuifonnis. B. stearothermophilus is a thermophilic organism \\nwith an optimum growth temperature of 50-65°C. \\n(III) B. pasteurii is known as classic urea-degrading organism, it produces urease \\nconstitutively, hydrolyses urea to CO 2 and NH3 and is adapted to grow at high ph valups. \\nAnaerobic Spore Formers \\nThey do not need 02 for growth Clostridilllll usually lack cytochromes and catalase \\nmost clostridia contain high levels of flavin enzymes and on contact with air or oxygen, \\nthey form H 20 2 which is toxic to these cells.

It was first recognized by Gasperini in 1890 \\nas potential destroyers of bacteria and fungi. Morphologically, actinomycetes fall between \\nfungi and bacteria (mould like bacteria). In many respects they resemble fungi, and for \\nthat reason they are known as ray fungi. Their filamentous nature, branching pattern, \\nand conidia formation are similar to those of fungi. Their size and spore characters are \\nsimilar to bacteria. Recent detailed studies have brought out clearly that actinomycetes \\nare quite distinct from the fungi and bacteria in many respects. Their natural occurrence \\nis mostly restricted to soils. They are gram + ve and are related to the coryneform bacteria \\nand mycobacteria by an almost conteneous sequence of intermediate form. The actinomycete \\ncolonies are characteristic in several respects. They produce mass of growth to form a \\ncolony, but an actinomycete colony differs from the bacterial colony in that it consist of \\na mass of filamentous threads with spore-bearing hyphae. They consist of vegetative and \\nsporogenous hyphae. The vegetative mycelium is lichinoid and exists below the surface \\nof the agar medium. The colour of the vegetative mycelium may vary, and it may also \\nproduce soluble pigments in the medium. \\nThe aerial mycelium emerges from the vegetative hyphae in the medium. The type \\nof aerial mycelium varies with the genus and species of the actinomycetes. The chief \\ncharacteristics of spore-bearing hyphae are illustrated. The sporogenous hyphae vary in \\nlength and may be formed in chains, whorls, tufts, or in spring. The method of branching \\nof the hyphae also is characteristic of the species, and serves as a basis for speciation \\nof Streptomyces. Actinomycetes produce true conidia or chlamydospores. Due to \\nsegmentation of old hyphae, cylindrical spores are produced. In the case of sporulation, \\nelectron microscopic studies have revealed that the spores are formed within the hyphal \\nwall, the hyphal contents divide simultaneously to form separate dense particles, whichGRAM +ve BACTERIA 331 \\nare transformed into chains. In some species the hyphal wall persists in the form of a \\nsheath, even after the liberation of the spores. The spores may be spherical, oval or \\ncylindrical. On germination of the spores, formation of one or two germ tubes has been \\nreported. From the germ tubes primary hyphae are formed, which give rise to a network \\nof thin mycelium. In the substrate the mycelium is thin, vegetative, and of varying colour. \\nThe growth of actinomycetes on solid or liquid medium results in characteristic colonies \\nor masses. The cells can be readily stained with methyl-violet, carbol-fuchsin or methylene\\xad\\nblue. They are mainly gram-positive and the acid fastness varies with the genera. In some \\nspecies club formation, which is similar to capsule formation in bacteria, has been reported. \\nA few species of actinomycetes have been reported to be motile, but the presence of flagella \\nhas not been conclusively proved. \\nActinophages have been isolated and shown to be specific pathogens for streptomyces. \\nThey resemble bacteriophages in most respects. For this reason, actinomycetes are believed \\nto be closer to bacteria than fungi. \\nNocardia generally forms small circular transparent glistering colonies on gelatin, \\nand round, curved, slightly arborescent or pink colonies on agar media. Aerial mycelium \\nis colourless and irregular. Actinomyces spp. show scanty growth in gelatin, whereas \\nStreptomyces spp. produce grey colonies, sometime with soluble pigmentation. Some \\nstreptomycetes produce punctiform colonies with white aerial mycelium. \\nMicromonospora \\nActtnomyces \\nNocardia \\nWaksmanta \\nThermomonospora Thennopolyspora Thennoactmomyces StreptosporanglUm \\nFig. 2 : Some actinomycetes showing spore bearing hyphae332 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nNocardias are peculiar in their rapid segmentation of the mycelium into irregularly \\nshaped cells, filaments, rods or cocci. This polymorphism has c~used considerable \\nconfusion in the taxonomic literature. In some cases they multiply by budding to produce \\ncolonies similar to those of micrococci. The concentration and segmentation of the \\nprotoplasm in the filaments is commonly observed. In some older cultures, chlamydospores \\nare also seen. Some nocardias exhibit motility at certain stages of their growth. When \\nstained, young nocardias show undifferentiated protoplasm. The conidia are produced \\nsingly at the end of simple or branched conidiophores. Sporangiospores are borne inside \\nthe hyphal strands, and they are usually spherical in shape. The cell wall substance is \\nneither chitin nor cellulose and it is not resistant to desiccation unlike in streptomycetes. \\nActinomyces spp. are pathogenic in many instances, and are anaerobic or \\nmicroaerophilic. They branch in a characteristic angular manner. Their colonies are tough \\nand sometimes diptheroid. \\nStreptomycetes are mostly aerobic and soil-dwellers, except for a few plant pathogenic \\nspecies. Many streptomycetes degrade cellulose, chitin and other recalcitrant natural \\nsubstances. The vegetative mycelium usually does not fragment into bacillary or coccoid \\ncells whereas conidia are borne in sporophores. Typical aerial mycelium is much \\nbranched, and the conidia are formed in chains. The conidia formation patterns broadly \\ndivided into five groups, viz. (a) straight sporulating hyphae. (b) spore-bearing hyphae \\narranged in clusters, (c) spiral formation in aerial mycelium with long and open spirals \\n(d) spiral formation of the aerial mycelium, short and compact, and (e) spore-bearing \\nhyphae arranged on the mycelium in whorls or tufts. In some cases the capacity to produce \\nconidia and aerial mycelium may be lost due to continued culturing in artificial media. \\nMicromollospora spp. are non-septate and thin. They do not form aerial mycelium \\nbut spread well inside the agar medium. The substrate hyphae are branched with cross\\xad\\nwalls and the aerial mycelium is either not formed or rudimentary. They multiply by \\nconidia formation, either singly at the end of special condiophores, which may be \\nbranched, or in clusters. \\nThe genus Waksmmlia (Microbisporn) is characterized by the formation of spores in \\npairs on aerial conidiophores. The mycelium may be substrate or aerial, and the aerial \\nmyceliunl bears spores which are formed in longitudinal pairs. There are four genera \\nwhich comprise the thermophilic group of actinomycetes. They are: (i) Tl1ermomonospora \\nwhich has long aerial hyphae, forming spores singly on simple or branched sporophores; \\n(ii) Tlzenllopolyspora which has long hyphae with spores produced in pairs or long chains; \\n(iii) TIler11loactinolllyces which has spores singly or in chains, originating directly from the \\nsubstrate mycelium. This is thermophilic and occurs as part of the bacterial flora of damp \\nhaystacks and piles of organic waste where heat is generated. Their spore resemble the \\nendospore of Bacillus and Clostridium. (iv) Pseudollocardia which has septate substrate \\nmycelium, with spores formed from both aerial and substrate mycelium. Some species of \\nStreptomyces are also thermophilic and are grouped among the above four genera. Two \\nother genera of actinomycetes which are less commonly known are: (1) Actilloplmles which \\nhave no aerial mycelium, but produce motile sporangiospores inside sporangial bodies, \\nand (2) Streptospormlgiu11I which has aerial mycelium with coiled sporangiophores andGRAM +ve BACTERIA 333 \\nnon-motile sporangiospores formed inside sporangial bodies. There are also several other \\nincompletely described morphological forms of actinomycetes. \\nIt is easy to differentiate primary and secondary mycelia under the micro-scope: \\nsecondary mycelium is thicker and darker in colour; their cells are roughly of the same \\nthickness as bacteria, i.e. 0.6 to 1.8 Ilm. The division is also bacteria-like in most cases. \\nThe cell wall is also gram-positive and some are acid-fast, and the wall is composed of \\nmucopolysaccharides, together with 2 percent lipid, whereas fungi contain chitin, cellulose \\nand lignin. Thus, cytologically actinomycetes resemble bacteria. \\nThe carbon content (45%) of the actinomycetes cell is not much different from that \\nof fungi and bacteria. Actinomycetes have a nitrogen content of 10%, which is more than \\nthat of fungi, and are closer to bacteria. The amino acid content of actinomycetes and \\nbacteria is almost similar. The work on the mycobacteria has shown that 63% of lipid \\nis present in the cell. In other actinomycetes, the aerial mycelium contains more lipid than \\nthe primary or vegetative mycelium. Streptomyces griseus contains 14% lipid, as against \\n4.4 % in Bacillus subtilis. Cellulose and chitin are absent in Streptomyces. \\nWhen treated with 30% KOH, the cell wall of actinomycetes disappears. If cellulose \\nand chitin are present, they are not soluble in 30% KOH. Lysozyme, which is specific \\nfor mucopolysaccharides, can lyse the cell wall of actinomycetes. Besides, hexosamine \\nhas been detected in the cell wall of Streptomyces spp. S. fradiae and S. griseus contain \\n18.48 % and 19.9% hexosamine, respectively, as against 2 to 3 % in Nocardia spp. There \\nis most of hexose in Nocardia than in Streptomyces. The protein contents of Streptomyces \\nand Nocardia have been studied and found to be similar. Arginine, lysine, hexosamine, \\nalanine, valine, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, glutamic acid, diaminopimelic \\nacid, asparagines, etc are the common amino acids found in these proteins. \\nThe dry powdery appearance of the aerial mycelium of actinomycetes, and the \\ndifficulty of wetting the spores appears to be due to the presence of lipids in their cell \\nwalls. In 1954 O.T. Avery and F. Blank reported that representative species of Actinomyces, \\nNocardia, Streptomyces and Micromollospora were all devoid of chitin and cellulose, and \\nthis is indicative of their closer relationship to bacteria than to fungi. Though several \\nscientists attempted to demonstrate the presence of nucleus in actinomycete cells, the first \\nconvincing account came from L. Grigorakis who in 1931 found that in the thallus of \\nActinomyces bovis, the nuclei divided amitotically, whereas in the aerial spores nucleus \\ncould not be demonstrated. By the Feulgen test some scientists found diffused staining \\nof granules in the cells of actinomycets. Some evidence for the presence of discrete nuclei \\nin the spore-bearing mycelium and in conidia has been obtained. \\nStudies on the cell constituents have indicated the presence of several substances \\nof serological specificity. Diaminopimelic acid derivative and glycogen, manopyrannose, \\narbofuranose, amino sugars, rhamnopyrannose, etc and fat bodies have been reported i\\'l \\nthe young mycelia of Nocardia, Streptomyces and Micromonospora. Several known fatty acids \\nand a new one, named nocardic acid in Nocardia asteroides, have been studied. Presence \\nof vacuoles are commonly found.

The presence of certain more or less spherical \\nstructures, believed to be nuclei, has been shown in electron microscopic investigations \\nof Streptomyces griseus. Both nuclear fusion and reduction division are believed to take \\nplace before vegetative growth sets in. Several workers have also observed irregular \\ndistribution of nuclear material in the cell cytoplasm, more than two nuclei in each cell, \\nirregular septation of the mycelium resulting in multinucleate or uninucleate cells, etc. \\nActinomycosis \\nActinomycosis may be defined as the disease caused by Actinomycetes. It has been \\nreported that generally the most affected sites of the body are lungs, jaws and intestine. \\nThe actinomycosis is a chronic pus forming disease caused by the microorganism \\nof the group actinomyces. The disease spreads to surrounding tissue no matter of what \\ntype the tissue may be that means there exists no limitation of anatomical barriers. There \\nmay be a rare hematogenous spread followed by the formation of sinus (enormously \\nexpended vein) tracts that drains suppurative lesions.

Actinomycetes have provided many \\nimportant bioactive compounds of commercial value and continue to be routinely screened \\nfor new bioactive compounds. These searches have been remarkably successful and \\napproximately two thirds of naturally occurring antibiotics including many of medical \\nimportant have been isolated from actinomycetes.GRAM +ve BACTERIA 335 \\nAll over the world scientists screening actinomycetes at various levels for the \\ndiscovery of high value metabolites because of the following major reasons: \\n• Excellent tract record \\n• Chemical diversity \\n• Chemical surprise \\n• Inherent biological activity \\nAccessing microbial biosynthetic diversity has historically involved the isolation \\nand cultivation of chemically prolific taxa, of those now recognized as such bacteria with \\nin the order actinomycetales. The value of actinomycetes to society in terms of providing \\nuseful drugs, especially antibiotics and anticancer agents and to the pharmaceutical \\nindustry for revenue generating discovery platform, is indisputable. Actinomycete \\ncompounds or derivatives there of accounted for approximately two thirds of the naturally \\noccurring antibiotics as of 1988, making them one of the single most important sources \\nof prescription drugs. These bacteria, which are best known from soils, have been the \\nfocus of aggressive research efforts since the discovery of actinomycin in 1940 from \\nActinomyces antibioticus by Selman Waksman at Rutgers University. Additional actinomycete \\nproducts such as antibiotics like streptomycin and novobiocin and firmly cemented these \\nchemically prolific bacteria in the centre stage of natural products drug discovery research \\n(Jenson et al., 2003). \\nSo many high value metabolites (both primary and secondary metabolites) of \\ncommercial importance have been produced by cultivation of members of this group for \\nthe past 50-60 years and new compounds are discovered, patented and marketed every \\nyear. A search for recent literature revealed that at least 4,607 patents have been issued \\non actinomycete related productS and processes (Labeda and Shearer, 1990). Out of 22,500 \\ntotal bioactive secondary metabolites 10,100 (45%) are reported to produced from \\nactinomycetes (7630 from Streptomycetes and 2470 from rare actinomycetes). The number \\nof bioactive compounds produced from common actinomycetes and the group of compound \\nproduced are presented in table 3 & 4. \\nTABLE 3 \\nNumber of Bioactive Compounds Produced from Common Actinomycetes \\nGenus 1974 1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2005 \\nStreptomyces 1934 2784 3477 4877 5645 6600 7630 \\nMicromollospora 41 129 269 398 492 535 740 \\nActinomadura 0 16 51 164 248 315 345 \\nStreptoverticillium 19 41 64 168 169 244 258 \\nNocardia 45 74 107 262 270 287 357 \\nActinoplanes 6 40 95 146 169 195 248 \\nStreptosporangium 7 20 26 39 57 66 79336 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nTABLE 4 \\nMajor Groups of Bioactive Secondary Metabolites \\nType of activity Actinomycetes Fungi Other bacteria Total \\nPharmacologically / \\nImmunologically active agents 230 750 80 1060 \\nEnzyme inhibitors 380 150 40 570 \\nPhytotoxins/Herbicides 80 380 50 510 \\nPesticides 360 85 10 455 \\nMicrobial regulators 30 30 20 80 \\nOther active agents 320 2305 700 3325 \\nTotal number 1400 3700 900 6000 \\nAntibiotics 8700 4900 2900 16,500 \\nBioactive microbial secondary \\nmetabolites (total) 10100 8600 3800 22,500 \\nThe secondary metabolites produced by actinomycetes possess different kinds of \\nactivity. The secondary metabolites are very complex in structure it needs so many enzymes \\nfor its synthesis. For example nearly 30 different enzymes are involved in the synthesis \\nof the antibiotic streptomycin. Such kind of complex synthesis is not easy to carry out \\nchemically and another important point is a single secondary metabolite may exhibit \\ndifferent activity. Avermectin-a secondary metabolite produced by Streptomyces avermetilis \\nwhich showed antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic and insecticidal activity. Another \\nexample is the ascomycin was reported in 1962 as an antifungal antibiotic produced by \\nS. hygroscopicus var. ascomyceticus. The later study showed that this culture produces \\nimmunosuppressive activity and further analysis revealed that ascomycin is composed \\nof two compounds that is FR900520 and FR900523, related to the immunosuppressive \\nFK506 (Hatanaka et al., 1988) which is produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis. This kind \\nof surprising activity exhibited by actinomycete compounds is one of the reasons for the \\nstanding of actinomycetes among the various kinds of industrial important microorganisms. \\nAntibiotics from Actinomycetes \\nSecondary metabolism and secondary metabolite production is a parental character \\nof actinomycetes which are produced at the end of the stationary phase (idiophase) and \\nare not necessary for the growth of actinomycetes. Antibiotic is one of the major secondary \\nmetabolite produced by most actinomycetes which confers the antagonistic properties to \\nit. The antibiotics include antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic and antihelminthic \\nagents. Most actinomycetes produce chemically diverse group of bioactive compounds \\nincluding antibiotics with inherent biological activity. It is difficult to produce which \\ngenera of actinomycete produce specific chemical group of antibiotics. Another important \\npoint to remember is the antibiotic (secondary metabolite) production is not a genus orGRAM +ve BACTERIA 337 \\nspecies specific, it is strictly a strain 5 specific process. But if one is interested in specific \\nclass of compounds, it is useful to have some background knowledge which is produced \\nby strains of specific genera (Table 5). But it is not true in all the cases (Labeda and Shearer, \\n1990). A novel antiviral agent, fattiviracin FV-8, purified from the culture broth of \\nstreptomyces microflavus strain No. 2445, was reported to have potent antiviral activities \\nagainst human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-l), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-\\n1) varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and influenza A and B viruses (Habib et al., 2001). \\nTABLE 5 \\nSome of the Major Class of Antibiotics and their Producing Actinomycete Genera \\nChemical class of antibiotic \\nAminoglycosides \\nMacrolide and ansamacroIide \\nOepsipeptide \\nPolvether ionophores \\nActinomycete \\nStreptomyces \\nMicromollospora \\nActilloplmles \\nActinomadura \\n000EUKARYOTA \\nAll living cells can be divided into two groups, prokaryotes and eukaryotes, based \\non their ultra structure as seen with the EM. In the microbial world, bacteria, cyanobacteria \\nare prokaryotes. Other cellular microbes-fungi (yeast & molds) protozoa, algae are \\neukaryotes. The eukaryotic cell is a complex compartmentalized unit that differ from the \\nprokaryotic cell in containing a definite nucleus and several other specialized structures \\nlike cell organelles. Although exact cell structures differ somewhat among the several \\ngroups of eukaryotic organisms, the eukaryotic cell is the typical cell of certain microbial \\ngroups (fungi, algae, protozoans and helminth worms) as well as animal and plants. \\nThe term eukaryotes (from the greek-true nucleus) have linear structures of DNA \\ncalled chromosomes. These are associated with chromosomal proteins called histone \\nprotein. These chromosome are found in the cell\\'s nucleus, which is separated from the \\ncytoplasm by a nuclear membrane. Eukaryotes also have a mitotic apparatus (various \\ncellular structure that participate in a type of nuclear division called mitotis). \\nEvidence from paleobotany indicates that the first eukaryotic cells appeared on earth \\napproximately two billion yrs ago. -One appealing theory suggest that these cells evolved \\nfrom prokaryotic organism by a process of intracellular symbiosis. The structure of these \\nnew cells was so versatile that eukaryotic microorganism soon spread out into available \\nhabitats and adopted greatly diverse styles of living. \\nThe first primitive eukaryote were probably single celled and independent, but over \\ntime, some forms began to aggregate, forming colonies. With further evolution some of \\nthe cells, \",ithin the colonies become specialized or adopted to perform particular function \\nadvantageous to whole colony such as locomotion, feeding or reproduction. \\nAt some point as individual cells in the organism lost the ability to survive apart \\nfrom the intact colony, the scene was set for the development of more complex multicellularEUKARYOTA 339 \\norganism. A multicellular organism is more than just an assemblage of cell like a colony \\nbut it is composed of distinct groups of cells that can\\'t exist independently of rest of the \\nbody. The cell grouping of multicellular organism that have a specific function are termed \\ntissues, and groups of tissues make up organs. \\nAll protozoa, algae, fungi live a unicellular or colonial existence. Truly multicellular \\norganism are found only among plants and animals and some of the fungi and algae. \\nOnly certain eukaryotes are small enough to fall into the realm of microbiology, the \\nprotozoa, fungi and algae. The fungi, algae, and protozoa are the eukaryotic microorganism \\nevolved along three distinct lines of nutrient, cellular and energy acquisition. The fungi \\nabsorb nutrients from host or are parasitic or saprophytic. The algae carry out \\nphotosynthesis to form cellular ATP. Protozoa acquire nutrients and energy through \\ningestion of organic compounds often using phagocytosis to bring nutrients into the cell. \\nFungi typically form filamentous mycelia but one group the yeast are characteristically \\nunicellular. The fungi are classified largely on the basis of their modes of reproduction. \\nThe sexual spores of fungi are the most important features used in classification and \\nidentification of fungi. \\nThe algae are classified largely on the basis of pigment production and biochemical \\nnature of reserve food material. \\nThe protozoa are classified largely on their modes of locomotion. \\nNext following headings contain a generalized survey of principal eukaryotic micro \\norganism viz. - algae, fungi, slime molds, protozoa etc. \\nALGAE \\nAlgae comprise a group of chlorophyll containing thalloid plants of the simplest \\ntype, having no true roots, stems, leaves or leaf like organs. They are placed in the division \\nThallophyta along with fungi. They differ from fungi in the presence of chlorophyll \\n(photosynthetic pigment) and in their mode of nutrition. Although most of the algae are \\nautotrophic, i.e. they synthesize their food by themselves, yet heterotrophic and holozoic \\nforms are not uncommon. The term algae is used even if the plant is a unicellular. The \\nthallus is non-vascular and thus has no elements for the transport of fluids. The algae \\ncan afford this simplicity because with only a few exceptions they are water dwellers. \\nThey have non jacketed, either unicellular sexorgans or multicellular in which every cell \\nproduce a gamete. Most of them are among the simplest in the plant kingdom. \\nGeneral Characters \\n1. Mostly aquatic (marine & fresh) \\nDiverse habitats-below the soil level, moist rocks, wet logs, snow etc. \\n2. Variety of pigments are present. \\n3. Simple thalloid plant body. \\n4. Vascular system is absent. \\n5. Mechanical tissue is absent.340 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n6.

In multicellular sex organs every cell of the thallus is capable of producing \\ngametes. \\n10. Sexual reproduction is of isogamous, anisogamous, or oogamous type. \\n11. Under favourable conditions algae multiplies asexually. \\n12. After gametic fusion, no embryo formed. \\n13. Haploid and diploid life cycles are independent i.e. distinct alternation of \\ngeneration is present. \\nHABIT & HABIT AT \\nThe algae are predominantly aquatic and are found in fresh water or salt water \\nreservoirs. Some are terrestrial and grow in wet conditions, such as, on damp soil, damp \\nshaded sides of trees and walls or even rocks and thus have adopted themselves to a \\nlife in the air. \\n1.

The prokaryotic cells which constitute thalli of cyanophytes (blue-green algae) \\nhave a cell wall which contains a specific strengthening component not found in the cell \\nwalls of other algae. It is mucopeptide. The DNA material representing the nuclear body346 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nconsists of fibrils which may extend throughout the cell or are concentrated in the central \\npart. The mitotic figures are also lacking. The chlorophyll pigment is bound to photosynthetic \\nlamellae or thylakoids which may be arranged in parallel layers in the periphery of the \\ncytoplasm or form a network extending throughout the cell cytoplasm. They are not \\norganized into grana. The chloroplasts are thus absent and so are the mitochondria, golgi \\nbody and endoplasmic reticulum. The ribosomes are, however, present. The nuclear \\ndivision does not take place by mitosis and no cell plate is formed instead there is a ring \\nlike extension of the cell wall. It extends in wards like a diaphragm with decreasing \\naperture and divides the cell into daughter cells. Such simple cells of blue-green algae \\n(and bacteria) which lack a nuclear membrane, mitochondria, plastids and do not divide \\nby mitosis are called prokaryotic. The cells constituting the thalli of all other algae \\nexcepting the blue green are called eukaryotic. The eukaryotic cell has the same structure \\nas is typical of the higher plants. \\nALGAL FLAGELLA \\nThe motile cells of algae are provided with fine, protoplasmic, whiplike threads, \\nthe flagella. They are extremely fine and hyaline emergencies of the cytoplasm. In cells \\npossessing firm cell walls, the flagella are connected with the inner cytoplasm through \\nsmall pores in the cell wall. There is either a single anterior flagellum (rarely posterior) \\nor the flagella occur in pairs, rarely in great numbers on the cell. The . flagella on the cell \\nmay be equal (isokont) or unequal (heterokont) in length. When the flagella are inserted \\nlaterally one is directed forwards in motion and the other backwards. They function as \\nthe locomotory or propelling structures of the cell. Usually there is a single granule at \\nthe base of each flagellum. It is known as the blepharoplast. \\n(a) Structure of the Flagellum: Forming the Lore of the flagellum is an axial or central \\nfilament called the axoneme. The latter is surrounded by a cytoplasmic membrane or \\nsheath which terminates short of the apex. The naked, terminal portion of the axoneme \\nis called the end piece. The tip of the end piece may be blunt and rounded or pointed. \\nIn cross section the flagellum consists of two inner central simple fibrils forming an elastic \\naxial thread. It is surrounded by nine united, peripheral contractile, thicker protein double \\nfibrils. All are enclosed by sheath which is an extension of the plasma membrane. Each \\nperipheral fibril is composed of two thin fibrils. The two central fibrils are single. They \\nlie side by side and are sometimes enclosed by a sheath of their own. The fibrils are hollow \\nand extend along the entire length of the flagellum. The nine peripheral fibrils join the \\nbasal granule but the two central fibrils stop short of the granule. This \\'9 + 2\\' pattern \\nof component fibrils is the basic structures of the flagellum of all organisms except the \\nbacteria. \\n(b) Kinds of Flagella: They are of two main types, whiplash and tinsel. The whiplash \\nflagellum has a smooth surface. The tinsel flagellum bears longitudinal rows of fine, \\nminute flimmer hairs arranged along the axis almost to the tip of the flagellum. There \\nmay be a single row of hairs as in the Euglenophyta and Pyrrophyta or two as in \\nChrysophyceae and Phaeophyceae. The hairs arise from the margins of the peripheral \\nfibrils. The whiplash or smooth flagella are also known by other names such as acronematic \\nor peitchgeisel. The other names for the tinsel flagella are pantollematic flimmer or flimmergeisel.EUKARYOTA 347 \\nThe use of an electron microscope has revealed a third kind of flagellum it which the \\nsurface of the flagellum is covered by scales (Chara) and minute, short, stiff hairs. Manto \\nand Parke (1960) described this type of flagellum in Micromonas pusilla (Prasinophyceae). \\nThe hairs differ from those on the tinsel type. They can be easily detached. \\n~~II~~~~Eu.rStructural granule \\n~~~:ltKt-- Carboxysomes \\nMucilaginous sheath \\nIII1MfHl.m.;\\';\\'--Gas Vacuoles \\n~rl~::7~~~~::\\':- Nucleoid \\n(A) \\nEye spot --.~~D \\nDeveloping septum \\n\\\\\\\\\\'\\\\\\'r\\'tittt1.l:r Photosynthetic lamel iae \\nibosomes \\nMucilaginous sheath \\nCytoplasm \\n•. ~\\'Il<I\\\\,.-Cell wall \\nVolutin granules \\n\"IF-HII!I\\'fP\\'\\'\\' Thylakoids \\nChloroplast \\nmembrane \\nPyrenoid Starch plate \\n(8) \\nFig. 2 : Fine structure of Prokaryotic (A) and Eukaryotic (B) Cell of a unicellular algae348 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nREPRODUCfION \\nIn their methods of reproduction, the algae are as diverse as they are in the nature \\nof the thallus.

These star cells when detached from the parent \\nplant give rise to a new plant. \\nASEXUAL REPRODUCTION \\nProtoplast of the cell divides either in the vegetative cells or in special cells called \\nsporangia forming into several protoplasts (spores which may be motile or non motile) \\n(i) Zoospores: Motile and are formed under favourable condition of growth. Naked, \\nmotile and fertile cells.

They \\ncan be develop in chains. Each akinete forms a new plant. eg Anabaena, Cladophora, \\nVaucheria. \\n(vi) Hypnospores: Thick walled aplanospore which develop under favourable \\nconditions. When favourable condition appear they germinate to giverise a new plant. \\nUlothrix, Vaucheria. \\n(vii) Endospores: In Bacillariphyceae and Cyanophyceae, under favourable condition, \\nthese structures are produced. On the onset of favourable conditions they germinate to \\ngive rise to a new plant. eg- Dermocarpa \\n(viii) Exospore: Sometimes from the ruptured portion of the cell protoplast oozes \\nout and give rise to a non-mobile spore. eg- Clzaemosiphon \\n(ix) Palmella Stage: On the onset of dry conditions, daughter protoplasts of certain \\nalgae produced as a result of asexual reproduction do not escape from the cell but their \\nwall gelatinizes and their contents keep dividing thus forming a macroscopic colony. As \\nthis stage resembles an algae Palmella hence this stage is called as Paimella stage. On \\nthe availability of water the contents are released forming either zoospores or aplanospores \\nwhich germinatE: to give rise to a new thallus. \\n(x) Carpospore: Formed in carposporophyte, in members of Rhodophyceae. eg\\xad\\nPolysiphonia.350 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nSEXUAL REPRODUCTION \\nExcept cyanophyceae sexual reproduction occures in all algal members. [when \\ngametes fuse to form zygote] on the basis of organs and their complexity, the following \\nsix types of sexual reproduction are recognized in different groups of algae: \\nI. Autogamy: When two gametes of the same mOL\\'ler cell fuse to form a diploid \\nnucleus, it is called autogamy. In this process there is only fusion of two gametic nuclei \\n(Karyogamy). The autogamy lacks incorporation of external genes (do not show new \\ncharacters) eg - Diatoms \\nII. Hologamy: The vegetative cells of different strains (+) and (-) (female & male) \\nbehave as gametes and fuse to form zygote. More advance- it involves fusion of two cells \\nhaving different genetic constitution ego Unicellular forms (Chlamydomonas) \\nIII. Isogamy: The two gametes which fuse to form zygote, are morphologically and \\nphysiolOgically similar (isogametes). They are usually motile and flagellated. eg- Ulotlzrix, \\nChlamydomonas. \\nIV. Physiological anisogamy: Gametes are similar in morphological characters, they \\nshow physiological variation with (+) and (-) strains. eg - SpirogtJra, Zygnema, Ectocarpus. \\nV. Anisogamy: Gametes are morphologically and physiologically distinct. The male \\nor (microgametes) are smaller and more active, whereas female or macro gametes are larger. \\neg- Chlamydomonas. \\nVI. Oogamy: Advanced type of sexual reproduction. Large non motile egg or ovum \\nfuses with a small motile sperm or antherozoid (in Rhodophyceae, sperm are non motile). \\nEgg is formed with in the oogonium and sperms with in the antheridium. eg- Volvox, \\nOedogolliul1l, Chara, Vallcheria, Sargassllm, Polysiphollia. \\nTYPES OF LIFE CYCLE \\nThe sequence of orderly changes in growth and development of an algae is said \\nto be life cycle. During the process of sexual reproduction gametes fertilize resulting into \\na diploid zygote, this undergoes reduction division and forms haploid plants or it directly \\nforms a diploid plant. A generation is considered as a somatic phase. The alteration of \\ngeneration means a situation in which a plant depicts two somatic phases which regularly \\nalternate during the life cycle i.e. haploid (gametophytic) and diploid (sporophytic). \\n(I) Haplontic Type: Plant is haploid and bears haploid gametes in the gametangium. \\nThe gametic fusion results in the formation of a diploid zygote which is the only diploid \\nphase in the life cycle. The zygote nucleus divides meiotically to produce four meiospores, \\neach of these develops into a new individual. Thus, there is an alternation of a haploid \\nplant with a diploid zygote. eg- Chlamydomollas (unicellular), Ulothrix, Oedogonium, \\nSpirogyra, Zygllema and Chara. \\n(II) Diplontic Type: Diploid plant bears sex organ (gametangia) which are also \\ndiploid. The reduction division takes place at the time of the formation of gametes and \\nas such the gametes are haploid. After gametic fusion diploid stage is re-established in \\nthe form of zygote. The zygote does not undergo any reduction divisipn and it gives rise \\nto a diploid plant body. Thus, there is an alteration of a diploid plant with haploid \\ngametes.eg: Cladophora, SargasS1l11l and DiatomsEUKARYOTA \\n~!

He divided Algae into seven \\ndivisions, which were further sub divided into classes. The names of divisions and classes \\nare given below: \\nDivision 1: Chlorophyta includes about 5700 forms out of which 90% are fresh water \\nand the remaining 10% are marine. Dominant pigments are chlorophyll a and b, the reserve \\nfood starch. Divided into two classes: (1) Chlorophyceae (green algae) e.g., Volvox, Ulothrix; \\n(2) Charophyceae (stoneworts) e.g., Chara \\nDivision 2: Euglenophyta includes 450 fresh water or terrestrial forms. Dominant \\npigments are chlorophyll and ~ carotene and reserve foods are paramylum and fats. Has \\nbeen divided into a single class Euglenophyceae (the euglenoids) e.g., Euglena \\nDivision 3: Pyrrophyta include 1000 species mainly unicellular rarely colonial. \\nPigments are chlorophyll a & c, carotene and xanthophylls. Reserve foods is starch/ oil. \\nDivided into two classes: (1) Desmophyceae (dinophysids) e.g., Desmarestia; (2) Dinophyceae \\n(Dinoflagelloids) e.g., DillophysisEUKARYOTA 355 \\nDivision 4: Chrysophyta represented by 6000 species of which 75% are freshwater \\nand the remaining 25% marine. Dominant pigments are carotene and xanthophylls and \\nreserve food is leucosin and oil. Divided into three classes: (1) Chrysophyceae (golden \\nbrown algae) e.g, Chromulina; (2) Xanthophyceae (yellow green algae) e.g., Botnjdium; (3) \\nBacillariophyceae (diatoms) e.g., Pinnularia. \\nDivision 5: Phaeophyta (Brown algae) represented by 1000 mostly marine forms, \\ndominant pigments are phycophyein and fucoxanthin and reserve foods are laminarin \\nand mannitol. Divided into three classes: (1) Isogeneratae ego Ectocarpus (2) Hetergeneratae \\ne.g. Myrionema and (3) Cyclosporae e.g., Sargassllm. \\nDivision 6: Cyanophyta (Blue green algae). Represented by 1500 mostly fresh water \\nspecies pigments are chlorophyll a & b, C-phycocyanin and C-phycoerythrin and the. \\nreserve food is cyanophycean starch. Motile cells absent. Divided into a single class \\nMyxophyceae ego Nostoc, Anabaena. \\nDivision 7: Rhodophyta (Red Algae) includes 2500 species mostly marine. \\nPredominant pigments are r-phycoerythrin. Reserve food is floridean starch. Division \\ncontains only one class Rhodophyceae e.g., PolysipllOnia, Gracilaria, Batrac/1ospermum (fresh \\nwater). \\nChristensen (1964) proposed a new scheme of primary classification of algae into \\nProkaryota and Eukaryota on the basis of difference between the prokaryotic and \\neukaryotic cells. It is briefly given below: \\nAlgae \\nI \\nProkaryota comprising \\ndivision Cyanophyta \\nEukaryota including \\nall other divisions \\nexcept Cyanophyta \\nI \\nAconta (no flagellate \\nstages) comprising \\ndivision Rhodophyta \\nDivisions Chlorophyta \\nCharophyta and \\nEuglenophyta \\n(Chlorophylls \\npredominate, chlorophyll \\na and b) \\nI \\nContophora \\n(with flagellate \\nstages) \\nI \\nChromophyta (Carotenoids \\npredominate contain \\nchlorophyll a but not b) \\ncomprising divisions \\nXanthophyta, Chrysophyta \\nBacillariophyta, Pyrrophyta, \\nCryptophyta, Phaeophyta \\nG.W. Prescott (1969) emphasized the presence or absence of true nucleus in the algal \\ncells for their classification along with other characters viz. pigmentation, biochemical356 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nnature of cell wall and reserve food material and divided algae into nine phyla and \\nfourteen classes. The scheme proposed by him is as follows: \\nPhylum I Chlorophyta: Eukaryotic algae with chloroplasts surrounded by one \\nmembrane of chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum. \\nClasses (i) Chlorophyceae \\n(ii) Charophyceae \\nPhylum II Euglenophyta: Chlorophyll a and b, storage product paramylon. \\nPhylum III Chrysophyta-Chl. a and xanthophylls (golden brown algae) \\nClasses (i) Chrysophyceae \\n(ii) Bacillariophyceae \\n(iii) Heterokontae (xanthophyceae) \\nPhylum IV Pyrrophyta: mesokaryotic nucleus, chI a and c. \\nClasses (i) Desmokontae (Desmophyceae) \\n(ii) Dinokontae (Dinophyceae) \\nPhylum V Phaeophyta: ChI a and c, fucoxanthin, storage product chrysolaminarin \\noccurring in vesicles in cytoplasm. \\nClasses (i) Isogeneratae \\n(ii) Heterogeneratae \\n(iii) Cyclosporeae \\nPhylum VI Rhodophyta: ChI a and b, phycobiliproteins, storage product -floridian \\nstarch. \\nClasses (i) Bangioideae \\n(ii) Florideae \\nPhylum VII Cyanophyta - ChI a, phycobiliproteins \\nClasses (i) Coccogoneae \\n(ii) Hormogoneae \\nPhylum VIII Cryptophyta- ChI a and c, starch is reserve food. \\nPhylum IX Chloromonadophyta \\nTHE FUNGI \\nOnce, fungi and bacteria were considered parts of the plant kingdom, primarily \\nbecause they produce spores, have cells walls and obviously are not animals. Now it has \\nbecome clear that the organisms grouped together as fungi are definitely not plants. \\nThe name of the fungi is derived from their most obvious representatives, the \\nmushrooms (Greek, mykes, latin, fungus). They are eukaryotes and share with plants the \\npossession of a cell wall, liquid-filled intracellular vacuoles, microscopically visible \\nstreaming of the cytoplasm and (almost universal) lack of motility. However, they do notEUKARYOTA 357 \\ncontain photosynthetic pigments and are chemo-organoheterotrophs. Most grow aerobically \\nand obtain their energy by oxidation of organic substances. Compared to the plants, which \\nare organized into stems, roots and leaves, fungi show only very limited morphological \\ndifferentiation and practically no functional differentiation. \\nClassification of Fungi and Related Organisms \\nKingdom - Myceteae \\nDivision - Myxomycota - Slime molds \\nDivision Eumycota - True fungi \\nSub division Mastigomycotina - Fungi with motile cells \\nClass - Chytridiomycetes \\nClass - Hyphochytridiomycetes \\nClass - Oomycetes \\nSub division Zygomycotina - Fungi with zygospores \\nSub diviSion Ascomycotina - Fungi with asci \\nSub division Basidiomycotina - Fungi with basidia \\nSub division Deuteromycotina - Fungi without known sexual stages \\nGeneral Characteristics of Fungi \\nFungi constitute a large group of organisms, although about 100,000 species have \\nbeen named, 200,000 more species are estimated to remain undiscovered. Like insects and \\norchids, fungi are quite possibly speciating rapidly than they are being discovered. \\nThe Vegetative body: The vegetative body is a thallus. It consists of filaments about \\n5 ~m in diameter which are multiply branched and spread over or into the nutrient \\nmedium. The filaments or hyphae consist of a cell wall and cytoplasm with its inclusions. \\nThe hyphae may be without cross walls (in the lower fungi) or divided into cells by septa \\nin the higher fungi. However, even in the septate hyphae, the cytoplasm of the cells is \\ncontinuous via a central pore in the septum. The total of the hyphal mass of a fungal \\nthallus is called the mycelium. In certain stages, often during transition to the sexual or \\nasexual reproduction phase, the mycelium forms tissue like aggreagates, the so-called \\nplectenchyma. A typical plectenchyma is the \\'flesh\\' of the mushroom. In the higher fungi, \\nthe mycelium may also form thick strands, rhizomorphs, which function to transport \\nnutrients. \\nNutrition \\nA universal characteristic of fungi is that they are completely heterotrophic; no trace \\nof photosynthesis is found in any stage of any group. However, because they have walls, \\nfungi cannot engulf food as animals do; instead, fungi must obtain nutrients from the \\nenvironment from living, dying or dead organisms. On this basis, fungi are subdivided \\ninto three types: (1) biotrophs (parasites), which draw nutrients slowly from living hosts,358 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\noften without killing them; (2) necrotrophs, which attack living hosts so virulently that \\nthey kill the hosts and then absorb released nutrients. (3) saprotrophs, fungi that attack \\norganisms after they have died from other causes. \\nMany biotrophs secrete chemicals that cause the host cell membrane to become \\nunusually permeable to sugars or amino acids, as they leak from the host cell, the fungus \\nabsorbs them. In sophisticated parasites, damage to the host cell is so slight that the plant \\nresponds as though the fungus were a normal sink for metabolities, and extra sugars and \\namino acids are actually trai1sported by the plant from other leaves to the site of infection, \\njust as though the fungus were a developing fruit or other plant part. In biotrophic attacks, \\nfungal cells may remain confined solely to intercellular spaces; in other species; the fungus \\ncreates a small hole in the plant cell wall, then inserts a small portion, the haustorium, \\nof its filamentous cell through the hole. The haustorium is in close contact with the plant \\ncell plasma membrane, which probably makes it easier to absorb nutrients. \\nExtracellular Digestion: Natural release of sugars may be sufficient for the fungi, \\nbut typically they secrete digestive enzymes that attack host polymers, converting them \\nto sugars, amino acids, and lipids tllat can be absorbed. Saprotrophs depend predominantly \\non this form of extracellular digestion, and many depolymerize and consume cellulose \\n(brown rot fungi), hemicelluloses, and even lignin (white rot fungi). The ability either to \\nabsorb host-produced monomers or to secrete extracellular digestive enzymes is often both \\nspecies specific and tissue specific. Many biotrophic and saprotrophic fungi can attack \\nsuccessfully only a few or just one host species, or even just a single variety of one plant \\nspecies. Many fungi are even tissue specific: Wilt-inducing fusariums must invade xylem \\nand attack xylary middle lamellas; they cannot survive in cortex, pith, or phloem even \\nthough those cells are rich in free monomers. Fungi transmitted by aphids and other \\nphloem-sucking insects usually are able to attack only phloem: their toxins and extracellular \\nenzymes are not effective against other tissues. \\nGrowth and reproduction: Fungal hyphae elongate at their apices (apical growth). \\nIn most fungi every part of the mycelium has the potential for growth (elongation); a small \\npiece of mycelium is sufficient for inoculation to produce a new thallus. However, the \\nforms and mechanisms involved in the reproduction of fungi are extremely diverse and \\nare used as the basis for classification. Two kinds of reproduction are distinguished, \\nnamely sexual and asexual. Most fungi can reproduce in both ways. A universal character \\nof fungi is their formation of spores, resistant resting stages that are the primarily means \\nof reproduction, dispersal and survival, spores are produced either asexually or sexually. \\nAsexual reproduction of fungi is mostly by budding, fragmentation, or formation \\nof spores. Spore formation is the most widely distributed and most highly differentiated \\nmethod. Conidiospores are budded off at hyphal apices (in Penicillillm, Aspergilllls). When \\nthese arise inside sporangia (i.e. receptacles), the fungi are grouped as sporangiospores \\n(Mucor, Rhizopus). In the lower fungi, sporangia are often motile by means of flagella and \\nare called zoospores. The flagella conform to the typical eukaryotic model: they originate \\nfrom a blepharoplast in the cytoplasm and consist of eleven parallel fibrils of which nine \\nperipheral fibrils are arranged concentrically around two central ones (9 +2). \\nThe asexual reproduction characteristic of yeasts (budding fungi) is budding; theEUKARYOTA 359 \\nmother cell forms an out growth which receives a daughter nucleus, where upon the \\nnucleated out growth is pinched off as a \\'bud\\'. Asexual reproduction can also occur by \\nfragmentation of the hyphae into single cells, the oidia or arthrospores (e.g. in the milk \\nmould Endomyces Iactis). In some fungi these cells are surrounded by a thick wall and \\nare referred to as chlamydospores. Finally, there are some yeasts (Sclzizosaccharomyces) \\nwhich reproduce by binary fission in a manner similar to bacteria. \\nA \\n~Rhizoidal \\n,y f,/ yHyphae \\no \\nIter \\ncellular \\nhypha \\n~ \\nHaustorium \\nEctophytic hypha Ectophytic hypha \\nHaustorium \\nlGia ~ p~~ E ~nlF \\nHaustorium \\nFig. 3 : Modes of Nutrition \\nSclerotia (Sing: sclerotium) are more elaborate and even more resistant; they develop \\nas a section of mycelium branches profusely and the hyphae attract each other, forming \\na compact aggregate. The outermost hyphae are swollen and globose and have thick \\nmelanized walls. The inner mass consists of large hyphae (filled with nutrients such as \\noil, glycogen, mannitol, and trehalose) and small, thin-walled hyphae (rich in cytoplasm \\nand organelles). Rather than remaining distinct, the hyphae undergo numerous fusions \\nwith each other, forming a highly interconnected mass. Large amounts of mucilage are \\nsecreted around the hyphae, which seems to act as a water-holding substance. Sclerotia \\nare often formed by biotrophic fungi, and their germination frequently depends not merely \\non good conditions but on conditions favorable for the host as well. The sclerotia of360 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nSclerotium cepivorum germinate only when a host root happens to grow next to it, and \\nthose of Claviceps germinate in the spring, just when the host grasses are starting to \\nproduce flowers. \\nSexual reproduction: This, as in all other eukaryotes, comprises the union or \\nconjugation of two nuclei. In different fungi, the nuclear fusion may occur at different \\nintervals after the first parental contact. Sexual reproduction can usually be divided into \\nthree phases. \\nPlasmogamy, the fusion of two protoplasts. The resulting cell has two nuclei. This \\nnuclear pair or dikaryon does not need to fuse immediately, but it can persist in the \\ndikaryotic state during the rest of the cell division, the two nuclei dividing simultaneously \\n(conjugative division). The fusion of the two haploid nuclei (karyogamy) may occur later, \\noften only after formation of a fruiting body, to give the diploid nucleus of the zygote. \\nFollowing karyogamy, meiosis, the reduction division of the chromosomes to the haploid \\nnumber, takes place. These three processes or stages, plasmogamy, karyogamy, and \\nmeiosis, may occur in immediate sequence in some fungi, but in others they can occur \\nduring quite different stages of development. \\nIn the lower fungi the phase of sexual reproduction is initiated by the formation \\nof gametes, i.e. sexual cells. When the gametes formed by the male and female parental \\ncells are ipdistinguishable morphologically they are called isogametes. The gametes are \\noften formed inside morphologically differentiated cells, which are called gametangia, and \\nwhen these are morphologically distinct, the male gametangia are called antheridia and \\nthe female ones are called oogonia. \\nThe ways in which the gametes are transferred and plasmogamy achieved can again \\nbe sub divided into various kinds. In lower fungi, especially in aquatic ones, both gametes \\nare usually motile (planogametes) and fuse outside the gametangia (i.e. after liberation \\nfrom the gametangia). In the oomycetes only the male gamete is motile; it penetrates the \\noogonium and fertilizes the ovum. Zygomycetes are characterized by gametangiogamy, \\nthe fusion of whole, multinucleate gametangia into a coenozygote. \\nWhen the male and female gametangia originate from the same vegetative body \\n(produced from a single spore), the organism is referred to as a homothallic or hermaphrodite \\nfungus (monozoic). In heterothallic, or dizoic, fungi the thalli are either male or female, \\nthat is, they bear only male or female sex organs. Homothallic fungi can be self-fertilising \\n(autogamous). However, in some homothallic fungi no self-fertilisation occurs due to some \\nphysiological inhibitory mechanism, which is referred to as incompatibility. This is the \\ncase in Neurospora, for example, which, though homothallic, needs conjugation between \\nmembers of different types (+ and - ) to establish fertilization, individuals belonging to \\nthe same type are incompatible. \\nClassification \\nThe classification of fungi, like that of bacteria, is designed mainly for practical \\napplication but it also bears some relation to phylogenetic considerations. The nomenclature \\nis binomial, with a generic and a specific name (eg: Aspergillus lliger). Species are collected \\nin genera, genera in families (suffix -aceae), families in orders (suffix-ales), and ordersEUKARYOTA 361 \\nin classes (suffix-mycetes). The division of mycota, or fungi and moulds, includes the true \\nslime moulds (Myxomycetes), the lower fungi (Phycomycetes), and the higher fungi \\n(Eumycetes). \\nAlexopolous and Mims proposed fungal classification in 1979. They place the fungi \\nincluding the slime molds in the kingdom mycetae of the super kingdom Eukaryota which, \\nin addition, includes four other kingdoms. They divide the kingdom mycetae into three \\ndivisions namely: 1. Gymnomycota 2. Mastigomycota and 3. Amastigomycota. The division \\nis sub divided into subdivision, classes, sub-classes and orders. \\nDivision I Gymnomycota \\nIt includes phagotrophic organism devoid of cell walls.

They \\nare heterotrophic and form spores, but they lack walls and have a unique body \\norganization. In true slime molds, the body is a large mass of protoplasm (slime) with \\na volume of several cubic centimeters containing thousands or millions of nuclei, all in \\nthe same cytoplasm and covered only by a plasma membrane. This mass of protoplasm, \\ncalled a plasmodium (pI: plasmodia), is capable of migrating over a substrate, much like \\nan amoeba, but is so large that it is easily visible to the naked eye. The plasmodium digests \\nmaterial from the substrate as it moves along; bacteria; yeasts, and decayed plant material364 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nare the most common nutrients and are engulfed just as bacteria are engulfed by an \\namoeba. Such consumption of particulate matter is not possible in true fungi because of \\ntheir rigid cell walls. \\nThe slime molds are of two types, acellular and cellular. The somatic phase in the \\nformer is called the plasmodium. It is a free living, multinucleate, apparently naked \\nprotoplasmic mass. It is holocarpic. The somatic phase in the cellular slime molds is termed \\nthe pseudoplasmodium. \\nIn response to environmental cues, a plasmodium aggregates its protoplasm, forming \\none or several mounds; it then extends upward, producing sporangia on stalks. Spores \\nwith true walls are formed and released; the spores are extremely resistant, surviving for \\nmany years even under adverse conditions. Meiosis occurs after the spores form; then \\nthree nuclei degenerate. Upon germination, the spores may release either an amoeboid \\nor a flagellated cell, and the two forms are interconvertible. The cell grows and may \\nundergo both nuclear and cellular division proliferating into a population of haploid cells. \\nEach cell contains mating type factors, and when two compatible cells meet, they fuse \\ninto one mass, mixing the two types of nuclei. Fusion is not limited to two cells; many \\ncells may fuse, resulting in a multi-nucleate plasmodium. Karyogamy occurs shortly \\nthereafter, and nuclei are then diploid. The plasmodium continues to migrate and feed \\nuntil induced to undergo another round of spore formation. \\nThe phylogenetic-evolutionary - relationships of slime molds to other organisms \\nare not known. They may represent a surviving line of evolution which originated not \\nlong after eukaryotes arose and which has changed little since. It is also possible that \\nsome are extremely reduced forms that evolved from more advanced organisms. Uncertainly \\nabout their evolutionary position is compounded because other groups-cellular slime \\nmolds, protostelids and net slime molds have other combinations of fungal and non fungal \\ncharacters. \\nThe characteristic features of Myxomycetes: \\n1. The somatic phase is represented by a multinucleate apparently naked acellular \\nslimy protoplasmic mass called plasmodium. \\n2. The plasmodium is the product of syngamy (Diploid). \\n3. The diploid plasmodium is holocarpic, free living and active. It contain and \\nsecretes slime. \\n4. Normally at the fruiting time, the entire plasmodium is organized into one or \\nmore plant like reproductive structures, the sporangia (sporophores) or under \\nconditions of stress and strains it becomes converted into\\' an irregular hard \\nstructure, the sclerotium. \\n5. The sporangium generally develops a tough non-cellular layer or wall called \\nthe peridium which is often studded with tiny crystals of calcium salts. \\n6. Within the peridium is usually an intricate network of fine tube-like structures \\nconstituting the capillitium.EUKARYOTA 365 \\nGermination Myxamoebae \\nspore-------II \\n/ \\n\" Swarm ~ cells ~ 2> .....

The numerous spores are differentiated from the diploid protoplast of the \\nsporangium by meiosis. \\n8. The encapsulated haploid spores or meiospores are close packed between the \\nfine tubes of the capitllitium but are free from them when mature. \\n9. The spore wall is differentiated into two layers, the outer of which is sculptured \\nor spiny. \\n10. On germination, the haploid spores or meiospore give rise either to myxamoebae \\nor bifagellate swarm cells which function as gametes. \\n11. The swarm cells or myxamoebae do not produce slime. \\n12. The sporangium in Physarum thus functions as an organ of sexual reproduction. \\n13. Sexual reproduction is of isogamous type. \\n14. The diploid zygote, by repeated mitoses but no cytokinesis, directly gives rise \\nto multinucleate plasmodium. \\nThe term Plasmodium is used for a molded object which is multinucleate surrounded \\nby plasma membrane and a gelatinuous slime sheath with fibrils in it.366 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nSomatic Phase: The creeping multinucleate apparently naked plasmodium which \\nrepresents the somatic or assimilative phase in the life cycle of myxomycetes, varies in \\nstructure in the different species. Alexopoulos (1960) by described three types namely \\nprotoplasmodium, aphanoplamodium and phaneroplasmodium. \\n1. Protoplasmodium: The plasmodium in some myxomycetes (order Echinosteliales) \\nis simple and of a primitive type. It is a uninucleate tiny mass of nearly homogenous \\nslimy protoplasm which form pseudopode but shows no distinction into veins. It is the \\nsmallest among the myxomycetes and remains microscopic as long as it exists. The \\ncytoplasmic stream is indistinct, slow and irregular. At the fruiting time it gets converted \\ninto a single sporangium. \\n2. Aphanoplasmodium: This type of plasmodium is characteristic of the order \\nstemonitomycetales. Early in its development the aphanoplasmodium looks very much \\nlike a protoplasmodium. During further growth it elongates and branches, finally resulting \\nin a network of delicate strands. The aphanoplasmodium lacks the slimy sheath. The \\nplasmodial protoplasm is less granular and tl1US transparent and not easily visible. The \\ndistinction into ectoplasm and endoplasm in not conspicuous. The cytoplasmic streaming \\nis, however, rapid and confined by a fine membrane. \\n3. Phaneroplasmodium: It is the most common type and characteristic of the order \\nphysarales. The mature phaneroplasmodium is a massive structure. In its initial stages \\nof development it is very much like the proloplasmodium. The multinucleate slimy \\nprotoplasm of the phaneroplasmodium is highly granular. It is differentiated into \\nectoplasm and endoplasm. At maturity it is divisible into an anterior fan-shaped perforated \\nsheet of protoplasm and posterior zone consisting of a reticulate network of tubular veins \\nor strands in which flows the rapid endoplasmic stream. \\nSclerotium formation: Under conditions of stress and strain, the phaneroplasmodium \\nbecomes converted into an irregular hardened mass of thick-walled cellular units. It is \\ntermed the sclerotium. \\nThe polynucleate thick-walled units constituting the sclerotium are termed spherules. \\nThe sclerotia and spherules remain dormant under conditions unfavourable for vegetative \\ngrowth. With the return of conditions suitable for growth, the sclerodium germinates to \\ngive rise to a new plasmodium. \\nReproductive phase: Normally on reaching a certain stage of maturity, the \\nMyxomycete plasmodium passes into the reproductive stage. During this stage the entire \\nplasmodium becomes converted into one or more fruit-like bodies, the sporophores or \\nsphororigia which bear the spores. This process is termed sporulation. The latter bear \\nspores within sporophores. The sporophores in the endosporus Myxomycetes chiefly are \\nof three types namely sporangia, aethalia and plasmodiocarps. \\nSporangia: Most of the endosporous Myxomycetes (order physarales) produce fruit \\nbodies of this type. At the fruiting time the planeroplasmodium becomes converted into \\na group of several stalked, sometimes sessile sac-like structures, the sporangia. The \\nsporangia in the group remain separate from one another. However, they arise in close \\nproximity from a common thin transparent cellophane like base called the hypothallus.EUKARYOTA 367 \\nThe latter is secreted and deposited during conversion of the plasmodium on the portion \\nof the substratum formerly occupied by it. In some cases the hypothallus is absent. \\nExamples are Aretjria, Physarum, Trichia, Didymium and others. \\nD \\nFig. 5 : Different types of sporangia in slime molds: A. Arcyria, B. Steomonitis; C. \\nComatricha; D. Didymium; E. Physanmr \\nAethalia: Aethalium type of fruit body is characteristic of Lycogala and Fuligo. The \\nplasmodium, at the fruiting time is fairly large structure. It becomes converted into a group \\nof saclike sporangia that do not separate from one another. The entire fructification which \\nis termed aethalium, is enclosed in a common peridium and share a common hypothallus. \\nThe sporangia! walls in the aggregation may be distinct, hardly visible or not present \\nat all. \\nPlasmodiocarp: In forms like Hemitrichia the fruit body is very much like a sessile \\nsporangium that retains the shape of the plasmodial venation. This type of sporophore \\nis called a plasmodiocarp. It is formed by the concentration of the plasmodial protoplasm \\naround some of the main veins followed by the development of peridium around cell. \\nA typical sporophore or sporangium consists of six parts namely hypothallus, stalk; \\nperidium, columella, capillitium and spores. All the sporophores produce spores but may \\nor may not have all the other five parts. Generally the spores are globose in form and \\nhave a thick cell wall which is usually sculptured and rarely smooth. The mature spores \\nare uninucleate and haploid. Meiosis occurs in the spores when young. \\nClassification: Macbridge (1899) was the first to use the term myxomycetes. It is \\ngroup of organism having delicate structure and brilliant colours. They exist in non-green \\nslimy masses of protoplasm sending out pseudopodia. They are found in cold, moist shady \\nplaces in dead organic matter such as decaying logs and fallen dead leaves in the woods. \\nThe class include the true plasmodial acellular slime molds most of which produce \\npigmented spores in small, delicate sporangia. The class myxomycetes is often divided \\ninto the following three sub classes:368 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(i) Ceratiomyxomycetidae: It contains a single order ceratiomyxales represented by \\na single family ceratiomyxaceae. Ceratiomyxa with three exosporus species is the only \\ngenus included in this family. \\n(ii) Stemonitomycetidae: It includes a single order stemonitales which comprises \\nonly one family stemonitaceae. It is endosporous. The somatic phase is of \\naphanoplasmodium type. \\n(iii) Myxogastromycetidae: It comprises four orders namely Physarales, Siceales, \\nEchinosteliales and Trichiales. All are endosporous. The somatic phase is usually of \\nprotoplasmodial or phaneroplasmodial type. The class myxomycetes thus contains six \\norders. Of these Physarales belonging to the sub class myxogastromycetidae is the most \\nimportant. \\nSystematic Position of Slime Molds \\n• Members are regarded by many mycologist as parasitic II slime molds\". However \\nGauman (1926), Bessey (1962), Alexopoulus (1962) included these among the \\ntrue fungi. \\n• In recent years the controversy has been revitalized by inclusion of \\nplasmodiophoromycetes as a class of myxomycotina (Ainsworth 1966, 1973). \\n• Klein and Cronquist (1967) suggest that Woronina and Polymyxa should be \\nseparated from plasmodiophorales because of their cellulosic cell wall and \\nzoospore structures. \\n• Though this group has been included under mastigomycotina we do it with \\nfull realization that these organism have no clear cut affinities with any group. \\nThey are neither true slime molds nor true fungi. The Plasmodium and heterokant \\nzoospores are characters that relate these organism to slime molds but the \\ndifferences are many: \\n(a) Plasmodium in slime molds is free living while obligately parasite in these \\norganism. \\n(b) Presence of zoosporangia and resting spores which are not formed by myxomycetes. \\n(c) Presence of golgi bodies in the Plasmodium and in the zoospore relates to \\nPlasmodiophorales with Mastigomycotina. Myxomycetes lack golgi bodies. \\n(d) Wall is made up of chitin and not cellulose. In myxomycetes the wall of the \\nspores are made up of cellulose. \\nUntil more is known about the site of karyogamy, meiosis and life cycle of these \\norganisms any judgment on their relationship will be only half baked and unprofitable. \\nTHE PROTOZOA \\nThe sub kingdom Protozoa which was originally included in the kingdom protista \\nincludes unicellular, non photosynthetic, eukaryotic microorganism that are considered \\nsingle celled, The Protozoan Animals. \\nThe Protozoa may be defined as \\'microscopic, acellular animalcules existing singlyEUKARYOTA 369 \\nor in colonies without tissues and organs, having one or more nuclei. When in colonies, \\nthey differ form metazoa in having all the individuals alike except those engaged in \\nreproductive activities\\'. \\nGeneral Characters \\nSize \\n1. The protozoans are small, generally microscopic animalcules. \\n2. Simplest & primitive of all animals with very simple body organisation, i.e. \\nprotoplasmic grade of organisation. \\n3. Acellular, animals, without tissues & organs. \\n4. Body naked or covered by pellicle but in some forms body is covered with shells \\nand often provided with internal skeleton. \\n5. Protozoans are solitary or colonial; in colonial forms the individuals are alike \\nand independent. \\n6. Body shape variable; it may be spherical; oval, elongated or flattened. \\n7. Body protoplasm is differentiated into an outer ectoplasm and inner endoplasm. \\n8. Protozoans may have one or more nuclei; nuclei may be monomorphic or \\ndimorphic, vesicular or massive. Vesicular nuclei are commonly spherical, oval \\nor biconvex, consist of a central body, the endosome (nucleolus) encircled by \\na zone of nuclear sap. \\n9. Locomotory organelles are pseudopodia, flagella, cilia or none. \\n10. Nutrition may be holozoic (animal-like), holophytic (plant-like), saprozoic or \\nparasitic. Digestion intracellular, takes place inside the food vacuoles. \\n11. Respiration occurs by diffusion through general body surface. \\n12. Excretion occurs through general body surface but in some forms through a \\ntemporary opening in the ectoplasm or through a permanent pore, the cytopyge. \\n13. Contractile vacuoles perform osmoregulation in fresh water forms & also help \\nin removing excretory products. \\n14. Reproduction asexual or sexual; asexual reproduction occurs by binary fission, \\nmultiple fission, budding or sporulation and sexual reproduction is performed \\nby gamete formation or conjugation. \\n15. Life cycle often exhibits alternation of generation, i.e. it includes asexual and \\nsexual phases. \\n16. Encystment usually occurs to tide over the unfavourable conditions and it also \\nhelps in dispersal. \\n17. The protozoans exhibit mainly two modes of life, free-living inhabiting fresh \\nwater, salt-water and damp places, and parasitic living as ectb & endoparasities. \\nThey are also commercial in habit. \\nThe Protozoa are usually microscopic and not visible to the naked eyes. Their size370 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nvaries from 2 microns to 250 microns (one micron (11) is equal to 1/1000 mm or 0.001 \\nmm). Babesia, Leishmania and Plasmodium are the smallest protozoans known so far. Some \\nof the larger protozoa, like Amoeba and Paramedum, can be seen with naked eyes, \\n. Spirostomum, a ciliate, grows to 3 mm long. Pelomyxa, a giant amoeba, attains a diameter \\nof about 1 to 5 mm. Porospora gigantea, a sporozoa, grows to about 16 mm long. Cycloclypeus, \\na foraminifera, exceeds a diameter of about 50 mm and some shelled marine protozoans \\nhave diameters of about 63 mm. \\nShape \\nProtozoa, the most primitive of all organisms, exhibit nearly all types of body shape. \\nThe body shape of a protozoa is definite but it may usually vary within narrow limits. \\nThe body shape is usually determined by the consistency of cytoplasm, limiting membranes \\nof the body, shells & skeleton. Amoeba has an irregular, asymmetrical body shape because \\nof the absence of rigid body envelope. However, the floating forms usually possess \\nspherical body shape like Noctiluca; the body shape is usually elongated in active \\nswimmers like Euglena and Paramedum, the body shape may be flattened in creeping forms \\nlike OXljtricha. Shells and tests like those of Difflugia and Arcella determine the shape of \\nthese species. It may be funnel-shaped like stentor, bell-shaped like Vorticella and so on. \\nSome of the protozoans like Radiolarians exhibit spherical symmetry and attached species \\nlike Vorticella exhibit more or less radial symmetry. \\nBody Envelope & Skeleton \\nThese protect them from external environmental hazards. The body envelope, being \\nselective in nature, allows exchange of substances across it and helps in perceiving various \\ntypes of stimuli. However, the body envelope, in protozoans, may be either plasmalemma \\nor pellicle. In some species like Amoeba proteus, the body envelope is a thin plasma \\nmembrane or plasmalemma which is mucopolysaccharide in nature. It helps in adhesion \\nto the substratum and in the exchange of various materials. The pellicle is comparatively \\nthicker, tough, elastic and porteinous in nature, it helps in maintaining the general shape \\nof the protozoans and performs the usual functions. \\nThe skeletal layers are secreted in still other protozoans in which their protoplasmic \\nbody remains protected. These include (a) cyst, (b) theca, (c) lorica and (d) test or shell. \\nIt is primarily secreted during unfavourable conditions. The encysted individuals \\ncomfortably tide over the environmental hazards. The theca is another skeletal layer found \\nin many dinoflagellates like Ceratium & Glenodinium. It is a coat of closely-fitted armour \\nof cellulose, comparable to the thick cell walls of higher plants. The lorica, in majority \\nof dinoflagellates, in differentiated into a number of plates arranged into a definite pattern; \\nbut in some forms, it may be formed of two valves. The lorica is still another skeletal \\nlayer found in certain protozoans like Salpingoeca, Monosiga, Dinobnjon, Synura splendida \\nand Poteriodendron, etc. It is a coat of less-closely fitted armour of protozoans than the \\ntheca. The lorica is usually vase-shaped or tubular having an opening for the emergence \\nof the anterior part of the animal or its appendages. The base of the lorica is either attached \\ndirectly to the substratum (in sessile individuals .like Salipingoeca) or it may terminate inEUKARYOTA 371 \\na stalk like Monosiga. In colonial loricated protozoans, one lorica may be attached to \\nanother lorica directly as in Dinobryon or one lorica may attached to another lorica by \\na stalk as in Poteriodendron. The shells or tests are still other skeletal layer of protozoans; \\nthese are of common occurrence. There are loose armour with one or more openings over \\nthe body of protozoans like Arcella, Difflugia, etc. In Arcella the shell is thin and composed \\nof pseduochitin (proteins plus carbohydrates) and ventrally it has an aperture from which \\n3 or 4 pseudopodia project out. In Diffugia the shell is made of sand and other foreign \\nsubstances like fragments of foraminiferan\\'s shell and sponge spicules. These foreign \\nsubstances get embedded in a secreted matrix by the animal, working like cement, to form \\nthe shell. \\nTheradiolarian\\'s shells are internal skeletal layer lying between ectoplasm and \\nendoplasm. It forms a central capsule, which is composed of pseudochitin or silica or \\nstrontium sulphate and secreted by the cytoplasm. The central capsule is perforated by one \\nto many pores through which the extra-capsular cytoplasm extends out as fine pseudopodia. \\nPellicle \\nA \\nB \\nE shell of \\npseudochitin \\nJ K \\nSiliceous \\nshell \\no \\nFig. 6 : Various types of skeletons in protozoa.

Helmet-shaped radiolarian skeleton372 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nCytoplasm \\nThe cytoplasm of protozoa is generally colorless but certain coloured species are \\nalso found; Blepharisma lateritia is rose-red and Stentor coeruleus is blue. The cytoplasm \\nis commonly divided into peripheral clear ectoplasm and inner granular endoplasm. These \\ntwo may change from one to the other as is reported in Amoeba proteus. The cytoplasm \\ncontains various organelles like mitochondria, golgi bodies, endoplasmic reticulum, \\nribosomes, lysosomes, centrioles, microtubules, plastids, etc. \\nNucleus \\nThe nuclei of Protozoa exhibit a greater variety of size, shape and structure than \\nthe nuclei of Metazoa. The nucleus of Protozoa has a nuclear membrane, nUcleoplasm, \\noxychromatin, basichromatin, and there may be a nucleolus. The nuclear membrane \\nremains intact even in cell division. There are various kinds of nuclei in protozoa 1. \\nVesicular nucleus has a large amount of nuceloplasm, the chromatin is small in quantity \\nand it forms small granules, the achromatin (oxychromatin) is more fluid and its network, \\nif present, is coarse, there is a round endosome of basichromatin or oxychromatin, or of \\nboth e.g, Euglena, Arcella, Entamoeba 2. Massive or computer nucleus has a small amount \\nof nucleoplasm, there is a large amount of chromatin forming evenly scattered small \\ngranules, the achromatin is viscid forming a fine network, eg., Amoeba. In the majority \\nof protozoa the nuclei show a structure intermediate between the vesicular and massive \\nnuclei. 3 polyenergid nucleus has several sets of chromosomes, instead of one set inside \\nthe nuclear membrane, this is due to mitosis occurring repeatedly \\'inside the nuclear \\nmembrane. But the sets of chromosomes are finally liberated and each forms a new nucleus. \\nThe polyenergid condition is a provision for spore formation, eg., Radiolaria. \\nLocomotion \\nThe Protozoa perform locomotion or movement by various organelles; pseudopodia \\ncharacteristic of Sarcodina, flagella characteristic of flagellate (Mastigophora), cilia \\ncharacteristics of Ciliata and other contractile structures of pellicle, myonemes, characteristic \\nof Sporozoa and few others. The seat of locomotion lies in the ectoplasm, since locomotor \\norganelles either arise from it or are present in it. \\n(A) Pseudopodia: Pseudopodia are generally temporary out growths of protoplasm \\nfrom any part of the body, they are found in those protozoa which are \\'naked\\' or have \\na very thin pellicle. Pseudopodia may be of ectoplasm or they may also have a core of \\nendoplasm. Following kinds of pseudopodia are found. \\n(i) Lobopodia are blunt, short or finger-like, they are made of ectoplasm with a core \\nof fluid endoplasm, e.g. Arcella & Amoeba. \\n(ii) Filopodia are fine, long threads, often with rounded ends, at times they may \\nbranch, they are made of only hyaline ectoplasm, ego A radiosa-Radiolaria. \\n(iii) Rhizopodia or reticulopodia are thin, long and branching, the branches of \\nadjacent pseudopodia may anastomose to form a network which also serves as a trap \\nfor capturing food, ego Elphidium.EUKARYOTA 373 \\n(iv) Axopodia are long, stiff threads made of ectoplasm, with a hard central axial \\nfilament of endoplasm, unlike others they are semi-permanent, ego ActinophnJs, Axopodia \\nare not organelles of locomotion but are only for capturing food. \\nFig. 7 : Types of pseudopodia. L. Lobopodia of Amoeba; B. Filopodia of Euglypha; C. \\nReticulopodia of Globigeri1la D. Axopodia of Acti1lopltnjs \\n(B) Flagella: Flagella are extremely fine fibres having a central axoneme made of \\ntwo longitudinal fibrils, and an enveloping protoplasmic sheath having nine double \\nlongitudinal fibrils forming a ring. All 20 fibrils lie in a matrix of dense cytoplasm and \\nthey fuse at the base to join a basal granule or kinetosome. The kinetosome may be joined \\nto the nucleus by a rhizoplast. The basal granule is often synonymous with a centriole \\nbecause it initiates nuclear divisions, if it does not act as a centriole then it is connected \\nby a rhizoplast to a centriole or to the nucleus. At the tip of the main flagellum may be \\na very fine and piece or mastigoneme, or the main axis of the flagellum may bear fine, \\nflexible lateral processes or mastigonemes on one side or on both sides. Mastigonemes \\nconstitute the so-called flimmer or ciliary flagellum. Flagella are recognized to be of the \\nfollowing types depending upon the arrangement of mastigonemes in them: \\n(i) Stichonematic: When the mastigonemes are present on one side of the flagellum; \\nit is called stichonematic flagellum. Eg., Flagellum of Eugle1la. \\n(ii) Pantonematic: When the mastigonemes are present in two or more rows arranged \\non both the sides of the flagellum, it is called pantonematic, eg., Flagellum of Paranema. \\n(iii) Acronematic: When the mastigonemes are absent and the distal end of the \\nflagellum ends in a terminal filament. Eg., flagellum of Chlamydomonas.374 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(iv) Pentachronematic: When the mastigonemes are present in two rows on the \\nlateral sides of the flagellum but the flagellum ends in terminal filament, eg., Flagellum \\nof Urcoelus. \\n(v) In some cases, the flagellum is simple without mastigonemes and/ or terminal \\nfilament, Chilomonas, CnJPtomonas. \\n(C) Cilia: Cilia are exactly like flagella in structure and there is no real distinction \\nbetween them, except in the method of working. In primitive forms cilia cover the entire \\nbody, but in more specialized forms cilia are restricted to certain regions only. Cilia arise \\nfrom kinetosomes, from each kinetosome arises a rhizoplast which does not join the \\nnucleus, nor do cilia bear any mastigonemes. Running slightly to the right of a longitudinal \\nrow of kinetosomes is a delicate thread called kinetodesma. A row of kinetosomes with \\nits kinetodesmata forms a longitudinal unit called kinety, all kinetia of an animal constitue \\nits infraciliary system. Infraciliary system is characteristic of all ciliates, even in those forms \\nin which cilia are lost in the adults the infraciliary system is retained. \\nNutrition \\nNutrition is a process in which food is taken in, digested, absorbed and assimilated; \\nin fact, it is the process by which the organisms derive their nutrients essential for the \\ngrowth and maintenance of their life activities. The modes of nutrition vary greatly in \\nProtozoa because of their various mode of living habits. However, in Protozoa, the nutrition \\nis of the following types: \\n1. Holozoic or Zootrophic \\nMajority of Protozoa nutrite holozoically, i.e., like animals on solid food. The food \\nof protozoa consists of micro-organism like bacteria, diatoms, rotifers, crustacean larvae, \\nother protozoans, algae, small fragments of large animals and plants, etc. This mode of \\nnutrition essentially involves the processes like intake of food, i.e., ingestion, digestion, \\nabsorption and egestion of undigested residues. \\n(a) Ingestion: The mode of food ingestion in Protozoa is characteristically referred \\nto as phagocytosis or phagotrophy. In fact, in flagellates which are colourless or who \\nhave lost their chromatophores capture food with the help of their flagella. The captured \\nfood is ingested either at definite sites on their naked bodies like Budo or through \\ncharacteristic oral apparatus like Euglena where cytostome and cy~opharynx help in \\ningestion. In some other flagellates like Perallema, special rod-like structures called trichites \\nhelp in capturing the food. In Sarcodina, pseudopodia help in food capturing by forming \\nfood cups. \\n(b) Digestion: Digestion in Protozoa is intracellular within food vacuoles. The food \\nvacuoles undergo changes in pH and in their size during digestion. At first the contents \\nof the food vacuole are acidic and the vacuoles decrease in size, during this phase living \\nprey dies. After the initial acid phase the cytoplasm of the protozoan produces enzymes \\nin an alkaline medium, the enzymes pass into the food vacuoles and the vacuoles increase \\nin size and become alkaline. Then the contents of the vacuoles are digested. In fact, \\nproteolytic and carbohydrate digesting enzymes are reported in Protozoa; the proteins areEUKARYOTA 375 \\nconverted into dipeptides in acidic medium and the dipeptides into amino-acids in \\nalkaline medium. The carbohydrates are hydrolysed in alkaline medium. The fat digesting \\nenzymes have also been reported in some Protozoa. \\n(c) Absorption and assimilation: The digested food from the food vacuole is diffused \\nout into the endoplasm and finally assimilated in the body to manufacture the protoplasm. \\nThe excess of food is stored in form of glycogen paramylon, paraglycogen bodies in the \\nendoplasm. \\n(d) Egestion: The undigestible remains of the food are egested out from the body \\nat any body surface, eg., in Amoeba. But ciliates possess a definite opening for the egestion \\nof undigested remains called cytoproct or cytopyge. . \\n2. Pinocytosis \\nPinocytois or cell-drinking has also been reported in some Protozoa like Amoeba \\nproteus, and also in certain flagellates and ciliates. It is related to the ingestion of liquid \\nfood by invagination of the general body surface. It may occur at any part of the body; \\nduring pinocytosis, some pinocytic channels are formed from the outer body surface deep \\ninto the body. The inner ends of these channels contain pinocytic vesicles or pinosomes \\nwhich get separated after engulfing liquid food through the channels. The separated \\npinosomes become the food vacuoles. This process is induced in presence of certain salts \\nand some proteins. \\n3. Autotrophic or Holophytic Nutrition \\nProtozoa with chlorophyll or some allied pigment can manufacture complex organic \\nfood, like those of green plants, from simple inorganic substances, e.g., Euglena, Noctiluca. \\nOften there may be protein bodies called pyrenoids which are the centres of photosynthesis. \\nSome protozoa have no chromatophores but they have chlorophyll-bearing algae \\nZooxantllellae or Zooc1zlorellae which manufacture organic food for the host by photosynthesis, \\ne.g., Ste1ltor, Paramaecium bursaria. Nitrates or ammonium compounds are sufficient as the \\nsource of nitrogen for autotrophic forms. \\n4. Saprozoic Nutrition \\nSome Protozoa absorb complex organic substances in solution through the body \\nsurface by the process of osmosis called osmotrophy. These protozoa are called saprozoic. \\nSaprozoic forms need ammonium salts, amino acids, or peptones for their nutritional \\nrequirements. Decaying of animals and plants in water forms protein and carbohydrates. \\nThe saprozoic Protozo,!-are usually parasites like MonoClJstis. \\n5. Parasitic Nutrition \\nThe parasitic forms feed either holozoically or saprozoically. Thus, the parasites \\nmay be grouped into two categories on the nature of food and their mode of feeding: \\n(i) Food - robbers: The parasites feeding upon the undigested or digested food stuffs \\nof their hosts are known as food-robbers, such as some ciliate parasities like Nyctot/zems, \\nBalantidium. \\n(ii) Pathogenic: The protozoan parasites causing harm to their hosts, usually feed \\nupon the living tissues of the host. They absorb liquid food through their general body \\nsurface eg., TnJPanosoma, Plasmodium, etc.376 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n6. Coprozoic Nutrition \\nCertain free-living protozoans are in habit of feeding upon the faecal matters of the \\nother organisms like ClamydophnJs and Dimastigamoeba. \\n7. Mixotrophic Nutrition \\nSome protozoa nourish themselves ,by more than one method at the same time or \\nat different times due to change in environment. This is called mixotrophic nutrition, e.g., \\nEuglena gracilis and Perallema are both saprozoic and autotrophic in their nutrition, and \\nsome flagellates are both autorophic and zootrophic. \\nREPRODUCTION \\nThe mode of reproduction in protozoa is highly variable among different group \\nalthough it is primarily a cell division. Protozoa reproduce both asexually and sexually. \\nAsexual Reproduction \\n1. Equal or binary fission: Equal or binary fission takes place for reproducing and \\nalso for gamete formation. Usually there is a centriole within the nucleus, b\\'.lt unlike \\nmetazoa no asters are formed, moreover the nuclear membrane persists intact during \\ndivision in most Protozoa. The nucleus elongates and divides amitotically into two parts \\nwhich travel apart, then the cell constricts in the middle to form two daughter cells. \\nMacronuclei of ciliates divide amitotically. Binary fission is simple in Sarcodina like \\nAmoeba where the plane of division is not definite and it is usually transverse in ciliates \\nlike Paramecium but in most flagellates like Euglena it is longitudinal in which the nucleus \\nelongate~ transversely, but the cell divides length wise, while binary fission is oblique \\nin certain cases like Ceratiu1ll. In binary fission (in flagellates) a single flagellum is retained \\nusually by one daughter cell, and the basal granule divided into two, the new basal \\ngranule forms a flagellum in the other daughter cell. When there are many flagella they \\nare distributed among the daughter cells which grow new flagella to co~plete the number. \\nCilia are shared by daughter cells and new cilia are formed by kinetosomes to complete \\nthe number. Chromatophores usually divide but contractile vacuoles rarely divide, they \\nare generally shared or are made anew. Complex organelles are destroyed and then re\\xad\\nmade in the daughter cells. \\n2. Multiple Fission: The nucleus divides repeatedly without division of the cytoplasm, \\nlater the cytoplasm separates into as many parts as there are nuclei, usually some residual \\ncytoplasm is left unsegmented. If multiple fission produces four or more young ones by \\nequal cell division, and the young ones do not separate till the process is completed, then \\nsuch cell division is spoken of as repeated fission, e.g., Vorticella. Multiple fission produces \\nsmall cells which may grow into adults or they may become gametes which require \\nfertilization to form sporozoites (Plasmodium). The multiple fission may lead either to \\nasexual or sexual reproduction. \\n3. Plasmotomy: An asexual division of a multinucleate animal in which the \\ncytoplasm divides but the nuclei do not is called plasmotomy (Opalina, Pelomyxa). Later \\neach daughter cell regains the normal number of nuclei by nuclear division.EUKARYOTA 377 \\n4. Budding: An unequal division of the parent body produces one or more buds \\nwhich may separate from the parent, the nucleus of the bud is a part of the parent nucleus, \\ne.g., Arcella. The bud is smaller than the parent; the buds may grow into adults or may \\nbecome gametes. When buds are formed on the surface of the parent, then this is known \\nas exogenous budding, e.g., Noctiluca produces hundreds of buds on its surface as small \\nprotuberances. When the buds are formed inside the cytoplasm and may remain within \\nthe parent, then the process is called endogenous budding, e.g, Arcella. Endogenous \\nbudding may be a method of asexual reproduction or it may bring about formation of \\ngametes, eg., Arcella becomes multinucleate, protoplasm collects around the nuclei to form \\nmany amoebulae which escape from the parent and grow into adults. \\n5. parthenogenesis: Parthenogenesis is the ability of the gametes to develop into \\nadults without fertilization by gametes of the opposite sex, the gamete possessing this \\npower is almost always the female one, e.g, in Actinophnjs two individuals get enclosed \\nin a cyst, each divides to form two gametes, one gamete of an individual conjugates with \\na gamete of the other individual, the remaining gamete of each individual develops \\nparthenogenetically into an adult. Thus, gametes which have been unable to undergo cross \\nfertilization develop by parthenogenesis. Potential gametes of Chlamydomonas will grow \\nand divide to become adults when they have missed syngamy. Endomixis of ciliates is \\nalso a parthenogenetic phenomenon. The chromosome condition in parthenogenesis may \\nbe expected to be haploid since no fertilization occurs, but it is generally diploid. \\n6. Regeneration: Regeneration is the capacity to form new tissues to replace a lost \\npart, this capacity varies inversely with the complexity of an organism. In protozoa any \\nnucleated portion is capable of regeneration, while non-nucleated portions are not, e.g, \\nStentor has a long chain-like nucleus, if the animal is cut transversely into say three parts, \\nthen each piece having a portion of the nucleus will regenerate the missing portions and \\nthree Stentors will be formed. \\nSexual Reproduction \\nSexual reproduction occurs by the following methods in Protozoa: \\n1. Syngamy ot\\' copulation: Syngamy is the union and complete fusion of two gametes \\nof the same species. If the two gametes are identical morphologically, though they may \\nbe different physiologically, then they are isogametes and their syngamy is isogamy \\n(MonOCljstis). If the gametes differ in size and morphology, then they ar~ anisogametes and \\ntheir syng2my is anisogamy (Plasmodium). The smaller, usually numerous and motile \\ngametes are male or microgametes; the larger, generally few and inactive gametes are \\nfemale or macrogametes. Meiosis or reduction division occurs generally in the formation \\nof gametes, but in many flagellates meiosis is post-zygotic, that is, it occurs after the \\nformation of the zygote. The fusion of two gametes produces a zygote, its nucleus is formed \\nby the fusion of nuclei of gametes, and it is called a synkaryon. The zygote may develop \\ndirectly into an adult, or it may encyst and undergo multiple fission. Syngamy whether \\nisogamous or anisogamous is always exogamous, that is, the fusing gametes come from \\ndifferent parents, hence, sex distinction may be said to exist in Protozoa, though sexes \\nmay not be distinguished.378 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n2. Conjugation: Conjugation is a temporary union of two Protozoa of the same \\nspecies for an exchange of nuclear material without the fusion of their cytoplasm, e.g, \\nin Paramecium caudataum. In ciliates there is no formation of distinct gametes. \\nA sexual process somewhat intermediate between syngamy & conjugation occurs \\nin Vorticella in which one individual forms one to four microgametes by repeated fission, \\nand the other individual forms a macrogamete by nuclear modification, the macrogamete \\nis a hologamete because it is not formed by fission. Thus, Vorticella shows sexual \\ndimorphism in its gametes, a microgamete fuses with a macrogamete to form a zygote. \\nThe zygote by three divisions produces seven cells which grow into adults. \\nIn both syngamy and conjugation there is a rejuvenation of the animal by \\nreplacement of the macronucleus with material from the synkaryon, both processes \\nproduce new types of individuals by combination of genes, hence they give the race a \\nbetter chance of survival. \\n3. Automixis: In some Protozoa the nucleus divides into two, the two nuclei fuse \\ntogether, this is called automixis. If the two nuclei which fuse are present in a single cell, \\nthen the process is called autogamy, but if the two fusing nuclei are present in two different \\ncells, then the process is known as paedogamy. Autogamy occurs in a single Paramecium \\naurelia which provides both the fusing nuclei to form a synkaryon. Paedogamy occurs \\nin Actinosphaerium and Actinophnjs in which two cells of a secondary cyst and their two \\nremaining nuclei fuse to form a zygote which reproduces by binary fission. \\nSexual reproduction of Protozoa differs from the sexual reproduction of metazoa \\nin that the protozoan is both somatic and gametic. For many generations there is a somatic \\nphase in which binary fission occurs, then one generation is gametic in which syngamy \\nor conjugation takes place. The function of binary fission is reproduction or increasing \\nthe number of individuals, and the function of syngamy or conjugation is rejuvenation, \\nbut not reproduction although it is called \\'Sexual reproduction\\'. In the life cycle of some \\nprotozoa binary fission alternates with syngamy, this alternation may have regular sexual \\nand asexual generations (Elphidium), but more usually binary fission is repeated for many \\ngenerations continuously, and it is broken only occasionally by syngamy or conjugation. \\nProbably the occasional conjugation occurs only when the physiological condition of the \\nanimal becomes different from normal (Parall~\\'ecium). \\n4. Endomixis: It is a type of nuclear reorganization which usually occurs when \\nconjugation is prevented. In this case fusion of pro-nuclei does not take place. But the \\nmacronucleus is reorganized from micronuclear material. The reorganized macronucleus \\naccelerates the metabolic activities of the individual and helps in the renewal of the vigour \\nas is reported in Paramecium aurelia. \\n5. Hemixis: It has been reported in the various species of Paramecium like P. caudatum, \\nP. aurelia and P. multi11licrOllucleatu11l. In this case, the macronucleus throws away its many \\nfragments of different sizes in the cytoplasm which are absorbed in it. The left out part \\nof macronucleus, then starts behaving in a normal way and becomes the fresh macronucleus. \\nThe micronucleus, however, plays no part in hemixis and remains inactive and unchanged \\nduring this process.EUKARYOTA 379 \\nParasitism in Protozoa \\nThe relationship between two organisms may be symbiosis, commensalisms, or \\nparasitism. \\nSymbiosis is a relationship in which there is reciprocal benefit between one animal \\ncalled a symbiont and the other called a host, the symbiont lives in the body of the host, \\ne.g, Trichonympha lives in the gut of termites in symbiotic relationship, Trichonympha \\nobtains food & lodging, & in return it digests the wood eaten by termites, the termites \\nare incapable of digesting wood. \\nCommensalism is an association in which one organism called a commensal is \\nbenefited, & the other organism known as the host is neither benefited nor harmed, eg., \\nNyctotherus is cockroach gets food from the host, but the host is not injured in any way. \\nThe distinction between symbiosis & commensalisms is not very sharp; Entamoeba coli in \\nman is usually a commensal, but it may become symbiotic when it eats up bacteria which. \\nmay be harmful to man. \\nParasitism is an association in which one organism, the parasite lives on the body \\nor inside the body and at the expense of another organism known as the host. Parasitic \\nmode of life is a secondary state, the parasites having arisen frequently and independently \\nfrom free-living ancestors. The relationship of a parasite to its host is of varying degrees \\nof intimacy, the parasite may be epizoic or endozoic. \\nThe Flagellate Protozoa: The Mastigophora \\nThe Mastigophora are protozoa that always bear flagella as the locomotor organelles. \\nIn contrast to the ciliates, in which cell division is transverse, flagellate protozoa undergo \\nlongitudinal division. This mode of division has already been described for a photosynthetic \\nflagellate, Euglena. In addition to leucophytes, this protozoan group includes many \\nrepresentatives that show no resemblance to photosynthetic flagellates and are for the most \\npart parasites of animals. \\nThe trypanosomes are frequently parasitic in vertebrates, where they develop in the \\nbloodstream, being transmitted from host to host by the bite of insects. The cell is slender \\nand leaf-shaped, its single flagellum being directed posteriorly and attached through part \\nof its length to the body of the cell, to form an undulating membrane. The trypanosomes \\nare osmotrophic protozoa, which absorb their nutrients from the blood of the host. \\nOther parasitic flagellates inhabit the gut of vertebrates or invertebrates. The \\ntrichomonads, which have four to six flagella are harmless inhabitants of the gut of \\nvertebrates. \\nThe Amoeboid Protozoa: The Rhizopoda \\nThe Rhizopoda are protozoa in which ameboid locomotion is the predominant mode \\nof cell movement, although some of them are able to produce flagella as well. The simplest \\nmembers of this group are amebae, which have characteristically amorphous cells as a \\nresult of the continuous changes of shape brought about by the extension of psedudopodia.380 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMost amebae are free-living soil or water organisms that phagocytize smaller prey. A few \\ninhabit the animal gut, including forms that cause disease (amebic dysentery). Other \\nmembers of the Rhizopoda have a well-defined cell form, as the -result of the formation \\nof an exoskeleton or shell (typical of the foraminifera) or an endoskeleton (typical of the \\nheliozoan and radiolaria). \\nThe Ciliate Protozoa: The Ciliophora \\nThe ciliate protozoa are a very large and varied group of aquatic, phagotrophic \\norganisms that are particular widely distributed in fresh water. The ciliates share a number \\nof fundamental cellular characters that distinguish them sharply from all other protests. \\nThis suggest that despite the very great internal diversity of this group, it is one class \\nof protozoa that may have had a single common evolutionary origin. \\nAt some time in the life history, the cell is motile by means of numerous short, hair \\nlike projections, structurally homologous with flagella, which are termed cilia. Each cilium \\narises from a basal structure, the kinetosome, which is homologous with the kinetosome \\nof a flagellum; however, in ciliates the kinetosomes are inter connected by rows of fibrils \\ncalled kinetodesmata to form very elaborate compound locomotor structures termed kineties. \\nThis internal system persists, even if the cell is devoid of cilia. \\nCLASSIFICATION \\nThe classification followed here is given by the committee on Taxonomy & \\nTaxonomic problems of the society of protozoologists (Honigberg et al. 1964).

IndiaPREFACE \\nMicro-organisms are the oldest inhabitants of earth. They are masters in versality \\nand adaptability to the changing environment. They will definitely prove to be most cost\\xad\\neffective partners in our efforts for sustainable development. The microorganisms influence \\nthe man in several ways. The diversity of their activities varies from causing diseases \\nin human and other animals and plants to the production of various useful products. \\nMicrobes have a very significant role in the era of biotechnology and hence microbiology \\nhas today come forth as one of the most demanding subject in the science stream of \\ngraduate and post graduate courses. \\nThe contents of the present book have been divided into 17 chapters covering basic \\nstudies of microorganisms excluding their application part. Book covers detailed information \\non history of microbiology, evolution of microorganisms, classification, Nomenclature and \\nlatest information of Bergey\\'s manual. Chapter covers information about structure, \\nmetabolism reproduction, function and diseases caused by Bacteria, Viruses, Bacterial \\nviruses, Plant viruses, Animal viruses, Archaea, Mycoplasma and Phytoplasma. General \\naccount of cyanobacteria including their nutrition and reproduction have been given. Book \\nprovides detailed information about Gram negative and Gram positive Bacteria and \\nEukaryotes viz.

Because most of \\nthe microorganisms are only a few thousands of a mm in size, they can only be seen \\nwith the aid of microscope. Due to the invisibility of microbes tc the naked eye and \\nthe need for special techniques to study them, microbiology was the last of the three \\nmajor divisions in biology (the other two are botany and zoology) to develop. \\nAt present there is general agreement to include five major groups as microorganisms. \\nThe subdivisions are : \\nMicrobiology \\nVirology \\n(Viruses) \\nBacteriology \\n(Bacteria) \\nI \\nMycology \\n(Fungi) \\nI \\nPhycology \\n(Algae) \\nProtozoology \\n(Protozoa) \\nMicroorganisms are present everywhere on earth which includes humans, animals, \\nplants and other living creatures, soil, water and atmosphere.

Microorganism play an important role in the recycling of organic and \\ninorganic material through their roles in the C, Nand S cycles, thus playing an important \\npart in the maintenance of the stability of the biosphere. They are also the source of \\nnutrients at the base of all ectotropical food chains and webs.

These interactions include: ecology, genetics, metabolism, infection, disease, \\nchemotherapy, immunology, genetic engineering, industry and agriculture.

The term \\nmicrobiology was given by French chemist Louis Pasteur (1822-95). \\nMicrobiology is said to have its roots in the great expansion a:r:td development of \\nthe biological sciences that took place after 1850. The term microbe was first used by \\nSedillot (1878). \\nMicroorganism were first living things to appear on earth and the study of fossil\\xad\\nremains indicate that microbial infections and epidemic diseases existed thousands of \\nyears ago. Varo and Columella in the first century BC postulated that diseases w~re \\ncaused by invisible beings (Animalia minuta) inhaled or ingested. Fracastorius of \\nVerona (1546) proposed a contagium vivum as a possible cause of infections disease \\nand Von Plenciz (1762) suggested that each disease was caused by a separate agent. \\nRogen Bacon in the 13th century postulated that disease is produced by invisible \\nliving creatures. This suggestion was made again in 1546 by a physician Girolamo \\nFracastoro (1478-1553) of North Italy. He wrote a treatise-De contagione in which he \\nsaid disease was caused by minute \\'seed\\' or \\'germ\\' and spread from person to person. \\nHis work represents a great landmark in the doctorine of infectious diseases. \\nIn 1665, Robert Hook an English scientist used a simple lens that magnified objects \\napproximately 30X. He examined thin slices of cork, the bark of oak tree and he referred \\nto as \"cells\". Later the Hook work was followed by Matthias Schleiden and Theodore \\nSchwann who examined a variety of organisms and later became foundation of \"Cell \\nTheory\". The discovery of microbiology as a discipline could be\" traced along the \\nfollowing historical eras : \\nDiscoverv \\nf,ra \\nTransition \\nPeriod \\nI \\nGolden \\nAge \\nI \\nIn 20th Century: \\nEra of Molecular BiologyHISTORY OF MICROBIOLOGY 5 \\nDISCOVERY ERA \\nThis period concerns with the discovery of microbial world that has been dominated \\nby Antony Van Leeuvenhoek \\nAntony Van Leeuvenhoek (1632-1723) of Delft, Holland (Netherland) was the first \\nperson to observe and accurately describe microorganisms (bacteria and protozoa) called \\n\\'animalcules\\' (little animals) in 1676. Actually he was a Dutch linen merchant but spent \\nmuch of his spare time constructing simple microscopes composed of double convex \\nlenses held between two silver plates. He constructed over 250 small powerful \\nmicroscopes that could magnify around 50-300 times. Leeuvenhoek was the 1st person \\nto produce precise and correct descriptions of bacteria and protozoa using microscope \\nhe made himself. Because of this extraordinary contribution to microbiology he is \\nconsidered as the \"Father of bacteriology and protozoology\". He wrote over 200 letters \\nwhich was transmitted as a series of letters from 1674-1723 to Royal society in London \\nduring a 50 years period. He wrote four volumes of Arcana Naturae opeet Beneficio \\nExquisite Simom11l Mierovopionun Deteeta. \\nTRANSITION PERIOD \\nAlthough, there were a number of Significant developments in microbiology during \\nVan Leeuvenhoek\\'s time, Peoples were interested to correlate diseases with microbes. \\nThe main aspects were to solve the controversy over spontaneous generation which \\nincludes experimentations mainly of Francesco Redi, John Needham, Lazzaro Spallanzani \\nand Nicolas Appert etc and to know the disease transmission which mainly includes \\nthe work of Ignaz Semmelweis and John Snow. \\nFrancesco Redi (1626-1697): The ancient belief in spontaneous generation was first \\nof all challenged by Redi, an Italian physician, who carried out a series of experiments \\non decaying meat and its ability to produce maggots spontaneously. Redi was the first \\nwho put the theory of spontaneous generation to test by conducting a simple experiment \\nin which he placed meat in three jars. One jar was covered with fine gauze, second \\nwas covered with paper and third was left uncovered. Flies entered the jar that was \\nopen to air i.e. left uncovered and landed on meat where they laid their egg that later \\ndeveloped into maggots. The other two pieces of meat did not produce maggots \\nspontaneously. However flies were attracted to the gauze covered jars and laid their \\neggs on the gauze and maggots subsequently developed without access to the meat, \\nindicating that maggots were the offspring of the flies and did not arise from some \\n\\'vital source\\' in the meat as previously believed. \\nJohn Needham (1713-1781): He was probably the greatest supporter of the theory \\nof spontaneous generation. He proposed that tiny organisms the animalcules arose \\nspontaneously on his mutton gravy. He covered the flasks with cork as done by Redi \\nand even heated some flasks. Still the microbes appeared on mutton broth. \\nLazzaro Spallanzani (1729-1799): He was an Italian Naturalist who attempted to \\nrefute Needham\\'s experiment. He boiled beef broth for longer period, removed the air \\nfrom the flask and then sealed the container. Followed incubation no growth was \\nobserved by him in these flasks. He showed that the heated nutrients could still grow6 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nanimalcules when exposed to air by simply making a small crack in the neck. Thus \\nSpallanzani disproved the doctrine of spontaneous generation. \\nNicolas Appert followed the idea of Spallanzani\\'s work. He was a French wine \\nmaker who showed that soups and liquids can be preserved by heating them extensively \\nin thick champagine bottles. \\nIgnaz Semmelweis and John Snow were the two persons who showed a growing \\nawareness of the mode of disease transmission. \\nTwo German scholars Schulze (1815-1873) and Theodor Schwan (1810-1882) \\nviewed that air was the source of microbes and sought to prove this by passing air \\nthrough hot glass tubes or strong chemicals into boiled infusions in flasks. The infusion \\nin both the cases remained free from the microbes. \\nGeorge Schroeder and Theodor Von Dusch (1854) were the first to introduce the \\nidea of using cotton plugs for plugging microbial culture tubes. \\nDarwin (1859) in his book, \\'Origin of the Species\\' showed that the human body \\ncould be conceived as a creature susceptible to the laws of nature. He was of the opinion \\nthat disease may be a biological phenomenon, rather than any magic. \\n1220-1252 \\n1546 \\n1658 \\n1665 \\n1668 \\n1676 \\n1688 \\n1776 \\n1786 \\n1798 \\n1799 \\n1839 \\n1857 \\n1858 \\nTABLE 1 \\nHistorical \\nDevelopment in the Field of Microbiology \\n- Rogen Bacon, disease produced by invisible living creatures. \\n- Girolamo Fracastoro, disease was caused by minute \\'seed\\' or \\'germ\\'s \\nspread from person to person. \\n- Athanasius Kircher, 1st recognize the significance of bacteria and other \\nmicrobes in disease. \\n- Robert Hooke, referred as \\'cells\\'. \\n- Franceso Redi, demonstrate the fallacies in the spontaneous generation \\ntheory. \\n- Antony Van Leeuvenhoek discovers I animalcules\\' . \\n- Redi Publishes work on spontaneous generation of maggaot. \\n- Lazzaro Spallanzani conducts experiment that dispute spontaneous \\ngeneration. \\n- Muller produces first classification of bacteria. \\n- Edward Jenner introduces Cowpox vaccination for small pox. \\n- Spallanzani attacks on the theory of spontaneous generation. \\n- Theodor Schwann (german zoologist) and Mathias Schleiden (botanist) \\nformulate the cell theory. \\n- Pasteur shows that lactic acid fermentation is due to a microorganism. \\n- Rudolf virchow, (all cell originate from pre existing cells).HISTORY OF MICROBIOLOGY 7 \\n1861 \\n1867 \\n1869 \\n1876-77 \\n1881 \\n1882 \\n1884 \\n1885 \\n1887 \\n1892 \\n1897 \\n1899 \\n1906 \\n1908 \\n1910 \\n1915-17 \\n1923 \\n1928 \\n1929 \\n1935 \\n1944 \\n1946 \\n1952 \\n1953 \\n1954 \\n1957 \\n1958 \\n- Pasteur shows that microorganism do not arise by spontaneous generation. \\n- Lister publishes his work on antiseptic surgery. \\n- Johann Meischer discovers nucleic acids. \\n- Koch demonstrate that anthrax is caused by Bacillus allthracis. \\n- Koch cultures bacteria on gelatin. \\n- Koch discovers tubercle bacillus. \\n- Koch\\'s postulates first published. \\nMetchinikoff describes phagocytosis. \\nAutoclave developed. \\nGram stain developed. \\n- Pasteur develops rabies vaccine. \\n- Petridish developed by Richard Petri. \\n- D.

More important there was an acceptance \\nof their work by the scientific community throughout the world and a willingness to \\ncontinue and expand the work. During this period, we see the real beginning of \\nmicrobiology as a discipline of biology. \\nLouis Pasteur: Pasteur a French microbiologist, performed a series of experiments \\nto prove that microorganisms were present in the air and were not spontaneously \\nproduced. He filled several round bottomed flasks with nutrient solution and fashioned \\ntheir openings into elongated, swan neck shaped tubes. The flask\\'s opening were freely \\nopen to the air but curved so that gravity would cause any air borne dust particle to \\ndeposit in the lower parts of the neck. The flasks were heated to sterilize the broth \\nand then incubated. No growth occurred even though the contents of the flasks were \\nexposed to the air. Pasteur pointed out that no growth took place because dust and \\ngerms had been trapped on the walls of the curved necks but if the necks were broken \\noff so that dust fell directly down into the flask, microbial growth commenced \\nimmediately. Some of these ingenious little flasks are still on display at the Pasteur \\nInstitute in Paris in their original sterile form. This experiment clearly showed that \\nmicroorganisms present on or in non-living materials such as dust or water were \\nresponsible for the contamination of sterile solutions. Pasteur, thus in 1861 finallyHISTORY OF MICROBIOLOGY 9 \\nresolved the controversy of spontaneous generation versus biogenesis and proved that \\nmicroorganisms are not spontaneously generated from inanimate matter but arise from \\nother microorganisms. \\nLouis Pasteur, a professor of chemistry at the Un iversity of Lille, France. He was \\nresponsible for saving a principal industry of France i.e. manufacture of wine and beer. \\nHe found that fermentation of fruits and grains, resulting in alcohol, was brought about \\nby microbes and also determined that bacteria were responsible for the spoilage of wine \\nduring fermentation. Pasteur in 1897 suggested that mild heating at 62.8°C (145°F) for \\n30 minutes rather than boiling was enough to destroy the undesirable organisms without \\nruining the taste of the product, the process was called Pasteurization. Pasteurization \\nwas introduced into the united states on a commercial basis in 1892. His work led to \\nthe development of the germ theory of disease. \\nFig. 1 : Photograph Pasteur\\'s experiment disproving theory of spontanous generation \\nJohn Tyndall (1820 - 1893): An English physicist, deal a final blow to spontaneous \\ngeneration in 1877. He conducted experiments in an aseptically designed box to prove \\nthat dust indeed carried the germs . He demonstrated that if no dust was present, sterile \\nbroth remained free of microbial growth for indefinite period even if it was directly \\nexposed to air. He discovered highly resistant bacterial structure, later known as \\nendospore, in the infusion of hay. Prolonged boiling or intermittent heating was \\nnecessary to kill these spores, to make the infusion completely sterilized, a process known \\nas Tyndallisation. \\nLord Joseph Lister (1827-1912): a famous English surgeon is known for his notable \\ncontribution to the antiseptic treatment for the prevention and cure of wound infections. \\nLister concluded that wound infections too were due to microorganisms. In 1867, he10 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\ndeveloped a system of antiseptic surgery designed to prevent mi<;roorganisms from \\nentering wounds by the application of phenol on surgical dressings and at times it was \\nsprayed over the surgical areas. He also devised a method to destroy microorganisms \\nin the operation theatre by spraying a fine mist of carbolic acid into the air, thus \\nproducing an antiseptic environment. Thus Joseph Lister was the first to introduce aseptic \\ntechniques for control of microbes by the use of physical and chemical agents which \\nare still in use today. Because of this notable contributions, Joseph Lister is known as \\nthe Father of Antiseptic surgery. \\nRobert Koch (1893-1910) gave the first direct demonstration of the role of bacteria \\nin causing disease. He was a german physician who first of all isolated anthrax bacillus \\n(Bacillus alltlzracis, the cause of anthrax) in 1876. He perfected the technique of isolating \\nbacteria in pure culture. He also introduced the use of solid culture media in 1881 by \\nusing gelatin as a solidifying agent. In 1882 he discovered Mycobacterium tuberculosis. \\nHe proposed Koch postulate which were published in 1884 and are the corner stone \\nof the germ theory of diseases and are still in use today to prove the etiology (specific \\ncause) of an infectious disease. The postulates are: \\n1. The suspected microorganism must always be found in diseased but never in \\nhealthy individuals. \\n2. The microorganism must be isolated in a pure culture (one free of all other \\ntypes of microbes) on a nutrient medium. \\n3. The same disease must result when the isolated microorganism is inoculated \\ninto a healthy host. \\n4. The same organism must by reisolated from the experimentally infected host. \\nAlthough viruses and a few other microbes cannot be cultured in artificial media, \\nKoch\\'s postulates are still used today for the cause of most infectious diseases. \\nRobert Koch also used gelatin to prepare solid media but it was not an ideal \\nsolidifying agent because of the two important reasons (i) since gelatin is a protein, \\nit is digested by many bacteria capable of producing a proteolytic exoenzyme gelatinase \\nthat hydrolyses the protein to amino acids and (ii) It melts when the temperature rises \\nabove 25°C. R. Koch will be remembered for both i.e. his contribution in the discovery \\nof important disease producing microorganism and his fundamental contribution to \\nbacteriological techniques. \\nFanne Eilshemius Hesse (1850 - 1934) one of Koch\\'s assistant first proposed the \\nuse of agar in culture media. Agar was superior to gelatin because of its higher melting \\n(i.e. 96°C) and solidifying (i.e. 40-45°C) points than gelatin and was not attacked by \\nmost bacteria. Koch\\'s another assistant Richard Petri in 1887 developed the Petri dish \\n(plate), a container used for solid culture media. Thus contribution of Robert Koch, \\nFannie Fannie Hesse and Richard Petri made possible the isolation of pure cultures of \\nmicroorganisms and directly stimulated progress in all areas of microbiology. \\nEdward Jenner (1749-1823) an English physician was the first to prevent small pox. \\nHe was impressed by the observation that countryside milk maid who contacted cowpox \\n(Cowpox is a milder disease caused by a virus closely related to small pox) while milkingHISTORY OF MICROBIOLOGY 11 \\nwere subsequently immune to small pox. On May 14th, 1796 he proved that inoculating \\npeople with pus from cowpox lesions provided protection against small pox. Jenner in \\n1798, published his results on 23 successful vaccinators. Eventually this process was \\nknown as vaccination, based on the latin word \\'Vacca\\' meaning cow. Thus the use of \\ncow pox virus to protect small pox disease in humans became popular replacing the \\nrisky technique of immunizing with actual small pox material. \\nJenner\\'s experimental significance was realized by Pasteur who next applied this \\nprinciple to the prevention of anthrax and it worked. He called the attenuated cultures \\nvaccines (Vacca = cow) and the process as vaccination. Encouraged by the successful \\nprevention of anthrax by vaccination, Pasteur marched ahead towards the service of \\nhumanity by making a vaccine for hydrophobia or rabies (a disease transmitted to people \\nby bites of dogs and other animals). As with Jenner\\'s vaccination for small pox, principle \\nof the preventive treatment of rabies also worked fully which laid the foundation of \\nmodern immunization programme against many dreaded diseases like diphtheria, \\ntetanus, pertussis, polio and measles etc. \\nElie Metchnikoff (1845-1916) proposed the phagocytic theory of immunity in 1883. \\nHe discovered that some blood leukocytes, white blood cells (WBC) protect against \\ndisease by engulfing disease causing bacteria. These cells were called phagocytes and \\nthe process phagocytosis. Thus human blood cells also confer immunity, referred to as \\ncellular immunity. \\nEmile Roux (1853-1933) and Alexandre Yersin, the two notable French bacteriologists \\ndemonstrated the production of toxin in filtrates of broth cultures of the diphtheria \\norganism. Emil von Behring (1854 -1917) and Shibasaburo Kitasato (1852-1931) both \\ncolleagues of Robert Koch, in 1890 discovered tetanus (lock jaw) antitoxin. Only about \\na week after the announcement of the discovery of tetanus antitoxin, Von Behring in \\n1890 reported on immunization against diphtheria by diphtheria antitoxin. The discovery \\nof toxin-antitoxin relationship was very important to the development of science of \\nimmunology. \\nWhile all these milestones were being laid in the field of microbiology, an English \\nsurgeon, Joseph Lister (1827-1912) was trying to combat the microbes that caused post \\noperative and wound infection disaster searched for a way to keep bacteria out of \\nwounds and the incisions made by surgeons. He used a dilute solution of carbolic acid \\nto soak surgical dressings that kept the wounds free from microbial infection and healing \\ntook place rapidly. So remarkable was his success that the technique was quickly \\naccepted and the principle of present day aseptic technique was established. \\nPaul Ehrlich (1854-1915) in 1904 found that the dye Trypan Red was active against \\nthe trypanosome that causes African sleeping sickness and could be used therapeutically. \\nThis dye with antimicrobial activity was referred to as a \\'magic bullet\\'. Subsequently \\nin 1910, Ehrlich in collaboration with Sakahiro Hata, a japanese physician, introduced \\nthe drug Salvarsan (arsenobenzol) as a treatment for syphilis caused by Treponema \\npallidu11l. Ehrlich\\'s work had laid important foundations for many of the developments \\nto come and the use of Salvarsen marked the beginning of the eni of chemotherapy \\nand the use of chemicals that selectively inhibit or kill pathogens without causing damage \\nto the patient.12 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nGerhard Domagk of Germany in 1935 experimented with numerous synthetic dyes \\nand reported that Prontosil, a red dye used for staining leather, was active against \\npathogenic, Streptococci and Staphylococci in mice even though it had no effect against \\nthat same infectious agent in a test tube. In the same year two French scientists Jacques \\nand Therese Trefonel showed that the compound Prontosil was broken down within \\nthe body of the animal to sulfanilamide (Sulfa drug) the true active factor. Domagk \\nwas awarded nobel prize in 1939 for the discovery of the first sulpha drug. \\nThe credit for the discovery of first \\'wonder drug\\' penicillin in 1929 goes to Sir \\nAlexander Fleming of England, a Scottish physician and bacteriologist. Fleming had \\nbeen actually interested in searching something that would kill pathogens ever since \\nworking on wound infections during the first world war (1914-1918). One day in 1928 \\nupon his return from a week\\'s vacation, Fleming observed that a plate of Staphylococcus \\naureus had become contaminated with a green mold Penicillium notahHn which had \\naccidentially fallen in plate.

Observing this plate, Fleming noted that the colonies of \\nStaphylococcus bacterium were evidently being destroyed by the nearby Penicillium \\ncolonies. Rather than discarding the contaminated plate, he speculated that the mold \\nwas producing a diffusible substance that inhibited the bacterial growth. Fleming isolated \\nand subcultured the mold for further study. He extracted from the fungus a compound \\nwhich he called penicillin, after the name of the producer organism Penicillium notaium, \\nthat could destroy several pathogenic bacteria. Thus, Sir Alexander Fleming in 1929 \\ndiscovered the first antibiotic (Gr. Anti = against + bios = life, the microbial products \\nthat can kill susceptible microorganism and inhibit their growth) penicillin. The \\ncommercial production of penicillin in the USA began in 1941 Fleming, Florey and Chain \\nshared the nobel prize in 1945 for the discovery and production of penicillin.

Waksman at the Rutgers university, USA discovered another antibiotic, streptomycin \\nproduced by two strains of actinomycete, Streptomyces griseus in 1944. Waksman received \\nthe noble prize in 1952 for his discovery of Streptomycin used in the treatment of \\ntuberculosis, a bacterial disease ca\\'..lsed by Mycobateriu11l tuberculosis that had been \\ndiscovered by Robert Koch in 1882. By 1950, three other microorganism were identified \\nthat produced antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin) from Streptomyces \\nvenezuelae by Dr. Paul R. Burkholder in 1947, Aureomycin from S. aureofaciens by Dr. \\nB.M. Dugger in 1948; and Terramycin from S. rimosus by Finlay, Hobby and collaborators \\nin 1950. \\nA dramatic turn in microbiology research was signaled by the death of Robert Koch \\nin 1910 and advent of world war I. The Pasteur Institute was closed, and the german \\nlaboratories converted for production of blood components used to treat war infections. \\nThus came to an end what many have called the Golden Age of Microbiology. \\nIN 20~ CENTURY: ERA OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY \\nBy the end of 1900, science of microbiology grew up to the adolescence stage and \\nhad come to its own as a branch of the more inclusive field of biology. In the laterHISTORY OF MICROBIOLOGY 13 \\nyears the microorganism were picked up as ideal tools to study various life processes \\nand thus an independent discipline of microbiology, molecular biology was born. The \\nrelative simplicity of the microorganism, their short life span and the genetic homogeneity \\nprovided an authentic simulated model to understand the physiological, biochemical \\nand genetical intricacies of the living organisms. The use of microorganisms as a tool \\nto explore fundamental life processes became attractive due to the following facts: \\n1. They reproduce (grow) very rapidly. \\n2. Can be cultured in small and vast quantities conveniently and rapidly. \\n3. Their growth can be manipulated easily by physical and chemical means and \\ntheir cells can be broken apart or the contents can be separated into fractions \\nof various particle sizes. Because of these characteristics microorganisms were \\nused as research models to determine exactly how various life processes take \\nplace in terms of specific reactions and the specific structures involved. \\nThe list of those who contributed to the development of microbiology is far too \\nlong to recite here in its entirety. Here we shall highlight briefly only few of the important \\nmicrobiological accomplishments. \\nGeorge W. Beadle and Edward 1. Tatum both US Scientists, were the pioneers \\nin the area of microbial genetics. They studied the relationship between genes and \\nenzymes in 1941 using mutants of the bread mold fungus, Neurospora crassa and gave \\nthe concept of one-gene -one enzyme hypothesis. Using mutants of Neurospora, they \\ndemonstrated that there was a direct relationship between a single gene and a single \\nenzyme. Beadle and Tatum hypothesized that the synthesis of the compounds essential \\nfor cell growth must be under genetic control. They also concluded that a defect in \\none gene produced a single defect in an essential enzyme resulting in the growth factor \\nrequirement, that is one gene one - enzyme theory. Lederberg, Beadle and Tatum were \\nawarded the nobel prize in 1958 for the discovery of one gene one enzyme hypothesis. \\nMax Delbruck and Salvadore Luria in 1943 described the genetic nature of viruses. \\nThey also proved that gene mutations were truly spontaneous and not directed by the \\nenvironment. DNA is the genetic material and carried genetic information during \\ntransformation in bacteria was demonstrated in 1944 by Oswald, T. Avery, Colin. M. \\nMaclead and Maclyn McCarty. In 1952 Joshua Lederberg first of all introduced the term \\n\\'Plasmid\\' to describe nonchromosomal genetic material in bacteria. In collaboration with \\nNorton Zinder, a student in his laboratory at Wisconsin, USA, Lederberg discovered \\nthat genetic information could be transferred between bacteria by bacteriophage this \\nprocess was known as transduction. Lederberg along with his wife Esther, developed \\na unique method of studying bacterial mutants, now known as \\'replica plating\\' using \\nthis method it is possible to transfer bacterial colonies from one agar growth plate to \\nother so that each new plate is an exact replica of the original. With this technique, \\nLederberg showed that mutations in bacteria occur randomly and spontaneously. Thus \\ndiscovery made by Lederberg in bacterial genetics - transduction and conjugation in \\nbacteria have made the science of bacterial genetics and have subsequently spawned \\nmany advances including aspects of modern molecular genetics of gene cloning. Thus \\nJ. Lederberg single handedly changed the nature of bacterial genetics and biochemistry.14 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nWatson and Crick in 1953 made most remarkable discovery in genetics by discovering \\nthe molecular structure of DNA providing framework for understanding molecular basis\\' \\nof inheritance and expression of genetic information. Ochoa and Kornberg isolated and \\nsynthesized the enzyme, responsible for production of ribonucleic acids, RNA and DNA \\nthat carry hereditary information for which they received nobel prize in 1959. \\nIn 1968, the nobel prize for physiology and medicine was shared by Robert W. Holley, \\nHargovind Khorana and M.W. Nirenberg for their contribution to the understanding of \\nthe genetic code and its function in protein synthesis. The 1969 nobel prize in medicine \\nand physiology was awarded to Max Dalbruck, Alfred D. Hershey and S.E. Luria for \\nstudying the replication mechanism and genetic structure of bactriophage. Albert Claude, \\nG.E. Palade, Christian D. Duve jointly received the prestigious nobel prize of 1974 for \\nthe isolation of cell parts in order to study the structure and chemistry of individual cell \\nwhich led to the discoveries of ribosome and lysosome. In the following year, 1975 R. \\nDulbeco, HM. Temin and David Baltimore of u.s.A. were awarded the nobel prize for \\nresearching the interaction between tumor virus and genetic material of the cell. In 1976, \\nGajdusek and Blumberg did research leading to nobel prize for a test to show hepatitis \\nvirus in donated blood and to a experimental vaccine against the disease. Two years later, \\nArber, Smith and Nathans were jointly awarded this prize for discovery of restriction \\nenzyme and their application to the problems of molecular genetics. \\nA number of nobel laureates in medicine and physiology awarded the nobel prize \\nfor their work in microbiology. \\nTABLE 2 \\nNobel Laureates in Microbiology \\nYear Nobel laureate Research work \\n1901 Emil A.

The planets and stars, the earth\\'s topography the chemical \\ncompounds of the universe and chemical elements and their sub-atomic particles have \\nundergone gradual and orderly changes is termed as inorganic evolution. The term \\norganic evolution states that all the various plants and animals existing at present time \\nhave descended from other generally the simpler organism by gradual modification \\nwhich have accumulated in successive generations. The major trend in the evolution \\nis been towards increased adaptation to some particular environment, and this has \\nfrequently involved increased specializations and complexity of structures and their \\nfunctions. \\nLife originated on earth millions of years ago and since then innumerable varieties \\nof living beings have evolved but this living matter cannot have existed all the time, \\non the earth. The high temperature and dry climate of the early time of earth would \\nhave made living matter impossible to exist. \\nThe origin of life on earth occurs in following three steps: \\n(A) ORIGIN OF UNIVERSE \\nMan has been speculating on the origin of the earth for thousands of years. Certain \\nelaborate hypothesis of earth origin have played a significant role in the development \\nof geologic theory regarding the origin of universe as well as earth. The various \\nhypothesis proposed are as follows: \\n1. The Nebular hypothesis - given by Immanuel Kant (1755) and Pierre Simon \\nde laplace (1796)18 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n2. The Planetesimal hypothesis - given by Thomas. C. Chamberlin and Forest. R. \\nMoulton (1895) \\n3. The Tidal hypothesis - James Jeans and Harold Leffires (1917) \\n4. Recent hypothesis \\n1. The Nebular Hypothesis \\nThe nebular hypothesis of Kant and Laplace is referred to as a star hypothesis. \\nThe hypothesis postulates that a greatly diffused spherical doud of gas a nebula, \\nextended outward at least to the present distance of the outer most planet. This cloud \\nrotated slowly as it cooled and contracted its velocity around the sun increased. The \\ngaseous mass gradually became a disk around the sun\\'s equator during this rotation, \\nrings of fiery gas were assumed to have been thrown off centrifugal force. Each ring \\nthan broke up and gathered into a sphere producing a planet which began to revolve \\naround the sun the same path as the former ring. The earth planet liquefied as it cooled, \\nthen with further cooling acquired a solid crust. The main body of the gas mean while \\ncondensed further to become the sun. \\nThe serious objections to the nebular hypothesis are: \\n1. The planets possess 98% of the rotational energy of the solClr system, whereas \\nthe sun has about 99.87% of the mass. \\n2. The heavy elements in the earth can originate only at temperatures for higher \\nthan those prevailing on the sun. \\n3. Some of the satellites revolve in a backward direction and one of them revolves \\nfaster than its planet rotates. \\n4. The mechanism of ring formation does not correspond to rotational velocity \\nof a solar nebula as postulated. \\n2. The Planetsimal Hypothesis \\nThe planetesimal hypothesis of Chamberlain and Moulton is referred to as a two \\nstar hypothesis. It explains the origin of the planets by a near collision between the \\nsun and another star which disrupted it. This hypothesis has many serious objections. \\n3. The Tidal Hypothesis \\nThis hypothesis proposed by James Jeans and Harrold Leffries (1917) proposed that \\nanother star closely approached the sun, producing tidal buldges from which steamed \\nan enormous cigar shaped filament of solar gases. This incandescent filament was put \\ninto revolution around the sun. It then broke into segments which contracted into rotating \\nspheres, the planets cooling from gas to liquid one of these planets, earth gradually \\nsolidified to its present condition. \\n4. Recent Hypothesis \\nWith the development of new mathematical technique and the discovery of newEVOLUTION OF MICROORGANISM 19 \\nfacts about the universe, various cosmogonist viz. Berlage (1940), Whipple (1947) and \\nHoyle (1950) has proposed new hypothesis. The general trend is toward a modified \\nversion of the ancient nebular hypothesis. \\nAccording to nebular hypothesis about 10-20 bi11ion yrs ago, cosmos was in the \\nform of a small sphere of highly condensed mass of cosmic material, with a big bang \\nit exploded into numerous pieces called nebulae. Our solar system originated from one \\nof these nebulae. The nebula was a cold and spinning cloudy mass· of cosmic dust or \\ngases. The central mass of nebula condensed to form a primitive sun. As it condensed, \\nthe sun became hotter and brighter due to the conversion of gravitational energy into \\nheat. Higher temperature initiated thermonuclear reaction in the sun which then started \\nemitting solar radiation. \\nBecause of rotational movement of nebula, a ring of cloud got separated, spinning \\naround the central mass and condensed into planets including our earth. As the earth \\nwas formed by the condensation of nebular mass, its temperature increased due to \\ninternal pressure, gravitation and effect of solar heating. \\nThus initially the earth was a fiery spinning ball of hot gases and vapours of various \\nelements. Through hundreds, millions years, the gases condensed into a molten core \\nand different elements got stratified according to their density. The heavy elements like \\niron and nickel etc. sank to the centre and formed solid core of the earth, the lighter \\nelements like silicon and aluminum rose to the surface and solidified to form the surface \\nor crust. The part of the earth between core and crust formed mantle which is solid \\nand m~de up of iron, magnesium and silicates. \\nThe lightest ones like He, H, °2, N2 and C flowed out of the surface and formed \\nthe gaseous atmosphere. \\nThe Primitive Atmosphere of Earth \\nThe original temperature of earth was supposed to be 900°C initially. This \\ntemperature was such high that the elements like H 2, N2, °2, and C could not exist \\nin free state. These gases combined variously either among themselves or with metals \\nforming oxides, carbides and nitrides. Thus carbon formed dicarbon, cyanogens, \\nmethane, CO 2, CO and metal carbides. Nitrogen formed nitrides with metals, oxygen \\nformed oxides and H2 combined with 02 to form water, with N2 to form ammonia, \\nmethane and carbon cyanamide with carbon. \\nInitially the temperature was too high that all these compound existed in gaseous \\nstate and water as superheated steam. These formed the atmosphere of primitive earth. \\nThis atmosphere of primitive earth was unlike our present atmosphere in following \\nrespects: \\n1. Abundance of H2 : The interstellar dust from which earth originated was \\nespecially rich in H 2. It readily combined with N2 forming ammonia, with 02 to form \\nwater and methane with carbo~ The primitive earth atmosphere was highly reducing. \\n2. Absence of 02 : The atmosphere of primitive earth was non-oxygenic. The free \\noxygen was bound in water, CO, and CO 2 and in metallic oxides on the surface rocks \\nand particles. Because of the absence of free 02 and complex organic compound that \\narose during early time were not subjected to degradation.20 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n3. Absence of ozone layer: There was no layer of ozone to absorb UV rays coming \\non earth from sun. \\nLater the earth cooled gradually, some of the atmospheric gas liquefied, and some \\nof the liquid turned solid. Steam condensed into water and resulted into rain. The rain \\ndroplets on approaching the super heated earth crust immediately evaporated and \\nreturned into the atmosphere. This cycle contin:ued for millions of years and resulted \\nin the cooling of earth surface. As a result the earth surface became cool enough to \\nhold water and large water bodies/first oceans come into existence. About 3 billion \\nyrs ago the earth had a solid crust, frequently punctured by eruptions of molten rocks \\n(Volcanoes) and at places filled with hot boiling sea water. The sea water contained \\ndissolved NH3\\' methane, some minerals and salts. The primitive atmosphere of the earth \\nwas devoid of free oxygen but rich in NH 3, CH 4 and hydrogen as found in the present \\natmosphere of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. \\nThe energy for synthetic processes that occurred on primitive earth in past during \\nchemical evolution was obtained from the following sources: \\n(a) Solar radiation or UV radiation from sun formed the most abundant type of \\nfree energy available on primitive earth. \\n(b) Viol~nt electric discharge followed with lightening and thunder from clouds \\nreached the primitive earth and contributed Significantly to form various micro \\nand macro-molecules. \\n(c) Volcano eruptions produced heat which also encouraged chemical reactions. \\n(d) Ionizing radiations and cosmic rays i.e. x - rays etc also provided energy for \\nchemical evolution. \\n(B) CHEMICAL ORIGIN OF LIFE (CHEMOGENY) \\nLife did not originate at one specific spot at one specific time in the early oceans \\nof earth. Oparin suggested that from these simple compound viz. (H20, CH 4, NH 3, \\nNitrogen formed nitrides, oxides, dicarbon, CO 2 and CO) more and more complex \\norganic compounds were formed gradually under the influence of electric charges, UV \\nrays or corpuscular radiations. \\nStep-l : Origin of organic compounds. \\nStep-2 : Formation of macromolecules or complex organic molecules by the process \\nof pofymerization and condensation. \\nStep-3 : Formation of nucleic acids \\nStep-4 : Formation of nucleoproteins or protobionts. \\nStep-l : Origin of organic compounds \\nI. Formation of II. Formation of \\nhydrocarbon oxy and hydroxy \\nderivative of \\nhydrocarbon \\nIII. Formation of \\ncarbohydrate \\nIV. Formation of V. Formation of \\nfatty acids and amino acids \\nglycerolEVOLUTION OF MICROORGANISM 21 \\nI. Formation of Hydrocarbons (Micro Molecules): When the temperature of earth \\ncooled down to l,OOOoC or even lower a variety of simple hydrocarbons (saturated/ \\nunsaturated) were formed presumably by the following methods: \\nThe combination of highly reactive free radicals CH and CH 2 \\nCH + CH ~ HC = CH Acetylene \\nCH 2 + CH 2 ~ H 2C = CH 2 Ethylene \\nCH 2 + CH 2 ~ CH 4 + C Methane \\n2CH 4 ~ HC = CH +3H 2 Acetylene \\nThe metal carbides reacted with steam \\nCaC 2 + H 20 ~ HC = CH + CaO \\n3Fe4C S + 16H 20 ~ C 1sH 32 + 4Fe30 4 \\nII. Formation of oxy and hydroxyl derivative of hydrocarbons: Both saturated as \\nwell as unsaturated hydrocarbons reacted with superheated steam and formed oxy and \\nhydroxyl-derivatives such as aldehyde, ketone and acids. \\nHC = CH + H 20 ~ CH 3CHO \\nCarbon monoxide reacted with water forming formic acid. Because of its reactivity \\ncarbon monoxide is considered to have participated in the formation of prebiotic \\ncompounds. \\nCO + H 20 ~ HCOOH \\nIII. Formation of carbohydrate: Small chain compounds of C, H, ° were also \\nformed from hydroxy derivatives. The first formed carbohydrate compound must have \\nbeen glucose and fructose. They condensed to form disaccharide and polysaccharide \\nlike sugars and starch. \\nIV. Formation of fatty acid and glycerol: The condensation and polymerization \\nof aldehyde and ketones and their oxidation resulted in the formation of fatty acids. \\nThese compounds had lesser percentage of oxygen and long straight chains of carbon. \\nIn the early oceans these glycerol and fatty acids might have combined to form fats. \\nV. Formation of NH2 acids: Combination of hydrocarbon, ammonia and water \\nunder the influence of freely available energy reacted to form amino compounds the \\namino acids. \\nThus after the synthesis of carbohydrate, fats and amino acids and other complex \\norganic substances probably occurred in sea, which according to Haldane is described \\nas \\'Hot dilute Soup\\'. The early ocean is considered to have been a primordial soup \\nthat contained all these building blocks of life. Life did not originate at one specific \\nspot at one specific time in the early oceans of earth life originated again and again \\nwherever necessary precursor accumulated. \\nSlep-2 Formation of macromolecular or complex organic molecules by polymerisation \\nand condensation \\nIn the hot dilute soup the molecules of simple organic substances came together22 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nin increasing number, collided, reacted and aggregated to form new molecules of \\nincreasing size and complexity resulting in the formati9n of more and more complex \\norganic compounds like polysaccharide, fats, proteins, purines, pyrimidines, nucleosides \\nand nucleotides. The process is called Polymerisation. Sugar molecules combined to form \\npolysaccharide like starch, cellulose and glycogen. The fatty acid and glycerol combine \\nto form fats. A large number of amino acid molecule combined to form long polypeptide \\nchains. Some of these polypeptide acted as primitive enzymes and speeded up the rate \\nof formation of specific molecules. \\nThe presence of appropriate organic monomers and polymers is the first step in \\nthe origin of life. The interaction between molecules due to hydrogen bonding, ionization \\nsolubility, surface tension etc. resulted in different orientation of molecules. Membranous \\nvesicles formed of lipids, polypeptides or other molecules can be produced by mechanical \\nagitation or spontaneously. These membranous vesicles represented an important step \\nin the origin of life because scientists were able to produce such simple structures in \\nthe laboratory viz. Coacervates and microspheres. \\n(a) Coacervates : Oparin and Fox found that large organic molecules synthesized \\nabiotically on primitive earth formed large colloidal aggregates due to intermolecular \\nattraction. These colloidal particles separate out of the solution into droplets called \\ncoacervates. Complex coacervates are made up of colloidal solution having more than \\none type of macromolecules. \\nWhen solutions of oppositely charged colloids are mixed coacervates droplets are \\nformed. They have much higher concentration of organic polymers than in aqueous \\nphase. \\nFig. 1 : Coacervate \\nThe Coacervates contain following characteristics \\n~ They are large enough to be seen under microscope. \\n~ They have very simple organisation. \\n~ They are mostly unstable, but some can stay for longer period. \\n~ They can increase in size by selectively absorbing proteins and other organic \\nmaterial.EVOLUTION OF MICROORGANISM 23 \\n-¢- They can divide by budding. \\n-¢- They can carry out functions like synthesis and hydrolysis of starch and \\npolynucleotides with the help of enzymes. \\nAlong with these characteristic the coacervate also present as poor model for \\nprotocells because : \\n-¢- They are formed from the mixture of contemporary bioproteins and not from \\nthe proteins that existed in past. \\n-¢- They are unstable and disintegrate with time. \\n(b) Microspheres : Fox found that when thermally produced protenoid were boiled \\nin water and allowed to cool, small spherical aggregates of protenoid are formed. These \\nare called microspheres. They have following characteristics: \\n-¢- They are easily formed when water is added to thermal proteinoids. \\n-¢- Show great uniformity in size and shape. \\n-¢- They resemble coccoid bacteria and generally form chains of varying length. \\n-¢- Generally stable. \\n-¢- E.M. of proteinoid microsphere reveal double layered boundary corresponding \\nto cell membranE\\' \\n-¢- They exhibit nonrandom motility. \\n-¢- They retain enzyme like activities of proteinoids. \\n-¢- They divide either by binary fission or by budding. \\nOn these basis it is assumed that microsphere like aggregates could have been the \\nfore runners of first living organism. Thus they provide an excellent model for protocells \\nbecause: \\n-¢- Microsphere originated from protenoid produced under conditions existing on \\nthe primitive earth. \\n-¢- They show structural and functional attributes of contemporary cells. \\nStep-3 : Formation of Nucleic Acids \\nThe next step was formation of nucleic acids by the polymerization of nucleotides. \\nThese self-replicating polynucIeotides (N. Acid) got established in the primordial earth \\nabout 3.5 billion yrs ago. Due to errors during replication different varieties of nucleic \\nacids were formed. These molecules with different nucleotides sequences competed for \\nthe available nucleotides precursor for self duplication. \\nCertain polynucleotides developed the quality of directing synthesis of polypeptides. \\nIt is suggested that RNA was the first carrier of genetic information. This shows that \\nthe genetic code and translation of nucleotide sequences into - NH2 acid sequences was \\nestablished at a very early stage of organic evolution. The nucleic acids were like naked \\ngenes and their formation was the first step to enter the vaguely defined frontiers \\nbetween life and non-life.24 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nStep-4 : Formation of Nucleoproteins or Protobionts : \\nDue to aggregation, giant molecules of nucleoproteins were formed by the union \\nof nucleic acid and basic protein molecules. \\nProtoribosomes : They were nucleoprotenoid particles with fiberous or globular \\nappearance. The globular nucleoprotenoid microparticles might have been early ribosomes \\nand called protoribosome. \\nProtoviruses : Some giant nucleoprotenoid molecules had certain characteristic of \\na free living gene. They were called protoviruses or protobionts by Oparin. \\nThe coacervate underwent some chemical reactions which produced special proteins \\nor enzymes. This led to self-replication of compounds, those possessing this property \\nmight be regarded as Freegene. Such a structure is comparable with the free living virus \\nand is supposed to be, formed of nucleoproteins. Self replication and mutations of a \\ngene lead to the formation of gene aggregates. These gene aggregates may be regarded \\nas independently existing chromosomes. The smallest bacteria represent such a stage \\nin its evolution. \\nFurther mutation lead to accumulation of metabolites around the chromosome. The \\ncomplex so formed represent the exposed nucleus. The cytoplasm might have been \\nacquired but not separated from the nuclear material as in blue green algae or in large \\nbacteria. Finally mutations led to the formation of typical cell with nuclear membrane. \\n(C) BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OR BIOGENY \\nThere are two hypothesis regarding the origin of primitive prokaryotic cell: \\n(a) Horowitz (1945) and Orgel (1973) proposed that nucleoprotein molecules formed \\naggregates in the hot soup of primitive sea. These got surrounded by nutrient shells \\nand limiting membrane and formed the first living cell. \\n(b) Oparin suggested that various macromolecules aggregated in the hot dilute soup \\nto form coacervates which got isolated from the surrounding by the formation of \\npolarized membrane of phospholipids. The coacervate with nucleoproteins developed \\ninto first living cells or protobionts. These first cells were similar to present day \\nmycoplasma and viruses. After some later stage in the evolutionary process. DNA took \\nthe place of a repository of genetic information. These protobionts most probably gave \\nrise to monera (cell without well defined nucleus) and Protista (cells with a distinct \\nnucleus). The monera and protista gave rise to Prokaryote and eukaryote respectively. \\nMonera developed into bacteria and cyanobacteria whereas Protista gave rise to \\neukaryote or that developed into Protozoa and Metaphyta. \\nThe fossilized remains of prokaryotic cells are around 3.5 to 3.8 billion years old \\nand have been discovered in stromatolites and sedimentary rocks and microbial fossil \\nare clearly present in rocks as old as 2 billion years. The stromatolites are layered or \\nstratified rocks often domed and are formed by incorporation of mineral sediments into \\nmicrobial mats. Thus prokaryotic cells or life arose very shortly after the earth cooled. \\nVery likely these early prokaryotes were anaerobic. The fossils of such primitive \\nprotobionts have been obtained from rocks in Africa about 3 billion yrs old. These wereEVOLUTION OF MICROORGANISM 25 \\nnamed Eobacterium isola tum. The modern stromatolites are layered or stratified rocks \\nformed by incorporation of calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate and Qther minerals into \\nmicrobial mats. \\nMicrospheres \\n~~ \\n4~; \\nGene like small nucleotide chains \\n(.1..1..1 \\n..... \\\\\\\\.~ \\n~~ \\n\\\\ \\nCoacervate \\ndrop \\n111,$ Nucleic acid molecules \\nn (Probably RNA) \\n~ ~ Virus Ike eobionlS \\nPrimitive \\nprokaryote \\n.. .. . \\n~ t·· --. ~ \\'. :\\':.

With rapid increase in the \\nnumber of chemoheterotroph, the nutrients from sea water began to disappear and \\ngradually exhausted. This lead to the evolution of other modes of nutrition like : \\n(a) Parasitism : This mode developed when some forms started living within the \\nbodies of living cells and obtained their food from them Example : Moneran, Viruses \\nand few protista are parasitic. \\n(b) Saprophytism : As the environment of primitive earth changed, some organism \\nstarted drawing their nourishment from the bodies of dead and decaying cell. \\n(c) Predation : The predators were the organism with animal like way of eating \\nwhere one organism eats another in whole or in part and obtains its food in this manner. \\n(d) Chemoautotrophs: Proto cells with enzymes of metabolic pathways could use \\nless complex nutrients and synthesized more complex molecules. They obtained energy \\nby fermentation. These early fermentative or anaerobic chemoautotrophs were similar \\nto our present day anaerobic bacteria and yeast. These anaerobic bacteria released large \\namount of CO z\\' Thus they were forerunners of photosynthetic cells. \\n(e) Chemosynthesisers : In the next step the evolution of chlorophyll molecule \\nenabled certain protocells to utilize light energy and synthetic carbohydrate. They were \\nphotosynthetic cells. The first photosynthetic cells were anaerobic, Example, the organism \\nsimilar to present day sulphur bacteria. This was the beginning of autotrophism where \\nthe HzS was cleaved into H2 and S where Hz was used in the synthesis of organic \\ncompound and sulphur released as waste product. These organism generate the energy \\nreleased by anaerobic respiration or fermentation and were called chemosynthesisers. \\n(f) Aerobic Photoautotroph : The last organism with most advanced type of \\nnutrition was Aerobic photoautotroph. It is presumed that accumulation of CO 2 in \\natmosphere and formation of chlorophyll molecule resulted in the evolution of autotrophic \\nforms. The first aerobic photoautotroph were cyanobacteria like forms which used water \\nas Hz source and CO 2 as the source of carbon in photosynthesis. They were called \\noxygen producing phototsynthesisers because of release of free oxygen in the atmosphere \\nand are also called oxygen producing photosynthesisers. They appeared about 3.3 - 3.5 \\nmillion yrs ago. \\nWith the increase of photoautotroph, 0z was liberated in the sea and then into \\natmosphere. This free oxygen then reacted with CH 4 and NH3 present in the primitive \\nearth and transformed them into CO z and free N 2• These gradual events ultimately \\ntransformed this ancient reducing, 0z free atmosphere into modern oxidizing atmosphere \\nwith plenty of oxygen. The rising level of atmosphere oxygen led to the appearance \\nof first one called eukaryotic organism. \\n(D) COGNOGENY \\nThe protocells were prokaryotic and archaebacteria like. The eukaryotic cells have \\nevolved from the archaic prokaryotic cell either by symbiosis or by invagination.EVOLUTION OF MICROORGANISM 27 \\nAccording to Lynn Margulis, some anaerobic predator host cell engulfed primitive \\naerobic bacteria but did not digest them. The oxygen respiring bacteria established \\nthemselves permanently inside host cells and developed mutual association. These \\npredator host cells become the first eukaryotic cells. The predators that captured aerobic \\nbacteria developed as mitochondria while with blue green algae as chloroplast. This \\nhypothesis is supposed as endosymbiont hypothesis. \\nMargulis and other have assembled a considerable amount of indirect evidence \\nin support of this hypothesis like Mitochondria and chloroplast are similar to bacteria \\nand cyanobacteria, they both contain self replicating DNA, ribosomes are similar like \\nprokaryotic cell. The proponents of endosymbiotic hypothesis suggest that endosymbionts \\nmust have transferred over time, some of their genes to the host nucleus and thus \\nrelinquished their independence for the sake of symbiotic relationship \\nAccording to other view the organelles of eukaryotic cells might have evolved by \\ninvagination of surface membrane of primitive prokaryotic celIs. The archaebacteria are \\nsaid to be the oldest of the \\'living fossils\\' that had separated from the main moneran \\nline (bacterial evolution) long ago. Regardless of the exact mechanism involved, the \\nemergence of eukaryotic cell led to dramatic increase in the complexity and diversity \\nof life on earth. At first organism were capable of existing only as independent single \\ncelIs. Later some evolved into multicellular organism in which various celIs became \\nspecialized for many different functions. The multiceIIular forms became adapted to life \\nin a great variety of environments. \\n000CLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM \\nA classification system based on the scheme of assigning individuals to group and \\nassigning these to progressively more inclusive and broader groups is called a hierarchial \\nscheme of classification. The formal system of organizing, classifying and naming living \\nthings is called taxonomy (Gr. Taxis = arrangement + nomas = name). The primary \\ngoals of taxonomy are classification, nomenclature and identification. These three areas \\nare interrelated and play a vital role in keeping a dynamic inventory of the extensive \\narray of living things. Once the characteristics of microorganism is determined and \\nappropriately catalogued the process of classification begins. The orderly arrangement \\nof organisms into group according to evolutionary relationship is termed as classification. \\nNomenclature is the process of assigning names to the various taxonomic ranking of \\neach microbial species. The process of discovering and recording the distinguishing \\nfeatures of organism is called identification. \\nTaxonomy has fascinated humans for a long time. The two Greek philosophers \\nHippocrates (460-377 B.C.) and Aristotle (384-322 B.c.) made the first recorded attempt \\nto classify all living things in the 384-322 B.C. the 4th century B.C., but their classification \\nwere not based on scientific methods. Later, after 2000 yrs in the eighteen century (1735), \\na Swedish biologist named Carolus Linnaeus devised a widely accepted scheme and \\nhe also laid down the basic rules for taxonomic categories or taxa and gave the bionomial \\nsystem of nomenclature i.e. naming of an organism by two names- genus and species. \\nThe name of the organism starts with the generic (Genus) name that is always capitalized, \\nwhich is followed by the species name that begins with small letter. Both names should \\nbe written in italics or underlined if italics are not available ex . Eschericia coli. The source \\nof nomenclature is usually latin or greek.Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1788) was a Swedish \\nnaturalist, called as \\'Father of Taxonomy\\' classified the organisms according to his own \\nsystem of classification (Binomial system). He wrote, \\'Systema Naturae\\', \\'GeneraCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 29 \\nPlantarum\\' and \\'Classes Plantarum\\' and Philosophia Botanica. According to him existing \\nspecies of plants and animals were the descendents of the previous created species. A \\nnumber of species have been named in honour of a scientist who originally discovered \\nthe microbe or who had made outstanding contribution to the field. For example E.coli, \\nthe generic name Escherichia is named after Theodor Escherich, a german bacteriologist \\nwho first described the bacterium, and specific name coli refers to the colon which is \\nappropriate because this organism is an enteric resident of humans. \\nThe Linnean scheme remains the basis for biological classification today which \\nprovides each organism with a unique name and Theophrastus (370-285 B.c.) a disciple \\nof Aristotle classified the plants on the basis of texture and is known as father of Botany. \\nHis book \\'Historia Plantarum\" deals with 480 plants. In the 1Th century two European \\nscientist John Ray (1627-1706) and Francis Willougby (1635-1672) collected many plants \\nand animals and classified them. John Ray described 18,000 plants and published a book \\n\\'Historia Generalis Plantarum\" in three volumes. \\nDomain Bacteria \\nI \\n\\'I \\nProteobacteria \\nI \\nPhylum \\nClass ot-Proteobacteria J3-Proteobacteria y-Proteobacteria II-Proteobacteria I:-Proteobacteria \\nI I I \\nOrder Chromatiales Thiotrichales Legionellales Pseudomonadales Vibrionales Enterobacteriales Pasteurellales \\nI \\nFamily \\nI \\nEnterobacteriaceae \\nI \\nGenus Enterobacter EscherichIa Klebsiella Proteus Salmonella Serratia Shigella Yersinia \\nI \\nI \\nI I I \\nSpecies S. boydii S. dysenteriae S. flexneri S. sonnei \\nFig. 1 : Hierarchical arrangement in taxonomy \\nHIERARCHICAL ARRANGEMENT IN TAXONOMY \\nThe basic taxonomic group in microbial taxonomy is the species whereas species \\nof higher organism are groups of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding natural \\npopulations that are reproductively isolated from other groups.

It is usually one of the \\nfirst strain studied and often more fully characterized than other strains. Each species \\nis assigned to a genus, the next rank in the taxonomic hierarchy. A genus is a well \\ndefined group of one or more species that is clearly separate from other genera or a \\ngenus. Category containing a single series or a monophyletic group of species, which \\nis separated from other genera by a decided gap. The next rank in the taxonomic \\nclassification is family which is a taxonomic category containing one or more related \\ngenera and separated from other related families by important and characteristic \\ndifferences. Next group of taxonomic classification is order which may include super \\norders or suborders. Class is the subdivision of a phyla. A class is the basic category \\nof the class group which may include super class or infra class. The next category of \\ntaxonomic classification is phylum which is divided into super phylum or sub phylum. \\nThe kingdom is the highest taxonomic category. All animals are included in animal \\nkingdom and all plants are included in the plant kingdom. \\nThus in brief the main taxa or groups in a classification scheme are organized in \\nseveral ascending ranks beginning with : \\nSpecies : It is a group of related isolates or strains. \\nGenus : It is a collection of related species. \\nFamily: A collection of similar genera. In prokaryotic nomenclature, the name of \\nthe family ends in the suffix-aceae. \\nOrder : A collection of similar families. In prokaryotic nomenclature the name of \\nthe family ends in the suffix-ales. \\nClass : It is a collection of similar orders. In prokaryotic nomenclature the name \\nof the family ends in the suffix-ia. \\nPhylum or Division : A collection of similar classes. \\nKingdom: A collection of similar phyla or division. The number of different \\nkingdom varies according to the classification system used. \\nDomain: A collection of similar kingdom. The domain is a relatively new taxonomic \\ncategory that reflects the characteristic of the cells that make up the organism. \\nAll individual members of a species must be very much alike. The highest \\ntaxon such as kingdoms, contain organisms that are quiet different from one \\nanother. \\nThe classification of microorganisms began in 1674 with the invention of light \\nmicroscope and today is a discipline based on increasingly complex criteria. The earliest \\nschemes assigned microorganisms to one or the other of the two major categories ofCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 31 \\nliving things plants and animals i.e two kingdom plantae and Animalia. In the nineteenth \\ncentury scientists began to realize that the assignments of certain members viz. Protozoa, \\nAlgae, Fungi and Bacteria into these two kingdom is very artificial for example: \\nmicroorganism are neither plants nor animals. Nearly every group has representatives \\nwith plant like properties and others with animal like properties. Thus the german \\nbiologist Ernst Haeckel in 1866 proposed a three kingdom concept-Plants, Animals and \\nmicroorganism (the Protista). He proposed that the bacteria, algae, fungi and protozoa \\nthat lacked tissue differentiation be removed from the plant and animal kingdoms and \\nbe separated into third kingdom called Protista. This scheme served biology well for \\nnearly 60 years. By the 1930\\'s there was reason to revise Haeckel\\'s classification scheme. \\nBy using the newly available election microscope, scientists discovered that there were \\ntwo types of cells-prokaryotic or eukaryotic. \\nBy the 1930s to 1959 several system of classification was proposed but the one \\nthat is most widely accepted was given by Robert H. Whittaker (1959), an American \\ntaxonomist of Cornell university. This system places all living things (except the viruses) \\ninto five kingdoms based on cellular organisation and nutritional patterns (i) the \\nprocaryotae or monera (ii) The protista (iii) The myceteae or fungi (iv) The plantae (v) \\nThe animalia (Table 1) \\nTABLE 1 \\nWhittaker Five Kingdom Concept \\nPro£e!!l: Plantae Animalia Protista Funs!

Animals \\nThe five kingdom system is not accepted by many biologist. A major problem is \\nits lack of distinction between archae and bacteria. The kingdom protista, Plantae and \\nfungi are ill defined. For example the brown algae are probably not closely related toCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 33 \\nplants even though the five kingdom system places them in the plantae. Because of \\nthese problems with five kingdom system, various alternative is the six kingdom system \\nwas the simplest option where the kingdom monera or prokaryote divided into two \\nkingdom viz. Eubacteria and Archaeobacteria. \\nCavalier Smith (1987, 1993) believes that differences in cellular structure and genetic \\norganization are exceptionally important in determining phylogeny. He used rRNA \\nsequences and other molecular data in developing his classification. He divided all \\norganism into two empires (Bacteria and Eukaryota). The empire bacteria contains two \\nkingdom the eubacteria and Archaeobacteria. The second empire the eukaryota contain \\nsix kingdom of eukaryotic organism viz. Archezoa, Protozoa, Plantae, Chromista, Fungi \\nand Animalia. The group Archezoa are primitive eukaryotic unicellular organism such \\nas Giardia with 70s ribosome and lack golgi apparatus, mitochondria, chloroplast and \\nperoxisomes. \\nThe kingdom chromista contain many photosynthetic organism that have their \\nchloroplast within the lumen of the rough E.R. rather than in the cytoplasmic matrix. \\nDiatom, brown algae, cryptomonads and oomycetes are all placed in the chrcmista. \\nHe acquire a completely new kind of information in the late ~960\\'s as scientists \\nbecame able to determine the sequences of monomers in macromolecules. This flow of \\nnew information has continued at an ever increasing rate. Sogin and his coworker do \\nnot cluster the eukaryotic into a few major divisions but consider them to be a single \\ndomain or empire composed of a collection of independently evolved lineages, By the \\n1970\\' s molecular biologists realized that prokaryotic consist of two different and \\nunrelated groups. They are as distantly related to each other as they are to eukaryotes. \\nTo accommodate this new information three microbiologists C. Woese, O. Kandler and \\nM.L. Wheelis introduced a new classification scheme in 1990. They proposed that all \\norganisms be divided into three major groups or super kingdoms called domains: the \\neukarya (containing all eukaryotes), the bacteria (containing most familiar prokaryotes), \\nand the Archaea (originally called archae bacteria and containing prokaryotes that live \\nmostly in extreme environments). \\nThe discovery of three cell types was based on the observations that ribosomes \\nare not the same in all cells. Ribosomes provide a method of comparing cells because \\nribosomes are present in all cells. Comparing the sequences of nucleotides in 16S rRNA \\nfrom different kinds of cells shows that there are three distinctly different cell groups: \\nthe eukaryotes and two different types of prokaryotes the bacteri~ and the archaea. \\nIn 1978 Carl R. Woese proposed elevating the three cell types to a level above \\nkingdom called domain. Woese believed that the archaea and the bacteria, although \\nsimilar in appearance, should form their own separate domains on the evolutionary tree. \\nIn this scheme, animals, plants, fungi and protests are the kingdoms in the domain \\neukarya. Organisms are classified by cell types in the three domain systems. \\nThe Domain Bacteria includes all of the pathogenic prokaryotes as well as many \\nof the nonpathogenic prokaryotes found in soil and water. The photoautotrophic \\nprokaryotes are also in this domain. The domain Archaea includes prokaryotes that do34 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nnot have peptidoglycan in their cell walls. They often live in extreme environments and \\ncarry out unusual metabolic processe~. Archaea include three major groups: \\n(i) The methanogens, strict anaerobes that produce methane (CH 4) from CO 2 and \\n~. \\n(ii) Extreme halophiles, which require high concentration of salt for survival. \\n(iii) Hyperthermophiles which normally grow in hot environment. \\nOriginally archae were thought to be the most primitive group, whereas bacteria \\nwere assumed to be more closely related to eukaryotes. However studies of rRNA \\nindicate that a universal ancestor split into three lineages. \\nIn sequencing the genome of a prokaryote called Thermotoga maritima microbiologist \\nKarene Nelson has discovered that this species has genes similar to members of both \\nthe domain bacteria and the domain Archaea. Her finding suggest that Thermotoga is \\none of the earliest cells arising before the bacteria and Archaea split apart. Thus \\nThermotoga is referred to as one of the /I deeply branching genera\" that is near the origin \\nor root of the evolutionary tree. Major differential features among bacteria, Archaea and \\nEukaryo are described in the Table (2). \\nTABLE 2 \\nMajor Differential Features Among Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya \\nCharacteristic \\nMorophological and Genetic \\nProkaryotic cell structure \\nDNA present in \\ncovalently closed \\nand circular form \\nBacteria \\nYes \\nYes \\nHistone protein present No \\nMembrane enclosed nucleus Absent \\nCell wall \\nMembrane lipids \\nRibosomes (mass) \\nInitiator (tRNA) \\nIntrons in most genes \\nOperons \\nCapping and poly A \\ntailing of mRNA \\nPlasmids \\nMuramic \\nacid present \\nEster linked \\n70S \\nFormymethionine \\nNo \\nYes \\nNo \\nYes \\nArchaea \\nYes \\nYes \\nYes \\nAbsent \\nMuramic acid \\nabsent \\nEther linked \\n70s \\nMethionine \\nNo \\nYes \\nNo \\nYes \\nEukarya \\nNo \\nNo \\nYes \\nPresent \\nMuramic \\nacid absent \\nEster linked \\n80s \\nMethionine \\nYes \\nNo \\nYes \\nRare \\nContd ...CLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 35 \\n...

In addition these characters are valuable because \\nstructural features depend on the expression of many genes, are usually genetically stable \\nand normally these do not vary greatly with environmental changes. Thus, morphological \\nsimilarity often is a good indication of phylogenetic relatedness. \\n2. Biochemical and Physiological characters : Many of the biochemical and \\nphysiological characters used to classify bacteria are based on conditions that support \\ngrowth. Do the bacteria grow aerobically, anaerobically or both? What incubation \\ntemperature is most favourable? Over what range of PH do they grow? Are they able \\nto withstand high osmotic strength? What end products and enzymes do they form? \\nCarbon sources that support growth are a particularly useful set of characters because \\nmost bacteria can use so many different carbon sources. In fact it\\'s possible to identify \\nmany species of bacteria just by the carbon sources they use. Modern technique make \\nthis a relatively easy task. A plastic plate with 96 depressions is prepared each containing \\na colourless form of a tetrazolium dye (an oxidation jreduction indicator that is colorless \\nwhen oxidized and colored when reduced) and a different carbon source. Then a \\nsuspension of bacterial cells is added. If the organism can use the carbon source, the \\ndye is reduced and becomes colored. The color pattern is read by a machine and results \\nare fed directly into a computer. In a few minutes the computer displays the name \\nof the bacterium. \\nCan trey use \\ncitric acid as their \\nsole carbon source? \\n~s \\nShigella: \\nProduces lysine \\ndecarboxylase \\nSalmonella : \\nGenerally \\nproduces H 2S \\nCan they \\nferment lactose ? \\nCan they use \\ncitric acid as their \\nsole carbon source? \\n~s \\nEscherichia Do they \\nproduce \\nacetion? \\nAs \\nCitrobacter Enterobacter \\nFig. 3 : Use of metabolic characteristics to identify selected genera of enteric bacteria \\nFermentation properties of bacteria are also useful characters. Thus biochemical \\ncharacters such as metabolic end products and the presence or absence of a particular \\nenzyme or pathway. \\n3. Cultural characters : These include the cultural requirements for multiplicationCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 39 \\n(e.g. nutrients, oxygen, temperature etc) and the way growth occurs in liquid media, \\nand particularly on solid media (e.g. colony form) \\n4. Serology : The other way to classify and identify bacteria is through serology \\n(the science that studies serum, the noncellular fraction of blood). Serum contains \\nantibodies (protein molecules made in response to infection). And these antibodies are \\nhighly specific, they target specific microbes. Thus antibodies can distinguish between \\nclosely related microorganisms and even between strains. Sera that inactivate particular \\nbacteria are called antisera. This antisera are used in a number of ways. For example, \\nthey can be used in slide agglulination test to identify particular species or strains. \\nFluorescent labelled antibodies prepared from antisera are also used in a similar but \\nmore sensitive procedure. \\n5. Phage typing: Bacteriophages, or phages (viruses that attack bacteria) can also \\nbe used to classify bacteria. The pattern of strains attacked by a set\\' of bacteriophages \\nis called phage typing. The diversity of bacterial strains that one bacteriophage will attack \\n(termed the host range) is quiet narrow. Only closely related bacterial strains are attacked \\nby the same phages, phage typing is usually restricted to classifying strains within \\nspecies. \\nIn phage typing, a thin layer of the bacterial strain to be tested is spread on the \\nsurface of an agar plate and small drops of suspensions of various phages are placed \\non the surface. If the bacteria are susceptible to the phages in one or more of the drops \\nthey will lyse, producing a clear zone in the lawn (confluent layer of bacterial growth) \\nthat forms. \\nStrains with identifical phage types are identical. Strains with similar phage types \\nare closely related. Because phage typing can identify specific strains of bacteria, it is \\nused to determine if a cluster of bacterial infection is caused by the same strain. \\n6. Fatty acid analysis (FAME) : Bacteria differ in the type and reative quantity \\nof fatty acids that makeup their membranes, thus the cellular fatty acids composition \\ncan be used as an identifying marker. In gram -ve bacteria the fatty acids are present \\nin both, the cytophlasmic and the outer membranes. Whereas in gram +ve bacteria \\n(lacking an outer membrane), the cytoplasmic membrane is the source of fatty acids. \\nTo analyse their fatty acid composition, bacterial cells are grown under standardised \\nconditions. After this the cells are chemically treated with sodium hydroxide and \\nmethanol to release the fatty acids and to convert those acids to their more volatile \\nmethy ester form (FAME = Fatty acid methyl ester). \\nThe resulting fatty acids, methylated esters can than be separated and analysed \\nusing gas chromatography. By comparing the pattern of peaks, or chromatogram, to \\nthose of known species and isolate can be identified. \\nGENOME COMPARISON \\nIn the 1960s taxonomists began to develop methods to examine greater portions \\nof the genome. Some of the most powerful approaches to taxonomy are through the \\nstudy of proteins and nucleic acids because these are either direct gene products or40 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nthe genes themselves. Comparisons of proteins and nucleic acids yield considerable \\ninformation about true relatedness. These molecular approaches have become increasingly, \\nimportant in prokaryotic taxonomy. \\nComparison of Protein \\nAmino acid sequences of proteins are direct reflections of mRNA sequences and \\ntherefore closely related to the structures of the genes coding for their synthesis. \\nComparisons of proteins of different microorganisms are very useful taxonomically. If \\nthe sequences of proteins with the same function are similar, the organisms possessing \\nthem are probably closely related. The sequences of cytochromes and other electron \\ntransport proteins, his tones, heat shock proteins, transcription and translation proteins \\nand a variety of metabolic enzymes have been used in taxonomic studies. The \\nelectrophoretic mobility of proteins is useful in studying relationships at the species and \\nsubspecies level. \\nThe physical kinetic and regulatory properties of enzymes have been employed \\nin taxonomic studies. Because enzyme behavior reflects NH2 acid sequences, which is \\nuseful in studying some microbial group and group specific patterns of regulation have \\nbeen found. \\nNucleic Acid Base Composition \\nThis technique proved useful for microbes. There genomes can be directly compared \\nand taxonomic similarity can be estimated in many ways. It is possibly the most simplest \\ntechnique to be used in the determination of DNA base composition. However, it can \\nbe determined chemically by hydrolyzing DNA sample and separating the free bases \\nwith HPLC, it can be determined more easily by physical methods which is most \\nfrequently used. DNA contains four purine and pyrimidine bases-Adenine (A), Guanine \\n(G), Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T). In double stranded DNA, A pairs with T and \\nG pairs with C. Thus (G + C) / (A + T) ratio or G + C content is the percent of \\nG + C in DNA, reflects the base sequence and varies with sequence changes as \\nfollows:-\\nG+C Mol % G + C = x 100 G+C+A+T \\nThe G + C content often is determined from the melting temperature (fm) of DNA. \\nIn DNA structure 3 hydrogen bonds join GC base pairs and two bonds connect AT \\nbase pairs. As a result the DNA with greater G + C content will have more hydrogen \\nbonds and its strands will separate only at higher temperatures that is it will have a \\nhigher melting point. DNA melting can be easily followed spectro photometrically \\nbecause the absorbance of 260 nm UV light by DNA increases during strand separation. \\nWhen a DNA sample is slowly heated, the absorbance increases as hydrogen bonds \\nare broken and reaches a plateau when all the DNA has become single stranded. The \\nmelting point of the rising curve gives the melting temperature, a direct measure of \\nthe G + C content. Since the density of DNA also increases linearly with G + C content, \\nthe percent G + C can be obtained by centrifuging DNA in a Caesium chloride densityCLASSIFICA nON OF MICROORGANISM 41 \\ngradient. This method can be used because the density of DNA is also a function of \\n(G + C): (A + T) ratio. \\nThe G + C content of the nuclear DNA of major groups of organism has been \\nstudied. In both plants and animals the ranges are relatively narrow and quiet similar, \\naverges around 40% and ranges between 30 -50%. However in prokaryotic microorganism \\nthe G + C content is highly variable ranging from around 25 to almost 80%. For example, \\nvarious Streptococci, Pneumococci and Lactobacilli have a similar value (38-40%) which \\nhave been traditionally grouped together as lactic acid bacteria (because of their \\ncharacteristic fermentation). The G + C content of strains within a particular species \\nis constant. If two organisms differ in their G + C content by more than about 10%, \\ntheir genomes have quite different base sequences. \\nTaxonomically these G + C data are valuable for at least two reasons: \\n-¢- They can confirm a taxonomic scheme developed using other data. If organisms \\nin the same taxon are too dissimilar, in G + C content the taxon probably should \\nbe divided. \\n-¢- The G + C content appears to be useful in characterizing prokaryotic genera \\nsince the variation within a genus is usually less than 10% even though the \\ncontent may vary greatly between genera. For example Staphylococcus has a \\nG + C content of 30 - 38% whereas MicroccocllS DNA has 64 to 75% G + C, \\nyet these two genera of gram positive cocci have many other features in \\ncommon. \\nNucleic Acid Hybridization \\nThe similarity between genomes can be compared more directly by use of nucleic \\nacid hybridization studies. This includes DNA-DNA homology or DNA base sequence \\nand RNA sequences. If a mixture of single stranded DNA (formed by heating of ds \\nDNA) is cooled and held at a temperature about 25°C below the Tm, strands with \\ncomplementary base sequences will reassociate to form stable dsDNA, and the non \\ncomplementary strands will remain single. Incubation at 10-15°C below the Tm permits \\nhybrid formation day with almost identical strands. \\nThe most widely used hybridization techniques include nitro-cellulose filters which \\nbounds nonradioactive DNA strands are incubated at the appropriate temperature with \\nsingle stranded DNA fragments made radioactive with 32P, 3H or 14C. After radioactive \\nfragments are allowed to hybridize with the membrane bounds single stranded DNA, \\nthe membrane is washed to remove any non hybridized single stranded DNA and its \\nradioactivity is measured. The quantity of radioactivity bound to the filter reflects the \\namount of hybridization and thus the similarity of the DNA sequences. The degree of \\nhomology is expressed as the percent of experimental DNA radioactivity retained on \\nthe filter compared with the percent of homologue DNA radioactivity bound under the \\nsame conditions. Two strains whose DNA\\'s show at least 70% relatedness under optimal \\nhybridization conditions and less than a 5% difference in Tm is often considered as \\nmembers of the same species. However DNA preparation from two unrelated bacteria, \\ncould not hybridise or they will not form a stable detectable hybrid. Therefore DNA-42 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nDNA hybridization is used to study only closely related microorganism and the more \\ndistantly related organisms are compared by carrying out DNA- RNA hybridization \\nexperiments or by forming duplex between single stranded DNA and complementary \\nRNA strands. It includes the experiments carrying out using radioactive ribosomal or \\ntRNA. Distant relationships can be detected because rRNA and tRNA genes represent \\nonly a small portion of the total DNA genome and have not evolved as rapidly as most \\nother microbial genes. The RNA molecules are highly conserved in an evolutionary \\nsense and provide a very useful measure of the phylogenetic relationships of the \\nwider groupings of microorganisms. The choosen molecules are 16 5rRNA and \\n55rRNA. Although this technique of nucleic acid hybridization have not yet \\nprovided a phylogenetic bacterial taxonomy to replace the classical Bergey\\'s determinative \\nkey. \\n1.5 \\nE 1.4 t: \\ng \\nC\\\\I \\n«i B 1.3 \\nt: \\n.e E 1.2 \\nell \\nQ) \\n.<!! \\n«i \\n(j) 1.1 a: \\n,i\"C. \\n\"ll\" II \\nFig. 4 : A DNA melting curve \\nNUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCING \\nThe sequence of bases in DNA determines an organism\\'s genetic plan. Thus on \\nidentical sequence means identical organisms and a similar sequence means closely related \\norganisms, comparing DNA base sequences is the ultimate tool of taxonomy. The \\nsubstantial length of DNA sequence can be measured by Maxam and Gilbert method \\nor measured sequenced by 5angers. By the advancement of technology it is now possible \\nby sequencing both DNA and RNA. By far RNA sequencing has been used more \\nextensively in microbial taxonomy and the most attention is given to sequences of 55 \\nand 165rRNA\\'s isolated from 50 5 and 305 subunits respectively of prokaryotic ribosomes. \\nThe rRNA are almost ideal for studies of microbial evolution and relatedness since itCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 43 \\nis essential to a critical organelle found in all microorganisms. Their functional role is \\nsame in all ribosomes. Furthermore their structure changes very slowly with time. \\nBecause the structure of ribosome cannot tolerate much change and still remain \\nfunctional, rRNA is highly conserved. Thus the rRNA of even distantly related organisms \\nis similar enough that we can not count their number of differences and thus calculate \\nthe evolutionary distance between them. The sequencing of SSrRNA from different \\norganisms to determine relatedness between organisms is based on the assumption that \\nthe molecule in all organisms have a common origin: they were originally identical as \\none species evolves into another the DNA sequences encoding rRNA change but the \\nrRNA continues to serve the same function. The similarity of DNA sequences encoding \\na molecule such as 5SU rRNA is therefore a direct measure of the relatedness of the \\norganisms that produced those molecule. Conversely the number of differences in their \\nDNA sequences is a measure of evolutionary distance between a pair of organisms. \\nOrganism A DNA \\n11\"\"\\'11 \\n,.... i I~ \\n(4) Determine degree \\nof hybridisation \\n:1111111\" \\nComplete hybridisation \\n(Identical) \\nOrganism B DNA \\n:1 I , , , I , I] \\n, \\'--c.. \\n(2) Combine single strands of DNA \\n(3) Cool to allow renaturation of ds DNA \\n::I ~ 1\"\\'\"\" Iii , i \\\\-\"\\' \\n_\"\\'~ \\nPartial hybridisation ~N b \\'d\\' .

The studies on the sequences of bases \\nin rRNA first revealed that the archaea are a separate major biological group. \\nA complete rRNA can be sequenced using several different procedures. In one \\napproach, RNA is first isolated, purified. Then reverse transcriptase is used to make \\ncomplementary DNA (cDNA) using primers that are complementary to conserved rRNA \\nsequences. Next the PCR amplifies the cDNA. Finally the cDNA is sequenced and the \\nrRNA sequence deduced from the results. Nowadays is used to amplify the 165 rRNA44 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nfrom the bacterial genome. The amplified rRNA then sequenced either manually or by \\nan auto mated sequence using the Sanger method. \\nThe relatedness of organisms can be determined by comparing the sequences of \\nbases in genes that encodes proteins. It is possible because every organism has a few \\nproteins that serve the same function in all organisms. Sequencing the genes that encode \\nthese proteins gives information much like that gained from sequencing SSurRNA. \\nRNA FINGER PRINTING AND SEQUENCING \\nA number of tRNA and 5SrRNA have been sequenced but because they are small \\nmolecules the amount of information they contain is fairly low. More useful for \\ntaxonomic purposes are sequences of larger molecules such as 16S or 18S rRNA. Carl \\nWoese was the first who initiated studies on the phylogeny of 16SRNA. He digested \\n16SRNA with a specific endonuclease producing a variety of short oligonucleotide which \\nwere separated and sequenced. It was the finding that the 16SrRNA sequences of \\nmethanogens halophiles and thermoacidophiles were unexpectedly divergent from those \\nof other bacteria that allowed the recognition of archaebacteria as a distinctive \\nassemblage of bacteria. \\nThe methods deviced by Woese is as follows: radioactive 16S rRNA (obtained by \\ngrowing organisms in the presence of phosphate containing the radioactive isotope 32p) \\nis purified and digested with the endonuclease T l\\' This endonuclease cleaves the RNA \\non the 3\\' side of every guanosine residue hence a mixfure of oligonucleotides is obtained \\nthat range in size from a single nucleotide to a dozen or more, all containing a single \\nguanosine residue at the 3\\' terminus. These are now separated by two dimensional \\nelectrophoresis (the mixture is electrophoresed in one dimension in one buffer system, \\nthen in a second dimension in another buffer system) and their position determined \\nby autoradiography. The labelled oligonucleotides can then be removed and sequenced. \\nPractically only those with a chain length of five residues or more contain sufficient \\ntaxonomic information to be worth cataloguing. Oligonucleotide catalogues of a number \\nof organism are analysed with the help computer program, which compares them in \\na pairwise fashion and result can be displayed as a dendrogram. \\nA detailed analysis of 16SrRNA oligonucleotide catalogues or complete sequences \\nreveals that there are both, quiet variable and highly conserved regions of the molecule, \\nreflecting different degrees of functional constraint on different parts of the molecule. \\nSeparate comparison of the variable and conserved regions allows determination of both \\nclose and distant relationship. In conserved regions there are sequences of that are \\ncharacteristic of major groups of bacteria, termed signature sequences. At great \\nphylogenetic distances these signature sequences are important in allowing the \\ndetermination of relationships. . \\nThe rapid technique to sequence long molecules of RNA has been devised and \\nnow used in preference to finger printing. To sequence a long molecule of rRNA, bulk \\nRNA is isolated from a culture (no need to purify) and a short RNA primer is added \\nthat is homologous to one of the conserved regions of rRNA. Dideoxy sequencing canCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 45 \\nthen be performed directly on the RNA template using the enzyme reverse transcriptase \\na viral enzyme that produces a DNA compliment to a RNA molecule. \\nIn prokaryotic ribosomes there are three different ribosomal RNAs i.e. 5S, 16S and \\n23S but only 16S sequence is used because nucleotides are neither less nor more in \\nlength and easy to sequence 1,500 nucleotides are present in 16SrRNA, the 5SrRNA \\ncontain only - 120 nucleotides that are too small to conclude any fruitful relationship, \\nwhereas 23S contains approximately - 2,900 nucleotides which are quiet high in number. \\nDNA SEQUENCING \\nEither of the two different procedures can be used to sequences substantial lengths \\nof DNA i.e. The Sanger method or the Maxam and Gilbert method. Although they differ \\nin chemical detail, both rest on the same basic principle; a series of DNA fragments \\nare generated which have a common starting point, but variable termini (\"nested\" \\nfragments); by determining their exact length and the terminal base, the sequence can \\nbe inferred with great accuracy. Sanger method can be explain with an example. \\nIn order to determine the sequence of bases in a segment of DNA, a large number \\nof identical copies of it must be obtained. If the molecule that contains the sequence \\nis relatively small (e.g. a viral genome or a plasmid), one can feasibly sequence the \\nentire molecule. In such a case one need only separate the molecule from contaminating \\nnucleic a~id (e.g. fragments of the bacterial chromosome). If the sequence is part of a \\nmuch larger molecule, such as the bacterial chromosome, the usual approach is to clone \\nthe desired segment, and sequence a restriction fragment purified from the cloned DNA. \\nSince the Sanger method uses single-stranded DNA, the segment must either be digested \\nwith a nuclease to convert it to single-stranded DNA or, preferably, cloned in a single\\xad\\nstranded vector to begin with (bacteriophage M13). \\nSequencing of a purified single-stranded fragment is accomplished by generating \\na series of complementary nested fragments of DNA by incubating the fragment with \\nDNA polymerase, a short primer sequence complementary to a region of the fragment \\n(often a short restriction fragment itself), the four deoxy nucleoside triphosphates (one \\nor more of which are radioactive), and a small amount of one dideoxy nucleoside \\ntriphosphate (e.g. dideoxythymidine triphosphate). Chance incorporation of \\ndideoxythymidine, which lacks a 3\\' -hydroxyl group, terminates polymerization at that \\npoint. Thus, after a suitable incubation period, the mixture will contain radioactive DNA \\nstrands of variable length, all of which terminate in a thymidine residue. The number \\nof classes of DNA molecules, differing from each other in length, depends on the number \\nof thymidine residues, since for every thymidine residue in the new strand, there will \\nbe a family of radioactive DNA molecules that terminates at that point. \\nIn practice four parallel incubations are performed, identical except that each \\ncontains a different dideoxy nucleoside triphosphate, and hence will terminate at a \\ndifferent base. The mixture is then denatured and electrophoresed to separate the newly \\nsynthesized strands by size. The position of the radioactive bands on the gel are \\nvisualized by appressing the gel tightly to a sheet of X-ray film, which is exposed by \\nthe localized decay of the radioisotope incorporated into the DNA. Upon development,46 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nthe film displays a series of exposed bands, each of which corresponds to a size class \\nof single-stranded DNA. The sequence can then be inferred directly from this \\nautoradiogram; the shortest fragment will be found in the incubation mixture that \\ncontains the dideoxy analogue of the first base after the primer; the next shortest \\nfragment will be found in the mixture that contains the dideoxy analogue of the second \\nbase after the primer, and so on for up to hundreds of bases. \\nDNA sequencing techniques were devised by molecular biologists and have been \\napplied primarily to genetic problems with dramatic success, but to date the application \\nof these techniques to taxonomic problems has been minimal. However, as the techniques \\nare more widely applied, and a rapidly expanding library of sequences begins to include \\na number of homologous sequences from different organisms, taxonomists will \\nundoubtedly come to depend increasingly on comparison of DNA base sequence to \\ndetermine organismic relationships. Indeed it is probably not unrealistic to anticipate \\nthat in the near future the complete base sequence for the genomes of a number of \\nmicroorganisms will be available, and microbial taxonomy may become an exact, \\nquantitative science. \\nMicrobial Phylogeny \\nAnalysis of oligonucleotide catalogues of 165 rRNA has allowed the recognition \\nthat the bacteria can be divided into several major groups based on the similarity of \\ntheir ribosomal RNA. The degree of sequence similarity of this molecule is a reflection \\nof the phylogenetic distance among organism. The rate of change of the sequence of \\ngenes encoding it is much less than that of the bulk of the genome, and it is possible \\nto determine relationship over vast evolutionary distances. The comparison of complete \\nsequences of eubacterial and archaebacterial 165 and eukaryotic 185rRNA shows that \\neven at the greatest phylogenetic distances among cellular organisms about 50% \\nhomology remains. This rRNA functions as a molecular clock, and allows accurate \\ndetermination of phylogenetic distance. Following are some ways in which phylogenetic \\nrelationship are assessed. \\nMolecular Chronometers \\nThe sequence of nucleic acids and proteins change with time and are considered \\nto be molecular chronometers. This term was first suggested by Zucketkandl and Pauling \\n(1965), is important in the use of molecular sequences in determining phylogenetic \\nrelationship. It is assumed that there is an evolutionary clock where the sequences of \\nmany rRNA and protein gradually change over time without destroying or severely \\naltering their functions. In molecular chronometers it is assumed that such changes occur \\nfairly randomly, selectively neutral and increase linearly with time. When the sequence \\nof similar molecules are quiet different in two groups of organisms, the group diverged \\nfrom one another a long time ago. Using molecular chronometer for phylogenetic analysis \\nis complex because the rate of sequence change can vary because some period are \\nrecognized by especially rapid change. Along with this different molecules and various \\nparts of the same molecule can change at different rates. Highly conserved molecules \\nlike rRNA are used to follow large scale evolutionary changes while rapidly changing \\nmolecules are employed for speciation. Many scientist believes that these molecularCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 47 \\nchronometers especially protein clocks are not accurate and further studies are required \\nto establish their accuracy and usefulness. \\nGene \\n(a) \\n\\'\\\\ \\nVector \\n(b) \\n\\'\" \\nPrimer \\n(c) - ACGAATACGATCCATGCG \\n--T \\n\\'\\\\ \\nPrimer \\n(d) Mix 1: dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, ddATP \\n---TGCTTddA \\n-----TGCTT ATGCTddA \\n---TGCTTATGCTAGGTddA \\netc. \\nMix 2: dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, ddGTP \\n--TGddG \\n--TGCTTATGddG \\n----TGCTTATGCTAddC \\n-TGCTTATGCTAGGTACGddC \\netc. \\nMix 3: dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, ddGTP \\n--TddG \\n---TGCTTATddG \\n---TGCTTATGCTAddG \\n-----TGCTT ATGCTAGddG \\n--TGCTTATGCTAGGTACddG \\netc. \\nMix 4: dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, ddTTP \\n-----TGCddT \\n---TGCTdd'),\n",

Each node \\nrepresent taxonomic units like species or genes. The external node those at the end of \\nthe branches represent living organism. The length of branches may represent the number \\nof molecular changes that takes place between the two nodes. Finally a tree can be rooted \\nor uprooted. The rooted tree gives a node that serves as the common ancestor and shows \\ndevelopment of the species from the root. It is a difficult task to develop a rooted tree. \\nIn contrast an unrooted tree simply represent a phylogenetic relationships but does not \\nprovide an evolutionary path. \\nThe Phylogenetic trees are developed by comparing molecular sequences. The first \\nstep to compare two molecules is to align there sequences so that similar parts match \\nup. The object is to align and compllre homologous sequences (once that are similar \\nbecause they had a common origin in the part). The computer plus complex mathematics \\nis employed to minimize the number of gaps and mismatches in the sequence is \\ncompared. \\nOnce the molecule is aligned the number of position that vary in the sequence \\ncan be determined and this data is used to calculate a measure of the differences between \\nthe sequences. The difference is expressed as the evolutionary distance. The evolutionary \\ndistance is a quantitative indication of the number of positions that differ between two \\naligned macromolecules. Statistical calculation is then made for back mutation and \\nmultiple substitution. In the next step the organism are then clustered together on the \\nbasis of similarity in the sequences. The most similar organism are then clustered together \\nand compared with the remaining organUim to form large duster associated together \\nat a lower level of similarity or evolutionary distance. This process is continued till all \\norganism are included in the tree. The another technique to estimate phylogenetic tree \\nis by parsimony analysis. Here the relationship are determined by estimating the \\nminimum number of sequence changes required to give the final sequences being \\ncompared. It is assumed that evolutionary changes occur along the shortest pathway \\nwith the fewest changes or steps from an ancestor to the organism in question. \\nrRNA, DNA AND PROTEIN AS INDICATORS OF PHYLOGENY \\nThe comparison of 165RNA isolated from various strains of prokaryote is of great \\nimportance in determining the phylogenetic relatedness then any other molecular \\ntechnique. The association coefficient or 5ab Value from rRNA studies is assumed to \\nbe a true measure of relatedness, the higher the 5ab value obtained from comparing \\ntwo organism, the more closely the organism are related to each other. If the sequence \\nof 165 rRNA of two organism are identical (5ab Value = 01). A group of prokaryote \\nthat branches off from other prokaryote long ago show a large range of 5ab value because \\nit has had more time to diversify than a group that developed more recently. Therefore \\nthe narrower the range of Sab value of a group of prokaryote the more modern it is. \\nAfter the determination of 5ab value the computer calculates the relatedness of the \\norganism and summarize its relationship in a tree or dendrogram. \\nThe 165rRNA of most major phylogenetic groups has one or more character sitesCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 49 \\nnucleotide sequence called oligonucleotide signature or oligonucleotide signature \\nsequences. These sequences are specific sequences which occur in most of all members \\nof a particular phylogenetic groups. They are rarely or never present in other groups \\neven of the closely related onces. Thus these sequences can be used to place the \\nmicroorganism in the proper group. These sequences has been identified for various \\norganism viz. bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and many other prokaryotic groups. \\nAlthough rRNA comparison are useful for the species level but DNA similarity \\nstudies are more effective in categorizing individual species and genera. These comparison \\ncan be carried out by using G + C content or hybridization studies. Like rRNA the \\nDNA composition of a cell does not change with growth conditions. The DNA \\ncompal'ison are based on complete genome rather than a fraction and precisely define \\na species based on 70% relatedness criteria. \\nCurrently many protein sequences are used to develop phylogenetic trees. This \\napproach has some advantages over rRNA comparisons. The sequence of 20 amino acids \\nhas more information persite than a sequences of four nucleotides. The protein sequences \\nare less affected by organism specific differences in G + C content than DNA and RNA \\nsequences and finally the protein sequence alignment is easier because it is not dependent \\non secondary structure as in an rRNA sequence. This approach involve some disadvantages \\nlike; indispensable protein with constant function do not change as rapidly whereas some \\nprotein like Ig evolve quiet rapidly. Thus all proteins are not suitable for studying large \\nscale change that occur over long periods. \\nSummary it is clear that sequences of all three macromolecules viz, rRNA, DNA \\nand proteins can provide valuable phylogenetic information but more molecular data \\nplus further study of phenotypic properties will help to resolve uncertainities. \\nNumerical Taxonomy: The earliest system of biological classification were based \\non arbitrarily chosen criteria and this classification was termed as artificial classification. \\nThe first such system of classification which was widely accepted was that given by \\nLinnaeus. Later when the fact of biological evolution was recognized another dimension \\nwas immediately added to the concept of natural or phentic classification. In the 19th \\ncentury the classification was based on the terms of evolutionary affinities and the \\ntaxonomic hierarchy in a certain sense become the reflection of a family tree and such \\na taxonomic system is called as phylogenetic system. \\nAn alternative approach for the classification is empirical one where the taxonomic \\narrangement is based on quantification of the similarities and differences among \\norganism. This was first suggested by a French biologist Michal Adansona and the \\nclassification is also named as Adansonian (or numerical) taxonomy. Here each \\nphenotypic character is given equal weighting, it should express numerically the \\ntaxonomic distances between organisms in terms of the number of characters they share, \\nrelative to the total number of characters examined. \\nThe process begins with a determination of the presence or absence of selected \\ncharacters in the group of organisms under study. Many characters at least 50 and \\npreferably several hundred should be compared for an accurate and reliable classification. \\nIt nlcludes many different kinds of data viz. morphological, biochemical and physiological.50 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nAfter character analysis, an association coefficient a function that measures the \\nagreement between characters possessed by two organism is calculated for each pair \\nof organisms in the group. The simple matching coefficient (Ssm) is the proportion of \\nthe characters that match regardless of the whether the attribute is present or absent. \\nSometimes the Jaccord coefficient (Sj) is calculated by ignoring any characters that \\nboth organism lack. Both coefficients increase linearly in value from 0.0 (no matches) \\nto 1.0 (100% matches). \\nSimple matching coefficient or other association coefficients are then arranged to \\nform a similarity matrix. This is a matrix in which the rows and columns represent \\norganisms and each value is an association coefficient measuring the similarity of two \\ndifferent organisms so that each organism is compared to every other one in the table. \\nOrganisms with great similarity are grouped together and separated from dissimilar \\norganisms. Such groups of organisms are called phenons (or phenoms). \\nthe results of numerical taxonomic analysis are often summarized with a tree like \\ndiagram called dendrogram. the x-axis or abscissa generated in units of similarity. Each \\nbranch point is at the similarity value relating the two branches. The organisms in the \\ntwo branches share so many characteristics that the two groups are seen to be separate \\nonly after examinations of association coefficient greater than the magnitude of the branch \\npoint value. Below the branch point the two groups appear to be one. A 70-phenon is \\na phenon with 70% or greater similarity among its constituents. Phenons formed at about \\n80% similarity often are equivalent to species. Numerical taxonomic methods also can \\nbe used to compare sequences of macromolecules such as RNA and proteins. \\nTABLE 4 \\nTaxonomic Criteria Used for Classification \\nand Identification of Bacteria \\nCriterion \\nMorphological characteristics \\nDifferential staining \\nBiochemical testing \\nSerology \\nPhage typing \\nAmino acid sequencing \\nProtein analysis \\nBase composition of nucleic acids \\nNucleic acid hybridization \\nFlow cytometry \\nNumerical taxonomy \\nYes \\nUsed for \\nClassification \\nNo (yes for \\ncyanobacteria) \\n(for cell wall type) \\nNo \\nYes \\nNo \\nYes \\nYes \\nYes \\nYes \\nNo \\nYes \\nIdentification \\nYes \\nYes \\nYes \\nYes \\nYes \\nNo \\nNo \\nNo \\nYes (DNA probes) \\nYes \\nNoCLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM 51 \\nPolyphasic Taxonomy \\nAs we come to know by previous paragraph that all phylogenetic results vary with \\ndata used in analysis, many taxonomist believe that all possible valid data should be \\nemployed in determining phylogeny, in the approach called polyphasic taxonomy, \\ntaxonomic schemes are developed using a wide range of phenotypic and genotypic \\ninformation ranging from molecular properties to ecological characteristics. The criteria \\nfor the selection of techniques depend upon the level of taxonomic resolution needed. \\nLike serological technique is used to identify strains, but not for genera or species. Protein \\nelectrophoretic pattern is useful in determining species but not for genera or families. \\nDNA hybridization and percentage G + C content can be used to study species and \\ngenera other characteristic like chemical composition, DNA probe result, rRNA sequences, \\nDNA sequences can be used to define species, genera and families. \\n000NOMENCLATVRE AND BERGEY'S MANUAL \\nBacterial systematics has undergone several changes and is continuously in a state \\nof flux as our knowledge of microorganism is far from complete and new information \\nis being added every day. In 1923 David Bergey, professor of bacteriology at the \\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and four colleagues published a classification of bacteria that \\ncould be used for identification of bacterial species. The Bergey's manual of determinative \\nbacteriology has been a widely used reference since publication of the first edition in \\n1923. This manual is now in its ninth edition edited in 1992. The manual does not classify \\nbacteria according to evolutionary relatedness but provides identification (determining) \\nschemes, based on such criteria as cell wall composition, morphology, differential \\nstaining, oxygen requirement and biochemical testing. In this volume bacteria are \\nassigned 19 parts based primarily on following fedtures like energy and carbon source, \\nmode of locomotion, morphology and gram stain reaction, gaseous requirement and \\nendospore formation ability. The edition was published by Wilkins and Baltimore \\ncompany of USA. \\nFrom 1984, the Bergey's Manual was renamed Bergey's Manual of systematic \\nBacteriology is being published in sepnate volumes. This manual includes 35 sections \\nbased on characters like general shape, morphology, gram staining, presence of \\nendospore, motility, oxygen relationships, mode of energy production. The manual \\ninclude four divisions of the kingdom Prokaryotae. The Gracilicutes (gram -ve cell wall) \\nFirmicutes (gram + ve cell wall other than actinomycetes), Tenericutes (bacteria lacking \\ncell wall uther than actinomycetes) and Mendoricutes (bacteria lacking peptidoglycan \\nin their cell wall like Archaebacteria).NOMENCLATURE AND BERGEY'S MANUAL 53 \\nGracilicutes (thin skin) \\n[Cell wall characteristics of gram-vel \\nClass \\nScotobacteria \\nEx.

As a consequence, the second \\nedition of Bergey's manual is largely phylogenetic rather than phonetic and thus quiet \\ndifferent from the first edition and second edition is published in five volumes. It has \\nmore ecological information about individual taxa. The second edition does not group \\nall the clinically important prokaryotes together as the first edition, instead, pathogenic \\nsps will be placed phylogenetically and thus scattered throughout the following five \\nvolumes. \\nVol. 1 \\nVol. 2 \\nVol. 3 ,. \\nVol. 4 \\nVol. 5 A' \\nThe Archaea, and the deeply branching and phototrophic bacteria. \\nThe Proteobacteria \\nThe low G + C gram + ve bacteria \\nThe high G + C gram + ve bacteria \\nThe Planctomycetes, Spirochaetes, Fibrobacteres, Bacteroidetes and \\nFusobacteria.54 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nTABLE 1 \\nOrganization of Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology \\nTaxonomic Rank \\nVolume 1.

The inclusion of these groups in volume five does not simply that they \\nare directly related. All of them are gram -ve bacteria variable in morphology, physiology \\nand life cyt:le pattern. The four important phyla are briefly described: \\n1. Phylum : Planctomycetes (related to chlamydias according to rRNA sequences \\nit contain only one order (are coccoid to avoid or pear shaped that lack peptidoglycan, \\nnormally unicellular, divide by budding and may produce non prosthecate appendages \\ncalled stalks, grow in aquatic habitats.) Ex. - Isosphaera \\n2. Phylum: Chlamydiae (small phylum, obligate, intracellular parasite with unique \\nlife cycle involving two distinctive stages-elementary bodies and reticulate bodies, small \\ncoccid form with no appendages. Important pathogen and cause many human diseases). \\n3. Phylum Spirochaetes : (contain helically shaped, motile, gram - ve bacteria with \\nunique morphology and motility, chemoheterotroph, free living, symbiotic, parasitic. It \\nhas special exterior boundry the outer membrane that surrounds the protoplasmic \\ncylinder. Several important human pathogens). Ex. Spirochaetes \\n4. Phylum: Bacteroidetes - (it has three classes, Ex. - Bacteroides, Flavobacterium, \\nFlexibacter. ) \\nThus Bergey\\'s manual is the principle resource in prokaryotic, taxonaomy and is \\nused by micro~iologists around the world. \\nFinally, it is emphasized that prokaryotic nomenclature is as much in flux as \\nclassification. The names of families and genera are fairly well established and stable \\nin the new system (At least in the absence of future discoveries). \\n000BACTERIA \\nThe word bacterium (Gk. Bakterion = little rod) originally applied by microscopists \\nfor rod shaped organism, belonging to the lowest order of the plant life or \"microscopic \\nunicellular plants without chlorophyll that reproduce by fission\". \\nAntony Von Leuvenhoek (1632 - 1723), the dutch dry goods merchant of Holland, \\nis credited with the discovery of bacteria. He observed bacteria in the scum of teeth \\nwith the help of microscope constructed by himself. He named them as \"tiny \\nanimalcules\". In 1695 he published his work \"The secrets of nature discovered by Antony \\nVan Leeuvenhoek\" for this discovery he has been called as \"Father of Bacteriology\". \\nLater Ehrenberg (1829) coined the term bacteria for these microorganism. The term \\nbacteria literally means, small stick. \\nCarl Weigert (1845-1904) developed the staining technique for bacteria. T.J. Bwoul \\n(1878) said that the bacteria causes diseases in plants. \\nGeneral Characters of Bacteria \\nBacteriology is the branch of botany under which we study the metabolism and \\nreproduction of bacteria. The general characters of bacteria are: \\n1. They are omnipresent i.e. present in soil, air and water. \\n2. They are unicellular, prokaryotic microorganism. \\n3. The cell bears a thick rigid cell wall outside the plasma membrane (because \\nof this character they are kept in plant kingdom). \\n4. They have great variation in the mode of nutrition i.e. may be autotrophic and \\nheterotrophic. In heterotrophism mode of nutrition they may be parasite \\nsaprophyte or symbiotic in nature.72 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n5. They lack true chlorophyll but few photosynthetic bacteria have a special type \\nof chlorophyll called bacteriochlorophyll. \\n6. Because of the prokaryotic nature they lack true nucleus (lacking nuclear \\nmembrane and nucleolus), genetic material is in the form of composite structure \\nknown as genophorejnucleoidjincipient nucleus. \\n7. The cell wall of bacteria is made up of mucopeptide unlike the cell wall of \\nplants (where it is made up of cellulose) \\n8. They lack mitochondria, golgi apparatus, plastid and endoplasmic reticulum. \\n9. They lack basic protein histone in their DNA. \\n10. Ribosomes are of 70s type. \\n11. At some places the plasma membrane invaginate in folds to form mesosomes. \\n12. All the enzymes required for respiration are found in the cell membrane. \\n13. Both DNA and RNA are present in the bacterial cell. DNA is in the form of \\nsingle circular chromosome (therefore the ce.il is haploid) \\n14. Vegetative reproduction is generally by binary fission, cyst, budding and \\ngonidia. \\n15. Asexual reproduction is by conidia, motile spores and endospore. \\n16. True sexual reproduction is absent in bacteria but there are examples of genetic \\nrecombination which may be of following types viz. conjugation, transduction \\nand transformation. \\nPlant like characteristic in bacteria \\nCohn (1872) reported the presence of cell wall in bacteria (which is a character \\nsimilar to plants). Along with this the various factor responsible for keeping bacteria \\nin plant kingdom are as follows: \\n(i) The cell wall is made up of cellulose in few bacteria. \\n(ii) They show filamentous growth like some plants. \\n(iii) Like plant autotrophic bacteria produces carbonic food by the use inorganic \\nsubstances (C02 and H 20). \\n(iv) Structure and some mode of reproduction of bacteria is similar to some \\nmembers of thallophyta. \\n(v) They absorb the nutritional substances in the soluble form through their cell \\nwall (like plants). \\n(vi) Bacteria has the ability to convert inorganic nitrogen into all types of -NH2 \\nacids. \\n(vii) Most of the transitional forms of bacteria and fungi are found in the nature. \\nSimilarities between Bacteria and Blue Green Algae : \\n1. Both groups bears a prokaryotic nucleus.BACfERIA 73 \\n2. Both are unicellular or colonial and the complicated structures are in filamentous \\nform. . \\n3. Both groups have similar cell wall structure and cell division. \\n4. Both lack the typical cellular organelles found in eukaryotic cells. \\n5. Genetic material is DNA without histone proteins. \\n6. Cells are surrounded by gelatinous sheath. \\n7. Both have similar cell forms viz. spherical, cylindrical and spiral. \\nB. No zoospores are formed during asexual reproduction in blue green algae and \\nbacteria. \\n9. Members of both the groups can withstand dessication and high temperatures. \\n10. Like saprophytic bacteria, blue green algae can live on dead organic matter \\nin the absence of light. \\n11. Genetic recombination is present in both blue green algae and bacteria. \\nDissimilarities between Cyanobacteria and Bacteria : \\n1. Cyanobacteria are always aflagellate while most of the bacteria are flagellate. \\n2. All cyanobacteria are aerobic while many bacteria are anaerobic. \\n3. All cyanobacteria have chlorophyll a for photosynthesis while bacteria bears \\nbacteriochlorophyll. \\n4. The source of hydrogen is H 2S in bacteria whereas it is H 20 in cyanobacteria. \\nDISTRIBUTION \\nBacteria are ubiquitousj omnipresent in their distribution. They are found in all \\nthe natural habitats i.e. soil, water and air. They occur in all the situations except in \\npits of volcanoes, deep strata or rock and rain water, distilled water in deep wells, blood \\nof normal animals. They constitute a major part of the soil microflora and intestine of \\nanimals. Viz. E. coli in the intestine of human being. Some species have been found \\nin extreme hot spring as well as extreme cold condition, these are referred to as \\nthermophilic (survive on 7B°C) and psychrophillic (on-190°C) respectively. They can \\ntolerate and remain alive at a pH lower than 1 at one end and 13 at another end. \\nGenerally 1 gm soil contains about 1000-10 million bacteria. \\nBacteria also occurs in a variety of foods and food products viz fruit, vegetables, \\nmilk, butter, cheese and milk beverages. \\nSTRUCTURE OF BACTERIAL CELL \\nSize: There is great variation in size of bacteria. They are so minute which can\\'t \\nbe seen without the help of microscope. On an average each cell of bacterium measures \\n1.25 - 2 !lm in diameter and 2-10 !lm in length. Cocci are about 0.5-2.5 Ilm in diameter\\' \\nwhile bacilli are 0.3-15!l x 0.2 -21l. The smallest rod shaped eubacterium is Dialister \\npneumosintes which measure in between 0.15!l-0.31l in size. The biggest bacteria Beggiatoa \\nmirabilis is about 16-45 Il in diameter and BO!l in length.74 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nSHAPES AND FORMS OF BACTERIA \\nBacterial cells differ in their shapes but usually three conventional shapes have \\nbeen recognized. Initially the classification of bacteria was based on their shapes but \\nnow it is not used. The various shapes are as follows: \\n(1) EllipsoidaVSphericaVCocci \\nThe term cocci has originated from a greek word; kokkos = grain or kernel. It is \\nthe simplest form of bacteria in which bacteria appears like a minute sphere (0.5~ -\\n1.25~ in diameter) they lack flagella. On the basis of arrangements cocci are further \\nclassified as follows: \\n1. Micrococci: When a bacterium appears singly e.g. Micrococcus agitis, M. aureus. \\n2. Diplococcus: When they appear in a pairs of cells e.g. Diplococcus pneumoniae. \\n3. Streptococci: When they appear in rows of cells or in chains e.g. Streptocoocus \\nlactis. \\n4. Staphylococci: When they arrange in irregular clusters like bunches of grapes \\ne.g. Stapllyloccolls aureus. \\n5. Tetracoccus: When they arrange in a sequence of four e.g. Neisseria and \\nMicrocOCCIiS te trogen us. \\n6. Sarcinae: When they arrange in cuboidal or in a different geometrical or packet \\narrangements e.g. Sarcillae lutea. \\n(2) Rod Shaped Bacteria or Bacillus \\nThe word bacillus originated from greek word, bacillii means rod or stick. There \\nends are rounded flat or pointed. There size ranges from 0.5-1.2~ in diameter and 3-\\n7~ in length. They may be flagellated or non-flagellated. Most of the bacteria causing \\ndisease in plants belongs to bacilli category. They may be of following types: \\n(i) Monobacillus: When they arrange singly. \\n(ii) Diplobacillus: When they are present in a group of two e.g. Diplobacillus \\npncu/Iloniae. \\n(iii) Streptobacillus : When they appear in chains e.g. Bacillus tuberculosis. \\n(iv) Palisade: Very rarely the bacillus arrange in a palisade arrangement. \\n(3) Spiral or Helical \\nThe origin of word is from greek word; spira means coiled. They appear like a \\ncork screw. A single spirillum has more than one turn of helix. Generally they are found \\nas free living, unicellular entity. There size ranges from 10-50~ in length and 0.5 - 3~ \\nin diameter. They are flagellated e.g. Spirillum minus, S. volutans. \\n(4) Vibrio or Coma \\nThe bacteria of this group are like \\'coma or small curved rod. They bear flagellaBACTERIA 75 \\nat their end. Their size ranges from 1.5-l.71l in diameter and upto lOll in length e.g. \\nVibrio cholarae. \\n(5) Spirochaeta \\nThese bacteria appears like a cork screw and atrichous. Their length is more as \\ncompared to their diameter. Their body is more flexible. \\n(6) Filamentous \\nThese type of bacteria are generally found in sewage water and the water coming \\nout from sugar industry or effluent of sugar industry e.g. Sphaerotilus natalls. Basically \\nthey are rod shaped bacilli which grow in an elongated chain and are covered by a \\ntubular envelope. Ferrous containing water generally contain filamentous bacteria e.g. \\nLeptothrix, Cladothrix, Nocardia and Beggiatoa. \\n(7) Stalked \\nThese bacteria are enveloped by a extra cellular structure which encloses the entire \\ncell. This structure is known as prosthecae which is a slightly hard appendage \\nappendacular structure. Because of the presence of Prostheceae they are known as \\nprosthecate bacterium. These bacteria are classified in following two groups. \\n(a) The bacteria in which prostheceae does not take part in reproduction e.g. \\nColobacter. \\n(b) The bacteria where prosthecae participate in reproduction e.g. Hypomicrobium. \\nThere stalk is about 20ll in length and are formed in nutrient media rich in \\nphosphate. The basal end of the stalk is either knobbed structure or sticky in nature. \\nMany colobacter cells unite with their lower basal knob and arrange like the petals of \\na rose. \\n(8) Pleomorphic \\nMany bacteria change their shape and structure with the change in environmental \\nconditions. These bacteria which are found in various forms are known as pleomorphic \\nbacteria e.g. Acetobacter. \\n(9) Budding Bacteria \\nThese are of football shaped structure with a swollened part and a thin tube. This \\ntube gradually increases in size and its terminal end swells up to form new cell which \\nis globular and ultimately a net work of cell is formed e.g. Rhodomicrobium. \\nULTRASTRUCfURE OF BACfERIAL CELL \\nAs bacterial cells are very minute, they are studied under electron microscope in \\nwhich it reveals various structures. Some of these are external to the cell wall while \\nother are internal to the cell wall. The brief descriptions of the readily evident structures \\nof bacteria is as follows :76 \\nRod shaped \\nor \\nBacilus \\nSpherical \\nor \\nCoccus \\nSpiral, \\nVibrio, \\nStalked & \\nBranched \\nI\\n·~: .. ,. ..... . \" :~.T.\\' \\n.. !::. .. , . .,: . \\nTEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nFig. 1 : Different shapes of bacteria \\n(i) Structure external to cell wall. \\n(a) Flagella (b) Pili (Fimbriae) (c) Capsules (d) Sheaths \\n(e) Prostheceae and stalks (f) Cell wallBACTERIA 77 \\n(ii) Structure internal to cell wall \\n(a) Cytoplasmic membrane (b) Intracellular membrane system (c) Cytoplasm \\n(d) Cytoplasmic inclusions and vacuoles (e) Nuclear material \\nPlasma Respiratory Fimbriae Cytoplasm \\nCell wall membrane chain (Pili) Capsule 1 \\n~ \\nPolysome mRNA Mesosome Nucleoid Internal Free Free Flagellum \\n(DNA) membrane ribosome onzyme \\nFig. 2 : Generalized diagram of a bacterium \\nSTRUcrURE EXTERNAL TO THE CELL WALL \\n(a) Flagella \\nBacteria can be motile or non motile. The motile form swim by means of small \\nflexible, whip like appendage called flagella (singular flagellum). They are much thinner \\nthan the flagella or cilia of eukaryotes. A typical bacterial flagellum measures about \\n120Ao thick and 4-5 Il long. Chemically they are made up of protein with a molecular \\nweight of about 40,000. The protein of the filament is known as flagellin. These bacterial \\nflagellum lacks 9 + 2 arrangement (like eukaryotes) \\nThe location of flagella varies in various bacteria. The bacteria which lack flagella \\nare referred as atrichous e.g. Diptheria bacilli and many cocci viz. Lactobacillus and Pasturella. \\nThe number and position of the attachments of the flagella on the bacterial wall vary \\naccording to the species. Therefore bacteria can be divided into following types : \\n(i) Monotrichous: Single flagellum at one end of the cell e.g. Cholera vibrio & \\nPseudomonas citri. \\n(ii) Lophotrichous: Two or more flagella at one end or both ends of the cell e.g. \\nSpirillum lllldula. \\n(iii) Amphitrichous: One or many flagella at the end of the cell e.g. Spirilla and \\nNitrosomonas. \\n(iv) Peritrichous: Many flagella attached all round the cell e.g. ,Salmonella sp. and \\nClostridium.78 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(A) Monotrichous (8) Lophotrichous \\n(C) Amphitrichous (D) Peritrichous \\nFig. 3 : Various arrangement of bacterial flagella. \\nULTRASTRUCTURE OF FLAGELLUM \\nGenerally a single flagellum is ten times long as compared to their bacterial cell. \\nThere size is variable in different species but average size ranges from 4-10~ in length \\nand 120 AO - 180Ao in diameter. These flagellum are generally made up of subunits \\nof flagellin protein. The molecular weight of these subunit is 40,OOt) dalton and 40A ° \\nin diameter. This flagellin protein is synthesized inside the bacterial cytoplasm and are \\ntransferred to the terminal distal part of the flagellum, thus the growth of flagellum \\nis from apical part inspite of its basal part. About 12 genes are found responsible for \\nthe synthesis of various parts of flagellum. Each bacterial flagellum is structurally \\ndifferentiated into three parts (1) basal body (2) hook (3) main filament or shaft. \\n(1) Basal Body: It is a small rod like structure which is attached deep in the \\ncytoplasm of the bacterial cell. This cytoplasm provide energy to this flagellum. In gram \\n-ve bacterium it possesses two sets of rings (i) a proximal set (ii) a distal set. Each \\nset consist of two pairs of rings. Outer pair is attached to the cell wall while inner \\npair is attached to the cell membrane. Thus total 4 rings are present and named as \\n(i) Membrane (ii) Supermmembrane (iii) Peptidoglycan ring (iv) Lipopolysaccharide ring. \\nThey are arranged from inner side to outerside. M ring is attached to plasma membraneBACI\\'ERIA 79 \\nwhile P and L ring structurally form a bearing for the flagellar rod to pass through \\nouter membrane. The flagellum of gram positive bacterium lacks the outer set of rings. \\nThe main function of basal body is (i) to synthesize the polymers of flagellum (ii) \\nregulation of flagellar movement. \\n(ii) Hook : Hook connects the basal body and main filament or shaft. It originates \\nfrom cell wall and the length of hook of gram negative bacterium is shorter than of \\ngram positive bacterium. The main features of hook are: \\nThey provide specific shape to the flagellum. \\nEach hook has specific antigenic property in each bacterium. \\n(3) Filament or Shaft : This is a tubular structure attached to the hook. It is 20J.! \\nlong 0.01-0.13J.! in diameter. It is made up of globular protein subunits. The amino acid \\ninvolve in the synthesis of proteins are histidine, cystine and tryptophane. These protein \\nsubunits are arranged helically and form cylindrical fibrils. The protein is called flagellin. \\nThe bacterial flagellum is made up of single thin fibril while eukaryotic motile cells \\nhas a fibrill arranged in 9 + 2 pattern. \\nFUNCTIONS OF FLAGELLA \\nThe main function of flagellum is to provide motility to the bacterial cell. \\nPeptidoglycan \\nlayer \\nPeri plasmic \\nspace \\nHook \\n,....------Grommet \\n~mtl~~m~~~:~~,.5~I.,.~ Cytoplasmic \\nmembrane \\nFig. 4 : Structure of flagellum of a gram +ve bacterium \\nPILI OR FIMBRAE \\nThese are hair like appendages present on the surface of most of the gram negative \\nbacteria (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomondaceae and Caulobacter). They are smaller than \\nflagella, have no role in the motility of bacteria. They measure 0.2-20J.! in length and \\n30-140Ao in width. A single bacterial cells bears about 100-500 pili which are arranged \\nperitrichously. There origin is from cytoplasm and penetrate through the peptidoglycan \\nlayers of the cell wall. Chemically they are composed of 100% protein named fimbrilin \\nwith a molecular weight of about 16,000. Fimbrilin consist of about 163 amino acids. \\nFollowing two types of pili are found in bacteria viz.80 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nr 17nm \\n1 \\n/\\nouter \\nL membrane \\n~~~ \\nFilament \\nHook--____________ ~ \\n8asalbody \\n~ \\nPeptidoglycan \\n~:::;~~~P layer \\n~~~~~s...l / Cy10plasmic ~ My membrane \\nFig. 5 : Structure of flagellum of gram -ve bacterium \\n(a) Somatic pili (b) Sex pili or conjugate pili \\n(a) Somatic Pili : Each bacterial cell bears about 100 somatic pili whose main \\nfunction is to help the bacterium for attachment to a substratum. \\n(b) Sex Pili or Conjugate Pili : They are also known as F pili and are controlled \\nby sex factors. These pili are comparatively long (20 ll) and broad in width (65-135AO). \\nThere number ranges from 1-10 in male or donor bacterium, but in some bacterium \\nit is found in both viz. Male donor (+ factors) or female receptor/ receiver (-factor). \\nAt the time of conjugation the sex pili of male donor recognize the receptor protein \\non the surface of female or recipient and get attached with the help ot conjugation tube. \\nThe DNA from the donor to recipient is transferred through this conjugation tube. There \\nare two types of sex pili in E.coli. They are F. pili and I.pili. \\nIn certain pathogenic bacteria these pili help the bacteria in the attachment of \\npathogenic bacterial cell to the host cells. There are generally four types of pili classified \\non the basis of their attachment ability to the host cell : \\n(a) Type I : There diameter is about 90A ° and found in E.coli, Serratia & Salmonella. \\n(b) Type II : They lack the attachment ability e.g. some species of Salmonella. \\n(c) Type III : Their attachment ability is effected by mannose sugar. They are about \\n50 A ° in diameter e.g. Klebsiella and some spp. of Salmonella. \\n(d) Type IV : They are found in Proteus bacteria. \\nFunctions of Pili \\n(i) They help the bacteria to attach themselves to the natural substrate or to other \\norganism due to its adhesive properties. \\n(ii) They bear antigenic properties.BACfERIA 81 \\n(iii) Sex pili are helpful in chromosome transfer during conjugation by acting as \\nconjugation tube. \\n(iv) They act as bacteriophage receptor. \\nFig. 6 : F-piIus \\nCapsules \\nSome bacterial cells are surrounded by a viscous substance forming a covering layer \\nor envelope around the cell wall called capsule. Electron microscopic study has revealed \\nthat capsule consist of a mesh or network of fine strands. This capsule only helps \\nin disease causing ability of a few types of bacteria. This capsule is divided into two \\ngroups: \\n(a) Macrocapsule: It is about O.21lm thick and can be seen under light microscope. \\n(b) Microcapsule: It can\\'t be seen under light microscope but can be demonstrated \\nimmunologically. \\nChemically the capsules are made up of di or polysaccharide or polypeptide. The \\npolysaccharide may be homo polysaccharide (composed of single kind of sugar) e.g. \\nStreptococcus mutans ot it may be heteropolysaccharide (composed of several kind of \\nsugars) e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae. \\nFunctions \\n(i) They provide protection against temporary drying by binding water molecules. \\n(ii) They may be antiphagocytic i.e. they inhibit the engulfment of pathogenic \\nbacteria by W.B.C. and contribute to invasive ability. \\nSheaths \\nSome species of bacteria of freshwater and marine environment form chains or \\ntrichomes which are enclosed by a hollow tube called sheath. Sheaths may be sometimes \\nimpregnated with ferric or manganese hydroxides which strengthen them . \\nProstheceae and Stalks \\nThese are semirigid extensions of cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane . They are \\ncharacteristic of a number of aerobic bacteria from freshwater and marine environment. \\nThese prosthecae may be single (ex. Caulobacter) or several (Ancalomicrobrillm) \\nThe main function of prostheceae is that they increase the surface area of the cells \\nfor nutrient absorption in the dilute environment. \\nStalk are non living ribbon like or tubular appendages that are excreted by the \\ncell. The~ stalk aid in attachment of the cells to surfaces e.g. Plallctomyces.82 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nTHE CELL WALL \\nBelow these external structures viz. capsules, sheaths, flagella and above to the \\ncytoplasmic membrane is the cell wall. This is a very rigid structure and provide definite \\nshape to the cell. Since most of the bacteria lives in hypotonic environment, this cell \\nwall prevent the cell from expanding and eventually bursting because of uptake of water. \\nThe cell wall is resistant to extremely high pressure. The cell wall constitutes a significant \\nportion of the dry weight of the cell, it may account for as such 10-40% of the dry \\nweight of bacterial cell. Bacterial cell walls are usually essential for the growth and \\ndivision of bacteria. \\nGenerally the cell wall is made up of large number of layers. The thickness of \\nthese different layers varies both in gram +ve and gram -ve bacteria. The walls of gram \\n-ve species are generally thinner (10-15 nm) than those of gram +ve species (20-25 nm). \\nSTRUCTURE AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION \\nThe most important constituent of the cell wall of eubacteria is peptidoglycan \\n(sometimes called murein) which is an insoluble, porous, cross-linked polymer of \\nenormous strength and rigidity. This peptidoglycan is only found in prokaryotes. It is \\nbasically a polymer of N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG), N acetylmuramic acid (NAM), and \\n4 amino acids (L-alanine, D-alanine, D-glutamate and a diamino acids). \\nThe tetrapeptide of one peptidoglycan layer is cross linked with the other \\npeptidoglycan layer and as a result a strong framework is formed around the cell and \\nimpart great rigidity to the total structure. Some antibiotics viz. penicillin inhibit the \\nsynthesis of this framework thus the cell wall synthesis is stopped. \\nTetrapeptide side chain \\nPeptide cross bridge \\n__ --Carbohydrate \\n\\'backbone\\' \\nFig. 7 : General structure of peptidoglycan \\nWalls of Gram +ve and Gram -ve Bacteria \\nGram + ve bacteria have a much greater amount of peptidoglycan in their cell \\nwalls than do gram - ve bacteria. The cell wall of these bacteria consist of about 40-BACfERIA 83 \\n80% of peptidoglycan of the dry weight of cell wall. This peptidoglycan is of about \\n40 or more layers in gram + ve bacteria. The cell wall measures about 30-80 nm in \\nthickness. Teichoic acid or acidic polysaccharide are mainly present in gram positive \\nbacteria and are found associated with peptidoglycan by a single terminal covalent bond. \\nTeichoic acid is a negatively charged substituted polysaccharide polymer made up of \\nribitol and glycerol residues joined through diphosphoester linkages. It constitute a major \\nCell \\nwall \\n(a) \\nO-polysaccharide Core polysaccharide \\nOuter \\nmembrane \\n(b) \\nFig. 8 : Cell walls of (a) gram +ve and (b) gram -ve bacteria \\nOut \\nLipopoly\\xad\\nsaccharide \\n(LPS)84 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nsurface antigen. It is hydrophilic and its main function is to transport positively charged \\nsubstances to the bacterial cell in the storage of phosphorous. Teichoic acid was \\ndiscovered by Baddiley (1933). \\nCell Wall of Gram Negative Bacteria \\nThe wall of gram - ve bacteria are more complex than those of gram + ve bacteria. \\nThe envelop of this kind of bacteria is made up of two unit membranes and are separated \\nby 100Ao space known as periplasmic region and contains a peptidoglycan layer. The \\noutermost membrane is known as cell wall while the inner one is referred as cytoplasmic \\nmembrane . Peptidoglycan is only about 5-10% of the dry weight of cell wall. The outer \\nmembrane serve as selective barrier for various external chemicals and enzymes that \\ncould damage the cells. Its structure is similar to plasma membrane or cell membrane. \\nThe outer membrane is anchored to the underlying peptidoglycan by means of Braun\\'s \\nlipoprotein. The membrane is bilayered structure consisting mainly of phospholipids \\nprotein and lipopolysaccharide (L.P.S.). The phospholipids are bilayered consisting of \\nboth hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends. The wall contains 4 types of protein components \\nalong with other major types of protein called lipoprotein. \\nThe Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has toxic properties and is also known as endotoxin. \\nIt occurs only in the outer layer of the membrane and is composed of three covalently \\nlinked parts : \\n(i) Lipid A = firmly embedded in the membrane. \\n(ii) Core polysaccharide = located at the membrane surface. \\n(iii) O-antigens = which extend like whiskers from the membrane surface into the \\nsurrounding medium . Many antigenic properties of gram - ve bacteria are \\nattributable to O-antigens. \\nThe outer membrane is although impermeable to large molecules but can allow \\nsmaller molecules such as nucleosides, oligosaccharide, monosaccharides, pep tides and \\namino acids. This is accomplished by means of channels in special proteins called porins. \\nStructure Internal to Cell Wall \\nCytoplasmic Membrane: Immediate below the cell wall is cytoplasmic membrane \\nwhich is similar in both gram + ve and gram -ve bacteria. It is about 75 nm thick \\nbilayered membrane and is composed primarily of phospholipids (about 20-30%) and \\nproteins (about 60-70%) . The phospholipid form a bilayer in which most of the proteins \\nare tenaciously held (integral proteins). These protein only can be removed by \\ndestruction of the membrane or by the treatment with detergents. Other proteins are \\nloosely attached (peripheral proteins) and can be removed by mild treatment such \\nas osmotic shock. Each phospholipids molecule of the bilayer has both hydrophilic \\nhead facing outwards and a hydrophobic tail facing towards each other. The lipid \\nmatrix of the membrane has fluidity. This type of structure of plasma membrane is \\nknown as fluid mosaic model. \\nThe cytoplasmic membrane act as a hydrophobic barrier for the penetration of mostBACTERIA 85 \\nwater soluble molecules. However specific proteins in the membrane facilitate the \\npassage of small molecules (nutrients and waste products) across the membrane. \\nThe cytoplasmic membrane also contains various enzymes involved in respiratory \\nmetabolism and in synthesis of capsular and cell wall components. \\nINTRACELLULAR MEMBRANE SYSTEM \\nMesosome : Bacterial cell do not contain membrane bound organelles (Viz. \\nmitochondria, chloroplast, golgi apparatus etc). But in bacteria the cytoplasmic \\nmembrane have specialized invagiantions that can increase their surface area for certain \\nfunction. \\nEspecially in gram positive bacteria these membrane invaginations are in the form \\nof convoluted tubules and vesicles termed mesomes. They are well developed in bacilli, \\nand may be 2-4 in number in each cell. Their number is higher in those bacteria involved \\nin higher respiratory activity e.g. Azatobacter. The mesosomes may be central or \\nperipheral in position. The central mesosome penetrate deeply into the cytoplasm and \\nlocated ncar the middle of the cell, and seemed to be attached to the genetic material \\nof the cell and thought to be involved in replication of DNA and cell division. While \\nthe peripheral mesosome show only a shallow penetration into the cytoplasm seem to \\nbe involved in export of exocellular enzymes such as penicillinase. \\nThe nature of mesosome was initially considered to be equivalent to mitochondria \\nof higher plants and considered to be pockets of respiratory activity since they lack \\nouter membrane they are not considered analogous to mitochondria. Along with this \\nit is also devoid of many plasma membrane enzymes viz. ATPase, dehydrogenase, \\nand cytochrome. It has been suggested that mesosomes help in the formation of septum. \\nRibosomes : Ribosomes are found in free floating conditions and are randomoly \\ndistributed in the cytoplasm. They constitute about 30% of the total weight of the \\nbacterium (10,000 -15000 ribosome in a bacterial cell).

During protein synthesis a number \\nof ribosomes are held together by mRNA and form polyribosomes. The number of \\nribosome is directly proportional to the rate of protein synthesis. \\nThe ribosome of prokaryote are of 70s type whose molecular weight is about \\n2.7 million. Each 70s ribosome is composed of two subunits larger 50S and a smaller \\n30S. At low concentration of Mg+2 ions these 70S ribosome is dissociated into its two \\nsubunits. \\nRibosome of E. coli bacteria is made up of 63% RNA and 37% protein or they \\nare in 2:1 ratio. Many antibiotics like streptomycin and tetracycline who inhibit the \\nprotein synthesis in bacterial cell have a main target on the ribosome of the bacterium. \\nLamellae or Chromatophore : Lamellar thylakoid or vesicles are found in many \\nphotosynthetic bacteria. They are known as chromatophores. Lamellae are synthesized \\nby two unit membranes. These membranes are distributed throughout the cytoplasm. \\nThese chromatophore are hollow rounded structure with a diameter of about 300A 0. \\nThey bears photosynthetic pigments, enzyme required for light reaction, ETS system \\nof photophosphorylation. They lack the enzyme required for dark reaction.86 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nCytoplasm : Cytoplasm is the part of bacterial cell surrounded by cell membrane. \\nThe 80% of cytoplasm is water, rest is nucleic acid, protein, lipids, carbohydrates \\ninorganic ions and compounds of low molecular weight. The cytoplasm of prokaryote \\nlack cytoplasmic streaming and cytoskeleton. \\nCYfOPLASMIC INCLUSIONS \\nConcentrated deposits of a variety of reserve materials are detactable in the \\ncytoplasm of some bacteria,. They have high molecular weight and usually Osmotically \\ninert. They are mainly of three types : \\n(i) Polymetaphosphate (Po3-)n : They are also known as volutin granule or \\nmetachromatic granules which appear reddish violet after staining with methylene blue. \\nThey are most common in Spirillum volutans, Conjnebacterium diphtheriae and Mycobacteria. \\nThis is required during nucleic acid synthesis. \\n(ii) Poly p-Hydroxybutyrate : They serve as source of metabolic energy and stained \\nwith sudan black. It is found in Bacillus megatherium who contain about 60% of the dry \\nweight. \\n(iii) Polyglucan Granules: They appear blue, reddish blue or brown when stained \\nwith iodine. \\n(iv) Sulphur inclusions: They are found in bacteria growing in environment rich \\nin sulphur e.g. purple sulphur bacteria which utilize H 2S either as e- donor during \\nphotosynthesis or non-photosynthetic bacteria e.g. Beggiatoa and Thiothrix. \\nGAS VACUOLES \\nSome bacteria living in aquatic habitat form gas vacuoles that provide buoyancy. \\nIn light microscope these are bright, refractile bodies and can be made to collapse \\nunder pressure and there by lose their refraction. The wall is made up of protein \\nego Non pigmented members of phototroph bacteria like Polynema, Holobacterium & \\nClostridium. \\nNUCLEAR MATERIAL \\nLike other prokaryote, bacteria lack a well defined nucleus. Its genetic material \\nis designated under the area near the center of the cell and regarded as nucleoid/ \\nchromatin body or bacterial chromosome since it consist of sbgle circular DNA molecule \\nin which all genes are linked. It can be made visible under the light microscope by \\nFeulgen staining which is specific for DNA. Under Electron microscopy it appears as \\na light area with a delicate fibrillar structure. Its size measures, about 1000~ in length \\nand 3 nm in diameter. Its molecular weight is nearly 5 x 109• It has about 4000 genome \\nwhose replication is by semiconservative method. The bacterial chromosome differ from \\neukaryote chromosome in lacking histone (basic) protein however polyamines may be \\nfound to some of the phosphate group of the bacterial DNA. Polyamines are small \\nmolecules rich in amino groups.BACTERIA 87 \\nThe cross section of nucleoid show 500-900 strands folded back and forth several \\nhundred times. The size of nucleoid increases during replication. \\nPlasmid and Episomes: In many bacteria in addition to nucleoid there is an extra \\nsmall circular DNA segment which is in the form of ring is called Plasmid. There \\nreplication is autonomous. This extrachromosomal DNA fragment was first discovered \\nby Lederberg (1952). They are extrachromosomal, self replicating and stably inherited, \\nwhose size ranges from about 20-100 kb pairs (a bacterial chromosome is about 4000 \\nkbp). Plasmid has an independent replication and contain own system for initiating \\nand controlling the replication. The numbers of genes in plasmid vary from 3-4 who \\nhas no role in viability and growth of bacteria. Two types of plasmids have been \\nidentified: \\n1. Conjugative Plasmid : It carries genes that promote the transfer of plasmids \\nfrom host cell to a receipient cell by conjugation. \\n2. Non-conjugative Plasmid: It can\\'t promote its own transfer by conjugation. \\nEpisomes are the plasmid which get integrated into the bacterial chromosomes. \\nIt was discovered by Jacob, Schaeffer and Wollman (1960) \\nThe first mentioned plasmid responsible for fertility was named as fertility factor \\nor F factor. It plays an important role in conjugation in E. coli. It is about 94.5 kb long \\ncarries the gene responsible for cell attachment and plasmid transfer between specific \\nstrains of bacteria during conjugation. \\n(\"\"--\"\\'\" New strand \\nFig. 9 : Bacterial Nucleoid \\nImportant characteristic of naturally occurring plasmids : \\n1. They replicate independently of the main chromosome. \\n2. They are species specific to one or few species of bacteria.88 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n3. They can undergo reversible integration into bacterial chromosome. \\n4. A few plasmid can pick up and transfer chromosomal gene. \\n5. They can be transferred by conjugation. \\n6. They usually contain upto 40 genes. \\n7. They do not occur free in nature. \\nNUTRITION \\nAll form of life from microorganism to human beings share certain nutritional \\nrequirements for growth and normal functioning. Generally the bacteria are classified \\nin two nutritional types on the basis of their nutrition requirement: \\n, (1) Autotrophic (2) Heterotrophic \\n(1) Autotrophic \\nA very small group of bacteria possess this type of nutrition. Few bacteria possess \\nphotosynthetic pigment bacteriochlorophyll other than normal chlorophyll found in \\nhigher plants are called photosynthetic bacteria. Thus autotrophic bacteria are of two \\ntypes: \\n(i) Photosynthetic bacteria (ii) Chemosynthetic bacteria \\n(I) Photosynthetic Bacteria \\nThis type of bacteria possess a special type of pigment called bacteriochlorophyll. \\nAlong with this other pigment viz. BactE~riviridin or chlorobium chlorophyll is also found. \\nThese pigments are found on spiral structures called chromatophores. Like other higher \\ngreen plants they synthesize carbohydrate by the fixation of atmospheric CO 2, Generally \\nthis fixation process occur in the presence of sulphur compounds which is mainly H 2S \\n(hydrogen sulphide). Therefore it can be said that hydrogen sulphide is main hydrogen \\nsource in photosynthesis in bacteria and here sulphur is produced as byproduct in place \\nof oxygen (produced in higher plants) in the chemical reaction. \\nThe chemical reaction of photosynthesis is as follows \\nCO 2 + H 2S ~ (CH 20)n + 2S + H 20 + energy \\ne.g. Chromatium, Chlorobium and Chlorobacterium \\n(II) Chemosynthetic Bacteria \\nMany bacteria uses the energy released from different type of chemical reactions \\nfor the conversion of carbon dioxide into carbohydrate (because they cannot utilize the \\nphoto energy due to lack of chlorophyll). Therefore they use the energy released from \\nthe oxidation of certain substances sulphur and its compound. Ammonia, Nitrites, Iron, \\nHydrogen, Carbon monoxide, methane are certain chemical substances whose oxidation \\nis carried out by certain bacteria and the energy released is used by these bacteria for \\nthe synthesis of food. The important chemosynthetic bacteria are as follows: \\n(i) Sulphur Bacteria : The example of sulphur bacteria are Thiobacillus, Beggiatoa \\nand Thiothrix. These bacteria utilizes the energy released by the oxidation of sulphurBACTERIA 89 \\nand its compounds. For example Thiothrix oxidizes the hydrogen sulphide or mineral \\nsulphides into sulphur. This sulphur get stored inside the bacteria and later get converted \\ninto sulphate. \\n2H 2S + O 2 ~ 2S + 2H 20 + 122.2 kcal \\n2S + 2H 20 + 302 ~ 2H 2S04 + 248.4 kcal \\n(ii) Iron bacteria : These bacteria generally oxidize the ferrous ion into ferric ion \\nand releases energy. Eg - Leptothrix, Ballionella and Ferrobacillus. \\n4FeC0 3 + O 2 + 6H 20 ~ 4Fe(OHh + 4C0 2 + 81 Kcal \\n(iii) Hydrogen bacteria: These bacteria convert the molecular hydrogen into water \\nutilize the energy released during chemical reaction. Eg - Bacillus, Pantrotrophus, \\nHydromonas. \\n2H2 + O 2 ~ 2H 20 + 137 Kcal \\n(iv) Nitrifying bacteria: These bacteria utilize the energy released from nitrogen \\ncompound. They are generally of two types (i) those who oxidize ammonia into Nitrous \\ne.g. Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter (ii) who convert nitrite into nitrate e.g. NitrococCllS and \\nBactoderma. \\nAlong with this some chemo-organotroph bacteria are found who utilizes the carbon \\nand its compound as a source of energy they are of following types : \\n(i) Methane bacteria : These bacteria convert and oxidize methane into carbon \\ndioxide gas and water ego Methanococcus, Lactobacillus and Acetabacter. \\n(ii) Carbon bacteria : These bacteria use the energy released by the oxidation of \\ncarbon monoxide e.g. Bacillus oligocarbophilus. \\n\" 2CO + O 2 ~ 2C0 2 + Energy \\nHETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA \\nMost of the bacterial species are hetrotrophic in nature i.e. utilize nutrition from \\nother living being. Though they lack the photosynthetic pigment they are unable to utilize \\nsolar energy. These bacteria with the help of enzymes convert the complex organic \\ncompounds in soluble form and absorb them. These bacteria are classified into three \\ntypes: \\n(a) Saprophytic (b) Symbiotic (c) Parasitic bacteria \\n(a) Saprophytic Bacteria : They survive on dead and deteriorating organic \\ncompound. These bacteria absorb nutrition from them. Firstly they convert the complex \\norganic compound into soluble compound with the help of enzymes and then absorb \\nthem according to their requirement or absorb them conditionally. These bacteria are \\ninvolved in the deteoration of dead bodies. They also undergo the process of putrifaction \\nand fermentation of protein and carbohydrate respectively. They are generally facultative \\nparasites or obligate saprophyte. In case of facultative parasite, they can utilize nutrition \\nacting as parasite on living beings in case the dead organic matter is unavailable to \\nthem.90 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(b) Symbiotic bacteria: Those bacteria which grow and develop in close beneficial \\npartnership or association with other living organism are called symbiotic bacteria and \\nthe phenomenon is termed as symbiosis. For example these, bacteria occur in the root \\nnodules of leguminous plants where they fix free atmospheric nitrogen in the soil which \\nis utilized by plants and plants in turn provide them carbohydrate and shelter for proper \\ndevelopment ego Rhizobia spp. \\n(c) Parasitic bacteria: Those bacteria which feed themselves on living tissues (host) \\nare called parasitic bacteria. They are transmitted to the host by means of air, water \\nand food. These bacteria may be obligate parasite or facultative parasite or may \\npathogenic or non pathogenic. These bacteria cause well known harmful diseases in \\nplants and animals ego Citrus Canker, Ring rot of potato in plants and tetanus, typhoid, \\ntuberculosis and pneumonia in man. \\nREPRODUCTION IN BACTERIA \\nBacteria generally reproduce very commonly by vegetative and asexual mode of \\nreproduction. No sexual reproduction was reported by many microbiologist but electron \\nmicroscopic study reports the unidirectional genetic recombination among certain \\nbacteria. \\nReproduction in bacteria includes the following methods \\n(i) Vegetative reproduction \\nIt includes the following types \\n(1) Binary fission \\n(2) Budding \\n(3) Cyst \\n(4) Gonidia or segmentation \\n(1) Binary fission \\nThe most common and most important mode of cell division which occur in bacteria \\nwhen the environmental factor such as light, moisture, temperature are favourable is \\ntransverse binary fission. In this a single cell divides after developing a transverse septum \\n(cross wall). Bacilli and spiral bacteria divide along the longitudinal axis of the cell while \\nin coccus this division can be on any axis. Mesosomes play an important role in binary \\nfission. Binary fission occurs in following steps: \\n(a) Division of nuclear or genetic material : When bacterial cell attains its \\nmaximum size, it generally increase longitudinally. After that its circular DNA undergo \\nreplication and results into two DNA components. This replication is of semi conservative \\ntype. Now these two DNA moves to two opposite poles with the help of mesosomes. \\nBecause no spindle fibres are formed during this entire process, this division is known \\nas amitosis. \\n(b) Division of cytoplasm and septum formation: By the end of the division of \\nnuclear material, the cytoplasmic membrane start invagination in the middle of the cell.BAcrERiA 91 \\nThis invagination is of centripetal direction and the inner most layer of cell wall also \\ninvaginate along with the L2 layer of plasma membrane and it forms the septum initial. \\nThis invagination appears as constriction on the cell surface. This constriction continuously \\ndeepens and results into two daughter cells. Under favourable conditions a single binary \\nfission is completed within 18-20 minutes. But such a rapid rate of cell division cannot \\ncontinue for a long time because the rapid iPcrease in growth rate of bacterial population \\nis inhibited due to following reasons : \\n1. Lack of space, food, water, oxygen other salts and accumulation of their own \\nharmful waste products in the medium. \\n2. Environmental factors like light, temperature, moisture becomes unfavourable. \\n3. Death due to senescence and sometimes they are eaten by microscopic animals \\nand viruses. \\nTherefore survival rate of bacteria in nature is only 1 %. \\n(2) Budding \\nIn this type of process the bacterial cell wall gets thinned at the end of cell, and \\nit develops a cytoplasmic growth or protuberance which is covered by thin membrane. \\nThis structure is known as bud. It contain the part of genetic material of the parent \\ncell. This out growth increases in size and develops a constriction at its base and \\nultimately it gets separated from parent cell. Now this bud cell increases in size and \\nattain the size of parent cell ego Hypomicrobium. \\n(3) Cyst \\nCyst formation is very rare in bacteria ego Azotobacter. Cyst is a spherical cell which \\nis formed under unfavourable conditions. Here the entire protoplast of the bacterial cells \\nrounds up, shortened, constricts and separated from the cell wall. After that a thick \\ncell wall is formed around this entire structure. This structure is known as cyst and \\non germination it gives rise to a single vegetative cell. \\n(4) Gonidia or Segmentation \\nBacteria which produces extensive filamentous growth form gonidia. Here such \\nbacterial filament produces small bacillary or coccoid cells each of which give rise to \\nnew growth. \\n(ii) Asexual Reproduction: \\nIt is of following types : Increase font size like Vegetative Reproduction. \\n(1) By Conidia \\n(2) By Oidiospores \\n(3) By Sporangiospores \\n(4) By Motile spores \\n(5) By Endospores \\n(1) By Conidia \\nMany bacterial species viz Streptomyces produces small minute disc like rounded92 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nbodies in chains at the tip of their filamentous structure. They are formed in chains. \\nThe filamentous bearing conidia is known as conidiophores. Conidia are formed in \\nbasipetal succession. Each conidium germinate and produce new filamentous bacterium. \\n(2) By Oidiospores \\nThe entire filamentous structure of certain species of Actinomyces become septate \\nat its end. Thus numerous micro size reproductive units are formed which are known \\nas oidiospore. Each oidium on germination give rise to new filamentous bacteria. \\n(3) By Sporangiospores \\nMany branched filamentous bacteria become swollen at its terminal end and form \\nsporangia. The cytoplasm of these sporangia divided to form small sized sporangiospore \\nwhich on germination give rise to new filamentous bacteria under favourable condition. \\n(4) By Endospore \\nEndospore formation occurs in bacteria to tide over unfavourable environmental \\nconditions. They are produced under conditions of limited supply of carbon, nitrogen \\nand phosphorous. This process was first of all reported by Cohn (1817) and late by \\nKoch (1877). Endospores are generally formed in bacteria pathogenic to plants, animals \\nand human beings. Endospores are heat, chemical, drying, freezing and radiation \\nresistant bodies. They can survive under dormancy even upto 50 years and on getting \\nfavourable environmental conditions they may germinate to start a new bacterial \\nlife. \\nEndospores are found in bacteria like Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporolactobacillus, \\nSporosarcina and Desulfotomaclllu111. \\nGenerally a single cell transform into a single endospore but in certain cases two \\nendospores are also reported from a single cell. They may be oval, ellipsoidal or spherical \\nin shape and usually in central, terminal or sub-terminal in position. \\nThus endospore is a highly resistant structure. The resistant nature is due to \\nfollowing reasons: \\n(i) Lowest metabolic activities. \\n(ii) Very few amount of water. \\n(iii) Impermeable and protective nature of spore coat. \\n(iv) Lack of active enzymes. \\n(v) High percentage of Ca+ 2 ion in spore composition. \\n(vi) Presence of stabilizer compound i.e. Picolenic acid. \\nThe structure of endospore is variable in different species of bacteria. The cell wall \\nis multi layered and acquire more than half of the volume of spore. \\nThe bacterial protoplast core is mainly made up of DNA and is surrounded by \\ndense cytoplasm. Protein percentage is about 90% of the total volume of the protoplasm. \\nAn acid diocholinic acid act as stabilizer is found in cytoplasm. The amount of enzyme \\nis very low in the spore.BACfERIA 93 \\nThe protoplast of spore is surrounded by a very thin membrane known as core \\nmembrane. Membrane in turn is surrounded by spore wall made up of disulphide rich \\nprotein called Keratin. The spore wall is about 30-60% of the dry weight of the spore. \\nThis spore wall provide protection to the spore from unfavourable conditions and \\nharmful chemicals. \\nAn electron dense cortex is present between the spore wall and inner membrane. \\nThis cortex is made up of modified peptides. The endospore of Bacillus splzaericus lack \\nthe cortex. While in some bacteria an extra membrane, exosporium is found. Spore wall \\nis generally divided into outer and inner coat. \\nThe developmental stage of endospore formation in Bacillus subtile and Clostridium \\nhave been studied in detail and consist of stage 0 (Vegetative stage) to VII stage. \\nUnder unfavourable condition when there is no cellular division and there is \\nscarcity of A TP or energy in the cell, a special gene become active and is found \\nresponsible for the formation of endospore. In the presence of RNA polymerase enzyme \\nthis gene synthesize a special protein which initiate the formation of endospore in the \\ncell. \\nFitz-James & Young (1969) studied the process of formation of endospore in \\nClostridium Electron microscopically This can be divided into six main steps which are \\nas follows: \\n(1) 0 Stage: In this stage the cell which is going to form endospore, enlarges in \\nsize and its chromatin material condenses attain the shape of an axial filament reaching \\nfrom one end to the another end of the cell. \\n(2) I Stage: Axial filament develop completely. There is a change in the metabolic \\nactivity of the cell. \\n(3) II Stage: The plasma membrane start invaginating towards the one end of the \\ncell. This invagination grows centripetally and both the end unite to form a spore septum. \\nSeptum formation ends by the formation of a small spore known as fore spore. The \\ngenetic material also get transported to this structure. \\n(4) III Stage : Spore septum of both i.e. mother cell and fore spore grows around \\nthe protoplasm of fore spore by a process called engulfment. Thus fore spore lies freely \\nin the cytoplasm of mother cell. \\n(5) IV Stage : Cell wall of peptidoglycan is synthesized outside the plasma \\nmembrane of fore spore. This structure is called as spore wall. \\n(6) V Stage: There is a deposition of peptidoglycan cortex between the spore wall \\nand cell membrane. The protoplasm condenses and synthesize dipiconilic acid whose \\ndeposition occurs on cell membrane. There is an increase in the concentration of Ca +2, \\narginine and glutamic acid in the spore cytoplasm. Spore wall become multilayered. \\n(7) VI Stage : The spore mature into spore mother cell, the mother cell is called \\nas sporangium. \\n(8) VII Stage : There is autolysis of sporangium and the spore is released free \\nin the environment and it is transmitted by air.94 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe Endospore formation in Clostridium requires 2 hrs while Bacillus subtilis requires \\n7 hours. After transmission these endospores lie dormant for many years. \\nGERMINATION OF ENDOSPORE \\nThe process of germination start under favourable environmental conditions. Spore \\ncoat becomes soft by the imbibition of water. The cytoplasm of spore swells up by \\nabsorbing salts, nutrients and water. Thus as a result the upper spore coat breaks \\nup and the developing cell comes out. Generally a single spore is formed from a single \\nbacterial cell and on germination of a single spore a single bacterial cell is formed. \\nThus endospore formation is considered to be the perennation method of bacterium. \\nEndospores \\nBacterial cell \\nD \\nE \\nFig. 10 : Structure of endospore \\nSEXUAL REPRODUCfION OR GENETIC RECOMBINATION \\nUnlike other prokaryote no true sexual reproduction is found in bacteria because \\n(a) they lack sexual structures (b) no gametic fusion takes place. Karyogamy and meiosis \\nis also absent in bacteria. Bacteria are haploid organisms. Gene transfer in bacterial cell \\ndonot produce zygotes but partial diploid called mero-zygotes. The original genome \\nof recipient is named as endogenate. While the portion of DNA introduced from donar \\ncell into recipient cell is called exogenome. However three different mechanism were \\nlater discovered for transferring gene or genetic material from one bacterial cell to \\nanother. These mechanisms in order of their discovery are \\n(i) TransformationBACTERIA \\n(ii) Conjugation \\n(iii) Transduction \\n(i) Transformation \\n95 \\nIt was first observed by Griffith (1928) who noted the transformation of harmless \\nPneumococci into virulent ones. Here there is transfer and expression of naked DNA \\nfrom donor to recipient cell of bacteria takes place. \\nTransformation was discovered by Fredrick Griffith (1928) an English microbiologist \\nwhile working on two strains of Diplococcus pneu11lolliae (new name Streptococcus \\npneumoniae). He reported that DNA is a genetic material. \\nGriffith used two strains of D. p\"eu11loniae (i) bacteria with smooth and capsulated \\ncell wall called as SIll (virulent or pathogenic) \\n(ii) Bacteria with rough and non capsulated cell wall called as RII avirulent or non \\npathogenic). \\nSIll is found responsible for causing death in mice while RII does not cause \\npneumonia in mice. \\nHe carried out the following experiments on mice with these two strains. These \\nare as follows : \\n(i) No death of mice occur while injecting the RII bacterial strain in mic~. \\n(ii) Death of mice occur while injecting the SIll strain of bacteria. \\n(iii) No death occur in mice while injecting it with the heat killed (heated at 850q \\nSIll strain. \\n(iv) Death of mice occurred while injecting it with a combination of heat killed \\nSIll strain + live RII strain of Diplococcus pnhenumoniae. The virulent sm and \\nnon virulent RII strains were isolated from killed mice. Thus it was concluded \\nthat by receiving the genetic material of heat killed virulent SIll strain, the \\nliving RII strains produces the progeny of virulent and pathogenic sm strain. \\nAlthough Griffith was unable to identify the transforming principle. \\nBased on the Griffith experiment O.T. Avery, Macleod and Maccarty performed \\nfurther experiment in vitro system. They identified the transforming substance in 1944 \\nas the polysaccharide present in the capsule of virulent strain SIll of pneumococcus which \\nwas absent in non virulent RII strain. Thus it was concluded that the DNA fragments \\nisolated from dead mice get transformed into pathogenic and virulent sm strain. This \\nexperiment explained that DNA is a genetic material. \\nFor transformation the donor DNA must be single stranded and of specific size \\nwhich transforms very easily in the RII strain of bacteria. During transformation the \\nDNA fragment of SIll strain, bind and finally integrate in the bacterial chromosome \\nof RII strain. The replaced portion of DNA of RII strain get destroyed. \\nTransformation is entirely a laboratory procedure and never occur in nature. It is \\nfound in various bacterial spp. viz Bacillus, Haemophilus, Salmonella, Rhizobium etc.96 \\nS-III Virulent \\nstrain \\nee e8 \\n-+ \\nR-II Nonvirulent \\nS-III Virulent \\nss \\nR-II $$ -+ \\n00 \\nS-lIloo -+ \\nVirulent \\nCONJUGATION \\nTEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nInjected \\nII ,----....\\'nlo \\n~ \\ntDies \\nCulture Mice S-1I1 Recovered \\nInjected \\nLr~ \\n11\\\\ ~ \\n·E: --h t Lives \\nCulture Mice S-III Not recovered \\n~-b R-II living \\n(90-\\n,,\\n9\">\"0-. \\n~. \\n:: t9~ \\n-- ~ ;:; 0-\\nS-III~ Heat \\nkilled \\n-+ \\n1 Dies \\nS-III Recovered \\nFig. 11 : Griffith experiment \\nConjugation is the commonest process of sexual reproduction in bacteria. In \\nconjugation two parental cells physically contact between two genetically different cells \\nof the same or closely related species and transfer their genetic material through a small \\ntube like projection called conjugation tube. The genetic material from one cell (donor \\nor male) is transferred to other (recipient or female). \\nLederberg .and Tautum (1946) used two mutant of the E.coli strain K12. Both mutant \\nrequire certain growth factors while culturing on minimal media. These bacterial strain \\nare known as Auxotrophs. Strains A of E. coli require methionine and biotin for there \\ngrowth. There genotype is Met- Bio- while strain B require Thrionine, Leucine and \\nThiamine for their growth. There genotype is Thr-, Leu-, Thi-.BACTERIA 97 \\nThe culture of both, strain A and strain B of E. coli were mixed and centrifuged \\nand washed to remove the previous culture media. After that they were cultured in \\nminimal medium. It was found that both the strains were able to grow in minimal \\nmedium or it was concluded that both strains (previously auxotrophs) get converted \\ninto prototrophs or it was confirmed from the above experiment that the conjugation \\nrecombination of both auxotrophic strain viz. Strain A (met- bio-) and strain \\nB (Tht, Leu-, Thr-) resulted in the formation of prototrophic strain (Met+ Bio+ Thr+ Leu+ \\nThi+). This experiment explain th.e genetic recombination by conjugation. \\nFertility factor or F factor in conjugation was first of all discovered by William \\nHayes (1950) in E. coli. He reported that in E.coli a plasmid is present in the form of \\nfertility ~actor. E.coli is classified in two strains on the basis of presence and absence \\nof F factor. They are as follows : \\n(i) F+ strain bearing the fertility factor, also known as donor cell. It always bears \\nsex pili or F pili on its surface. \\n(ii) F- strain lacking the fertility factor, also known as recipient cell. It lacks sex \\npili or F pili on its surface. \\n(iii) According to Hayes in E. coli this sexual recombination is unidirectional where \\nthe genetic material is transferred to the recipient cell from the donor cell. This \\nprocess occurs in following steps : \\n(a) In a group of bacterial cell the cells of two opposite strains viz. F+ and \\nF- comes towards each other get attached by the sex pili. After that a tubular \\nstructure called as conjugation tube is formed. \\n(b) The DNA of bacterial plasmid is double stranded which become single \\nstranded by the activity of enzyme endonuclease which create a nick as \\na result a 5\\' to 3\\' end of single stranded DNA becomes free. \\n(c) This single stranded DNA of the donor cell moves towards the recipient \\ncell through the conjugation tube. The donor DNA moves by its 5\\' end \\ninto the recipient cell. \\n(d) The conjugation is completed after the transfer of single stranded DNA \\ninto the recipient cell. As a result both F+ and P- cells are separated. \\n(e) The single stranded plasmid DNA of donor cell combine with the recipient \\nDNA strand with the help of enzyme ligase. \\n(f) The single stranded DNA of donor and recipient cell synthesize its \\ncomplementary strand and becomes double stranded. Thus the recipient \\nF- strain change into F+ donor strain. . \\nHIGH FREQUENCY RECOMBINATION OR HFR TRANSFER \\nJacob & Wollman (1951) reported, when F+ plasmid of donor reaches to the F\\xad\\nplasmid of recipient cell in the newly formed F+ cell (previously P- recipient cell) this \\nplasmid occur in two stages (i) either it lie independently in the cytoplasm of F+ cell \\n(ii) or it get combined with the bacterial chromosome. This later stage where the F+98 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nfactor combines with the bacterial chromosome is known as episome. The term episome \\nwas used by Lederberg et al. (1952). This type of bacterial cell convert into high, \\nreproductive ability donor or male cell. This process is known as high frequency \\nrecombination or Hfr male. The reproductive ability of Hfr strain is 1000 times more \\nthan of F+ strain. The integration of plasmid DNA with this genophore (F bacterial \\nDNA) can occur in 20 parts. \\nConjugation in HFr male: During conjugation a conjugation tube is formed \\nbetween the Hfr male and F\" recipient cell. After that the donor DNA opens near the \\nF+ factor and become single stranded. Now this single stranded DNA moves slowly \\nfrom the donor cell to the recipient cell. This transfer process is continued until, both \\nthe Hfr and F- cells are separated naturally. After this separation some part of DNA \\nof Hfr strain remain inside the F- recipient cell and get combined with the DNA of \\nrecipient cell as a result new genes are integrated into the recipient F- cell. The \\ncombination of both the DNA results into the formation of a genetic hybrid which is \\npartially diploid. This type of reproduction is found in Salmonella, Pseudomonas, Vibrio \\nand E. coli. \\nSexduction : Jacob Adelberg (1959) reported this process in bacteria. In general \\nin Hfr strains the F+ factor is integrated with the bacterial chromosome but some times \\nthis F+ factor separate from the bacterial chromosomes and becomes fully autonomous \\nand replicate independently. \\nSometimes during separation this F+ factor contains some genes of the bacterial\\' \\nchromosome and now it is called as F+ prime. When this F+ prime cells comes in contact \\nwith the F- recipient cell it transfer some of the genes are taken from the DNA of the \\nprevious bacterial cell. This process is known as sexduction and as a result the recipient \\ncell become partly diploid and the structure is called as merozygote. \\nBacterial \\nDNA \\nConjugation tube \\nA B C \\nF, factor Replication of F. factor \\n...... ·0·:·· .. \\'·:·1 .. :.& .. : .. : .. :. ;~~: .~: .. ;.. ;~;: .::\\';\\'. .:~~Ol.:·;·· .:{~O·~:··;·· \\n.;0.: I:\\' to:;;: .\" ,~ ... : .. :::\\':: ,0,:.\\' :o.::i:: ,~~: :-,::i:: \\'. :\\' ... : •. : ... \\' ....... ;\\'. \\'.: •. :.:. . : .....•... :. . ... :-.. ! ... ;.

Transduction has been reported \\nin E.coli, Proteus, Schizella and Staphylococcus. \\nZinder and Lederberg (1952) initially began their experiments with the objective \\nof discovering whether the E. coli type of genetic exchange also existed in S. hjphimuriulll. \\nThey cultivated two extotrophic strains of S. hjphimuriu11l. The stram A was unable to \\nsynthesize the amino acids, phenylalanine and tryptophan (Phe-, Try-) but could \\nsynthesize methionine and Histidine (Phe-Try-Met+ His+). The other strain was unable \\nto synthesize methionine and histidine but able to synthesize phenylalanine and \\ntryptophan (Phe+ Try+ Mer His\"). Crossing or combine culturing of strain A and strain \\nB resulted in a wild type prototroph which could synthesize all four amino acids. (Phe + \\nTry+ Met+ His+). Each auxotrophic strain, A and B was placed in both the arms of Davis \\nU-tube. The two arms of tube were separated by a sintered glass filter which was \\nimpervious to bacterial cells but allowed the free passage of nutrient media and other \\nmolecules particles smaller than D.11l. The culture medium was made to pass through \\nthe filter from one arm to the other by alternating suction and pressure. Thus the two \\nauxotrophic strain although physically separate were grown in the same medium. \\nA large number of prototroph appeared in the experiment. Thus it was concluded \\nthat these protrotrophs are obtained by the method other than conjugation. Because this \\nprocess was resistant to DNA enzyme activity, transformation process can\\'t bt: involved \\nin the synthesis of these prototroph. Thus the production of prototrophic Salmonella strain100 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nis due to the activity of certain filterable agent which was later called as Bacteriophage \\nP22. The transducing frequency is low and our only one in 105 to 107 cells undergo \\ntransduction. \\n~ Hershey and Chase (1952) at the same time discovered bacteriophage and explained \\nthat during the infection of bacteria by bacteriophage there is a transfer of nucleic acid \\nof bacteriophage into the bacterial cell. \\nTransduction is generally of two types: \\n1. Generalized transduction \\n2. Specialized transduction. \\n1. Generalized Transduction : It is completed in following steps: \\n(1) This type of transduction starts with the infection of bacteria with the \\nbacteriophage. This process is controlled by the DNA segments called as \\nprophage particle present in the cytoplasm of bacterial cell. \\n(2) During the infection of the lysosgenic bacterial cell by bacteriophage, the DNA \\nof the bacteria breaks down into small fragments and the nucleic acid of the \\nbacteriophage utilizes the bacterial enzymes and synthesize new phage \\ncomponents. \\n(3) At the same time when these progeny phage particles are form the DNA \\nfragments of the bacteria incorporate into these DNA particles of the phage. \\n(4) The genetic material or DNA fragments of the previous bacterial cell is \\ntransferred to the new bacterial cell infected by these progeny phage particles. \\nThus generalized transduction is the process where bacterio phage plays an active \\nrole in the transfer of DNA fragments of the bacterial cell. \\n2. Specialized Transduction: Andre Lwoff et al. (1953) reported that ceitain \\nbacterial strains are able to survive for a long time even after infected by the \\nbacteriophage and these is no lysis of bacterial cell. Here in these bacteria there is a \\njoining of bacterial DNA with the phage DNA and both DNA i.e. bacterial DNA and \\nphage DNA replicate commonly. This bacteria is known as lysogenic bacteria and the \\nphage is called as prophage. \\nThis bacterial celIs can survive in lysogenic stage for many generations which is \\ndue to the synthesis of a special repressor protein. This protein inhibits the synthesis \\nof phage particle inside the bacterial cell. As the synthesis of this protein is stopped \\nthe bacterial cell start the synthesis of phage components. \\nThe DNA of both i.e. of phage DNA and bacterial DNA break~ down before the \\nsynthesis of the phage particles starts. At the same time some bacterial genes are carried \\nout by phage DNA and replicate with the phage DNA. These resultant progeny phage \\nparticles are entirely different from the parent one when these progeny phage particles \\ninfect a new bacterial cell, some of the gene (of the previous bacterial cell) are also \\ntransmitted to the newly infected bacterial cell. In this type of transduction only those \\nspecial genes are transmitted which are attached very closely to the phage DNA.BACfERIA \\nD \\nc pq060 Q O -0«0 9 \\'00 \\nBacteria\\'DNA 1 \\nB \\nViral DNA \\n0) \\n~ViraIDNA \\nT _ Bacteria\\' DNA \\nE \\n1 :cteria, DNA \\nG \\'0 \\nH \\nViral DNA \\nFig. 13 : Transduction in bacteria \\nGram Staining \\n101 \\nOne of the most important and widely used differential staining technique in \\nmicrobiology is called Gram staining. This technique was introduced by Christian Gram \\n(1884). In this process the fixed bacterial smear is subjected to the following staining \\nreagents in the order, crystal violet, iodine solution, alcohol (decolorizing agent), and \\nsafranin. Bacteria stained by the gram method fall into two groups: Gram positive \\nbacteria which retain the crystal violet and hence appear deep violet in color, and gram \\n-ve bacteria which loses the crystal violet and counterstained by safranin and hence \\nappear pink in colour. \\nThe most plausible explanation for this phenomenon are associated with the \\nstructure and composition of the cell wall. The cell wall of gram negative bacteria is \\ngenerally thinner than those of gram positive bacteria. Gram negative bacteria contain \\na· higher percentage of lipid than do Gram p~sitive bacteria. During staining of gram \\nnegative bacteria the alcohol treatment extracts the lipid which results in increased \\nporosity or permeability of the cell wall. Thus the crystal violet -iodine (CV - I) complex102 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\ncan be extracted and the gram negative organism is decolorised. These cells subsequently \\ntake on the color of the safranin counterstain. The cell wall of gram positive bacteria, \\nbecause of their different composition (lower lipid content), become dehydrated during \\ntreatment with alcohol. The pore size decreases, permeability is reduced and the \\nCV-I complex can\\'t be extracted. There for these cells remain purple violet. \\nAnother explanation is also based on permeability differences between the two \\ngroups of bacteria. In gram positive bacteria, the CV-I complex is trapped iD. the wall \\nfollowing the ethanol treatment which presumably causes a diminution in the diameter \\nof the pores in the cell wall peptidoglycan. Walls of gram negative bacteria have a very \\nmuch smaller amount of peptidoglycan, which is less extensively cross-linked than that \\nin the walls of gram positive bacteria. The pores in the peptidoglycan of gram negative \\nbacteria remain sufficiently large even after ethanol treatment to allow the CV-I complex \\nto be extracted. \\nThe two explanations, both contribute to the explanation of the\\'mechanism of the \\ngram stain. Furthermore if gram positive cells are treated with lysozyme (an enzyme) \\nto remove the cell wall, the resulting structure called protoplast will be stained by the \\nCV - I complex. However they are easily decolarized by alcohol. All these evidence \\npoints to the cell structure of gram positive bacteria as the site of retention of the primary \\nstain. \\n(3) Many bacterial species are pathogenic to human beings, animals and plants. \\nThe parasitic bacteria pathogenic to human beings are as follows : \\nDisease Bacteria \\n1.

The \\ndisease produced by these bacteria in plants are as follows :BACTERIA 103 \\n(i) Wilt : Pseudomonas solanaceanml produces wilting in potato, brinjal and many \\ncucurbits. Bacteria causes blocking of vessels in plants resulting in wilting. \\n(ii) Rots : Erwinia, aroideae causes rot disease in potato, raddish, tomato and \\ncauliflower. \\n(iii) Blights : are caused by Erwinia amylovera in apple, pears who destroy the \\nparenchymatous cells. \\n(iv) Crown gall : These are caused by Agrobacteriu11l tllmijaciells and causes \\nhypertrophy in apple etc. \\n(v) Citrus canker: This is caused by XantllOnlOllaS citri in lemon. It produces corky \\ngrowth on the leaf and outer wall of the fruit. \\n(4) Many harmful bacteria are responsible for the reduction of soil fertility or \\ndenitrification. ego Bacillus denitrijicalls, Thiobacilills denitrificalls and Micrococcus dellitrificalls \\nare very harmful to the agriculture because the convert the nitrate, nitrite, ammonia \\nand other compounds in nitrogen into free atmospheric nitrogen. This results in reduction \\nof fertility of soil. These bacteria are known as denitrifying bacteria. The percentage \\nof these bacteria is very less in the soil. \\n(5) Penicillin Destruction: Some bacteria secrete an enzyme penicillinase which \\ndestroys the beneficial antibiotic penicillin. \\n(6) Cotton destruction: A bacterial species Spirochaete cytophage destroys the cotton \\nfibres. \\n(7) Water Pollution: Many aquatic bacteria convert the mercury and its compounds \\ninto highly toxic methyl mercury from the affluent coming out from factories. This \\ncompound is highly toxic to the human beings and it is also neurotoxic in nature. Many \\npathogenic bacteria like Vibrio cholariae, Sclzizella dysellteriae and Salmonella hJPhiae produces \\nand causes many water born diseases in human beings like cholerea, dysentery, typhoid. \\n000VIRUSES \\nViruses may be generalized to define as \\'very small sized etiological agents of \\ndisease that are capable of passing through filters that retain even bacteria, increase \\nonly in the presence of living cells, and give rise to new strains by mutation\\'. \\nMayer (1886) showed that the juice from the infected plants of tobacco could \\nreproduce the disease if applied to healthy plants. The Russian botanist Dimitri \\nIvanowski (1892), demonstrated that the causal organism of tobacco mosaic could even \\npass through the finest porcelain filter that withholds bacteria. Ivanowski also showed \\nthat this filterate was capable of transmitting the disease to healthy susceptible plants. \\nHe also indicated that these causal organism were even smaller than bacteria. \\nBeijerinck (1898) a Dutch microbiologist, showed that the causal agent or tobacco \\nmosaic could diffuse through an agar membrane and was therefore liquid in nature \\nsuch a liquid causal agent of tobacco mosaic was called by Beijerinck as \"Contagium \\nvivum fluidium\\' or \\'living infection fluid\\'. Bacteriophages (viruses that parasitise \\nbacteria) were discovered by the French scientist D. Herelle (1917) who found that some \\nagent was destroying his cultures of bacilli. \\nSchelsinger (1933) was the first to determine the decomposition of virus. He showed \\nthat a bacteriophage consist of only protein and DNA. \\nBowden (1964) defined viruses as \\'submicroscopic, infective entities that multiply \\nonly intracellularly and are potentially pathogenic. According to Hahon (1964) viruses \\nare \\'bits of infectious heredity in search of a chromosome\\'. \\nSome define viruses as \\'infectious nucleoproteins\\'. The word virus is derived from \\nthe latin language meaning \\'poisonous liquid or \\'poison\\'. \\nIn 1935 Stanley crystallized the virus causing tobacco mosaic disease, and \\ndemonstrated that the crystals retained their infectivity when inoculated into healthyVIRUSES 105 \\nplants Hershey and Chase (1952) studied the T2 bacteriophage and demonstrated that \\n(1) the genetic information is carried in the phage DNA and (2) that infection is the \\nresult of penetration of viral DNA into cells. \\nThe nucleic acid fraction of the virus is the actual infectious agent was first shown \\nby Gierrer and Schramm (1956). Phycophages were first isolated by Schafferman and \\nMorris (1963) from blue green alga LyngbtJa. The phage isolated by them was found \\nto infect Plectono1lema and Phormidiunl also (hence named LPP-1), these are cyanophages. \\nMycophages were first discovered in mushroom (Agaricus bisp0nls) by Sinden in \\n1957. \\nGENERAL CHARACfERS OF VIRUSES \\n(1) They do not occur free in nature but act as obiigate intracellular parasite. \\n(2) They are extreme microscopic structure which can only be seen by electron \\nmicroscope. \\n(3) Mainly the size ranges from 100-2000 millimicron. \\n(4) They can not be filtered by bacterial filters. \\n(5) The genetic material is either DNA or RNA which occurs in the form of single \\nmolecule and can be single or double stranded. \\n(6) A single virus particle is known as virion which lacks functional autonomy. \\n(7) They lack their own enzyme system but interact with the host enzyme system \\nand synthesize new virus particles. Thus they have a .master and slave \\nrelationship. \\n(8) Outer capsid of virus is proteinaceous and harmless and provide cellular \\nspecificity to the virus. \\n(9) They are intracellular obligate parasite and can\\'t be cultured on artificial culture \\nmedia. \\n(10) All animal and plant viruses have a narrow host range while others show a \\nbroad host range. \\n(11) They show replication. \\n(12) They are highly infectious and spread disease very quickly. \\n(13) They show special kind of pathogenecity i.e. they cause disease at particular \\ntemperature. Most of virus become inert at 56-69°C (for 30 minutes) \\n(14) They are haploid. \\n(15) They are uneffected by antibiotics. \\n(16) They show life between 5-9 pH. \\n(17) They remain active for a long time when kept in 50% glycerol solution. \\n(18) The extract of virus become inert at high pressure and high sound frequency. \\n(19) They get precipitated with ethyl alcohol and acetone.106 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(20) They can be inerted by treatment with ultraviolet rays, pyridine, ~rea and \\nhydrogen peroxide. \\n(21) They can be crystallized. \\n(22) They show response toward temperature, radiation and chemical substances. \\n(23) They lack cell wall, nucleus, protoplasm and cell organelles. \\nHow do Virus differ from Bacteria and Mycoplasmas? \\nViruses differ from bacteria and mycoplasmas in : \\n(i) not possessing any cellular organization. \\n(ii) Not growing on inanimate media. \\n(iii) not multiply by binary fission. \\n(iv) Not possessing both DNA and RNA together. \\n(v) Not possessing ribosome. \\n(vi) Not showing any sensitivity to antibiotics. \\n(vii) Showing sensitivity to interferon. \\nNATURE OF VIRUSES \\nThe nature of viruses is still not clear, because it is not easy to define them within \\nthe accepted framework of living or non living organisms. Some virologist regard viruses \\nas animate object (when present inside the host cell) whereas other consider them \\ninanimate (when present outside the host cell). \\nViruses are living because: \\n(i) They show growth and multiplication (only inside the host cell). \\n(ii) They have genetic material i.e. DNA/RNA. \\n(iii) They can direct protein synthesis (though they use host machinery for it). \\n(iv) They show mutation. \\n(v) They can be transmitted from the diseased host to the healthy ones or posses \\nthe ability to infect. \\n(vi) They react to heat, chemicals and radiation and also shows irritability, a \\ncharacter of only living organisms. \\n(vii) They posses genetic continuity and have definite races/strains. \\n(viii) Similarity between nucleoproteins of viruses with the protein and nucleic acid \\nof living organisms. \\nViruses are non-living because: \\n(i) They can be crystallized (Stanley, 1935) \\n(ii) They behave as inert chemicals outside the host cell. \\n(iii) A cell wall or cell membrane of any type is absent in viruses. \\n(iv) They do not show functional autonomy.VIRUSES 107 \\n(v) They do not respire or excrete or they do not show any sign of metabolism \\nexcept reproduction. \\n(vi) They lack any energy producing enzyme system. \\nTherefore the contention that \\'viruses are viruses\\' (Lwoff et al., 1966) and nothing \\nelse \\'stands on the top\\'. According to regressive theory of evolution put forward by \\nLwoff, some primitive microorganism (like bacteria) become endoparasitic on some host \\nand gradually lost synthetic enzymes to become today\\'s viruses. Thus viruses are super \\nparasities. It will thus be seen that viruses do not show all the characteristic of typical \\nliving organisms. They however possess two fundamental characteristic of living systems. \\nFirstly they contain nucleic acid as their genetic material. The nucleic acid contains \\ninstruction for the structure and function of the virus. Secondly they can reproduce \\nthemselves, even if only by using the host cell\\'s synthesis machinery. Because of such \\ncharacters, some virologist consider viruses as a transition stage between living and non \\nliving world. They are living organism with some non living characters. \\nOccurrence \\nThe occurrence of viruses in the cells of bacteria and higher plants and animals \\nis well established. \\nPlant viruses: Most plant viruses have been found in angiosperm (flowering \\nplants). Relatively few viruses are known in gymnosperm, ferns, fungi or algae. Plant \\nviruses are of great economic importance, since they cause plant diseases in a variety \\nof crops. \\nAnimal viruses: Virus diseases are known in a variety of vertebrates including \\nfish, amphibian, birds and mammals. Important virus diseases of humans include \\npoliomyelitis, small pox, rabies, mumps, measles, yellow fever, influenza and encephalitis. \\nBacteriophages: Viruses have been found in practically all groups of bacteria. The \\nhost range is confined within bacterial groups. A bacteriophage may multiply only in \\ncertain strains of E.coli. \\nVIRUSES IN EUKARYOTIC MICROORGANISM \\nVirus like particles have been observed in species of Protozoa, algae and fungi. \\nProtozoa: Viruses or virus like particles have been observed in several protozoa viz., \\nleishmania, Entamoeba histolytica, Plasmodium vivax, P. berghei, Paramecium aurelia, Carclzesill1ll \\npolypinum and Acanthamoeba sp. A virus like particle has been reported in Plasmodium \\nberghei. Its structure is like that of a cytoplasmic Polyhedrosis virus, a dsRNA virus of \\ninsects. \\nAlgae: Virus like particles have been reported in Aulacomonas subnzarina, Chara, \\nCorralina, Oedogonium spp., Uronema gigas. Bacteriophage like virus particles have been \\nfound in Chiorella and have been called chlorellophages. \\nFungi: Killer phenotypes associated with the strains of Saccharomyces cerervisiae \\nand Ustilago maydis have been shown to be virus related. dsDNA viruses have been \\ndetected in cells of Penicillium moulds. dsRNA viruses are widely present in the higher108 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nfungi. The bacilli form particles of Agaricus bisporous is the only fungal virus reported \\nthat contains ssRNA. \\nDEFINITION \\nVirion: A single infective particle of virus is called as virion. It consists of nucleic \\nacid core surrounded by a protein coat or capsid. The capsid with enclosed nucleic acid \\nis called nucleocapsid. \\nViroids: These are the smallest infectious agents causing diseases in host. They \\nconsist solely of a protein free low molecular weight (75,000 - 1,25,000 dalton) with \\n243-360 nucleotides and small fragments of double stranded RNA molecules. They are \\nalso known as naked virus, meta virus or pathogene. \\nEvidence shows that viroids replicate by direct RNA copying in which all components \\nrequired for viroid replication including RNA polymerase are provided by the host. During \\nviroid replication, the circular (+) strand of the viroid is replicated while it acts as a rolling \\ndrum producing multimeric linear strands of (-) RNA. The linear (-) strand then serves \\nas a template for replication of multimeric strand (+) of RNA. The (+) RNA is subsequently \\nprocessed (cleaved) by enzymes that release linear, unit length viroid (+) RNA\\'s which \\ncircularize and produce many copies of the original viroid RNA. \\nViroids apparently interfere with the host metabolism in ways resembling those \\nof viruses but of what way is still unclear. It has been shown that both virus specific \\nRNA\\'s synthesized during infection and viroid RNA in vitro activate a protien kinase \\nenzyme, which in turn activates other cellular enzymes while it impedes the initiation \\nof protein synthesis. As viroid strain that cause mild to severe plant symptoms activate \\nthe protein kinase more than 10 times as much as mild strains, it is possible that \\nactivation of the protein kinase represents the triggering event in viroid pathogenesis \\nand in disease development by the plant. \\nViroids are spreaded from diseased to healthy plants primarily by mechanical \\nmeans, i.e. sap carried through hands or tools during cultural practices while some are \\ntransmitted by pollen and seed. \\nViroids survive in nature outside the host or in dead plant matter for periods of \\ntime from few minutes to few months. They are quiet resistant to high temperature \\nand can\\'t be inactivated in infected plant by Heat treatment. \\nThe control of diseases caused by viroids is based on the use of viroid-free \\npropagating stock, removal and destruction of viroid infected plants and washing of \\nhands or sterlizing of tools after handling viroid infected plants before moving on to \\nhealthy plants. \\nPotato spindle tuber viroid (PSTvd) is the first recognized viroid, which consist \\nof 359 nucleotides under E.M. Purified PSTvd appears as short strands about 40 nm \\nlong and has the thickness of a dsDNA. \\nViroids seem to be associated with cell nuclei particularly the chromatin and \\npossibly with the endomembrane system of the cell. \\nIt was first discovered by Diener (1971) as the causal agent of potato spindle tuber \\ndisease. Other viroid caused disease reported so far are-tomato bunchy top disease,VIRUSES 109 \\nchrysanthemum stunt disease, coconut cadang disease, tomato apical stunt disease, \\nAvocado sunblotch etc. \\nThey undergo replication by using the host enzyme system. Their transmission is \\nthrough the cromatin material of host cell. \\nVirusoides: It has been introduced by Rendle et al (1981). \"Virusoides are the \\nviroides which require RNA of the supportive virus for replication\". \\nAt present it has been reported only in Australia with few examples of its host. \\nviz. one virusoide is reported along with velvet tobacco mosaic virus. Other virusoides \\nare attached as satellite along with other virus RNA. \\nThese virusoides undergo replication with the help of RNA of the helper virus \\ninside the host cell. \\nPrions: Haig and Claske (1966) discovered a subviral infectious agent which was \\nlater called as prions by Prusiner et al. Later Prof. Prusiner has been awarded nobel \\nPrize (1997) for medicine for the discovery of prions. \\nThese prions are the causal agent of scrapie disease (a degenerative disorder of \\ncentral nervous system) of sheep and goat. These prions have no nucleic acid (DNAj \\nRNA) but they are made up of only 2-3 molecules of protein only. \\nPrions are 100 times shorter than viruses and are heterogenous in nature. A single \\nprion rod is made up of about 1000 prion molecules. It is 100-200 nm long and 10-\\n20 nm in diameter. Other disease caused by prions are Parkinson\\'s disease, multiple \\nsclerosis, Gerstmann Stransslar syndrome and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. \\nSIZE AND STRUCTURE OF VIRUSES \\nThe size of viruses is variable. Most viruses are much smaller than bacteria. Their \\nsize ranges from 10 nm - 250 nm. The size of viruses is determined by electron \\nmicroscopy, ultra centrifugation and by filtration through colloid ion membrane of known \\npore diameter. \\nThe smallest virus is coliphage F2 measuring about 2 nm. \\nThe smallest plant virus is satellite tobacco necrosis virus measuring 17nm. \\nThe longest known plant virus is citrus tristeza virus-rod shaped measuring \\n2000 x 12 nm. \\nFoot and mouth virus of cattle is the smallest animal virus measuring about \\n10 nm. \\nPox viruses are the largest and most complex animal viruses. \\nParrot fever virus measuring 400 nm. \\nStructure of Viruses \\nThe intact virus unit or infectious particle is called the virion. Each virion consists \\nof a nucleic acid core surrounded by a protein coat (capsid) to form the nucleocapsid. \\nThe nucleocapsid may be naked or may be surrounded by a loose membranous envelope. \\nIt is composed of a number of subunits called capsomeres. The capsid protects the nucleic \\nacid core against the action of nucleases. Structurally viruses occur in three main shapes \\nviz. spherical or polyhedral, cylindrical or helical and the complex type.110 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nV;ruses occur In \\'i ma;n shapes \\nSpherical or \\nPOI[hedral \\nCylindrical \\nor h lical \\nNaked capsids \\neg.-Poliovirus, \\nAdenovirus, \\nPapilloma virus \\nEnveloped \\ncapsids eg.\\xad\\nHerpes simplex \\nvirus \\nNaked capsids e.g \\nBacteriophage \\nM13, TMV \\n(I) POLYHEDRAL (ICOSAHEDRAL) SYMMETRY \\nComplex \\nNo clearly identifiable \\ncapsid e.g.-vaccinia virus \\ncapsids to which other \\nstructures are attached \\ne.g.-some bacteriophage \\nEnveloped \\ncapsids ego \\nInfluenza virus \\nCrick & Watson have shown that the polyhedral capsids can nave three possible \\ntypes of symmetry viz.

In icosahedral symmetry a large number of intermolecular \\nbonds can be formed in this type of structure and is therefore has low free energy. \\nAn icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 faces formed by equilateral triangles \\nand 12 intersecting points or corners. \\nEach capsid consist of many capsomeres. Each capsomere is composed of a few \\nmonomers which form polygonal rings, each with a central space of up to 40 AO. The \\nmonomers are the structural units and are made up of one or more polypeptide chains. \\nThere are two types of capsomeres : \\n(i) Pentamers or pentagonal capsomere is made up of 5 monomers. \\n(ii) Hexamers or hexagonal capsomere consist of 6 monomers. \\nNo. of Capsomeres \\n12 \\n32 \\n72 \\n92 \\n162 \\n252 \\n812 \\nTABLE 1 \\nExample \\n¢ x 174 \\nTurnip yellow mosaic virus & poliovirus \\nPolyoma virus, Papilloma virus \\nReovirus \\nHerpes virus \\nAdenovirus \\nTipula irridescent virusVIRUSES 111 \\nThe monomers are held tog~ther by bonds, each monomers having bonds with two \\nneighbouring monomers.

The monomers curve into a helix because they are thicker at one end than the \\nother. Helical capsids may be naked (e.g. the tobacco mosaic virus) or surrounded by \\nan envelope (e.g. influenza virus). \\nTobacco Mosaic Virus \\nVirus is rod shaped about 300 nm x 15-18 nm in diameter. X-ray diffraction studies \\nhave shown that the virus consists of a protein tube with a lumen of 20 A 0 enclosing \\na single strand of helically coiled RNA. The tube is made up of a number of identical \\nsub units (monomers) of proteins arranged in a helical manner. Studies by Franklin and \\nher co-workers have shown that there are 49 subunits of protein for three turns of the \\nhelix, thus giving a total of 2,130 subunits for the rod. Each subunit has a molecular \\nweight of 17, 500 and consist of single poly chain made up of 158 amino acids.TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe RNA is a single stranded moleculer coiled into a helix 80Ao in diameter. It \\nfollows the pitch of the protein helix. Each tum of RNA helix contains about 49 \\nnucleotides with a pitch of 23°. \\n(III) COMPLEX SYMMETRY \\nComplex viruses are divided into two groups: \\n(a) Those without identifiable capsids. \\n(b) Those with capsids to which are attached additional structures. \\nVaccinia virus is an example of a virus without a definite capsid. The nucleic acid \\nis surrounded by several coats. \\nBacteriophages are the virus that infect bacteria, was discovered independently by \\nFrederick. Twort in England 1915 and by Felix d\\' Herelle at the Pasteur Institute in \\nParis in 1917. D\\'Herelle noted that something was dissolving or lysing their bacterial \\ncultures of Staphylococci and this lytic effect could be transmitted from colony to colony. \\nEven high dilution of material from a lysed colony that had been passed through a \\nbacterial filter could transmit the lytic effect. However heating the filterate destroyed \\nits lytic properties. And this lytic phenomenon is commonly called as Twort-d\\'Herelle \\nphenomenon. \\nIn nature \\'Phages\\' occur commonly in close association with bacteria. They play \\nan important role in the transmission of genetic information between bacteria by \\ntransduction process. Bacteriophages provide the only convenient model to study the \\nvirus-host interaction at cellular and molecular levels. \\nAll most every group of bacteria is attacked by one or other phage. But E.coli has \\nbeen studied most extensively from this point of view. Bacteriophage attacking E.coli \\nare called coliphages and are designated T type. These were numbered Tl, T2, T3 ...•.... Tl7 \\nby Max Delbruck (1938). The best known and most thoroughly studied are T2, T4, T6 \\nwhich are collectively called T -even phages. T 3\\' T s are called T -odd phages. \\nThere are two main types of bacterial viruses, lytic or virulent and temperate or \\navirulent. When lytic phages infect cells, the cells respond by producing large number \\nof new viruses. That is at the end of the incubation period the host cell bursts or lyses, \\nreleasing new phages to infect other host cells. This is called a lytic cycle. In the temperate \\ntype of infection, the result is not so readily apparent. The viral nucleic acid is carried \\nand replicated in the host bacterial cells from one generation to another without any \\ncell lysis. \\nBacterial viruses may be grouped into six morphological types: \\nA = This is most complex type has a hexagonal head, a rigid tail with a contractile \\nsheath and tail fibers. e.g. T 2\\' T 4\\' T 6 (T -even). \\nB = Similar to A, this type has a hexagonal head. However it lacks a contractile \\nsheath, its tail is flexible and it mayor may not have tail fibers. ego Coliphages \\nlike Tl and Ts. \\nC = This type is characterized by a hexagonal head and a tail shorter than the \\nhead. The tail has no contractile sheath and mayor may not have tail fibers. \\nego Coliphage T 3 and T TVIRUSES 113 \\nD = This type has a head made up of large capsomeres, but has no tail ego \\nColiphages, <I> x 174, 513, \\nE = This type of head made up of small capsomeres but has no tail ego Coliphages \\nF2, M5 2· \\nF = This type is filamentous. ego Coliphages Fd, FI. \\nG = Pleomorphic, no detectable capsid, envelope contain lipid ego MV - L2. \\nType A,B,C show morphology unique to bacteriophages. The morphological types \\nin groups D and E are found in plant and animal (including insect) virus. The filamentous \\nform of group F is found in some plant viruses. \\nBacteriophages of the T-even Series (T2\\' T 4, T 6) \\nIt is an example of complex viruses with capsids and attached structures. T4 \\nbacteriophage is tadpole shaped, with head and tail regions. Head capsid is 95 x 65 \\nnm and has the form of a prolate icosahedron. It is made up of about 2,000 similar \\nsubunits and is packed with circular double stranded DNA (500 nm long). Head capsid \\nconsist of two 10-faceted equatorial bands with a pyramidal vertex at either end. The \\ntail has helical symmetry. Thus the bacteriophage shows a combination of icosahedral \\nsymmetry and helical symmetry (binal symmetry). \\nThe tail consist of a core tube 80A o in diameter, through which DNA passes out \\nsurrounded by a protein tail sheath. The sheath consists of 144 subunits arranged in \\n24 rings of 6 subunits each. The sheath is connected to a thin disc, called the collar \\nat the upper end and a base plate at the lower end. The base plate is hexagonal and \\nhas a pen or spike at each corner. From each of the six corners is also given off a long, \\nthin tail fibre. 1300A 0 long, which serves for the attachment of the bacteriophage to \\nthe host cell. \\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION \\nThe intact virus unit or infectious particle is called the virion. Each virion consist \\nof a nucleic acid core surrounded by a protein coat (capsid) to form the nucleocapsid. \\nSome icosahedral and helical animal viruses, plant viruses and bacteriophage are \\nsurrounded by a membranous envelope 100-150 AO thick. \\nThe envelop resembles the typical biological membrane in consisting of a \\nphospholipids bilayer in which are embedded proteins. It has spikes which are composed \\nof glycoproteins. Viral envelop contain host cell protein as well as protein specified by \\nthe virus. Carbohydrate in enveloped virus are only found as glycoproteins but also \\nas glycolipids. Lipid in virus envelop are derived from the host cell. This is shown by \\nthe fact that (i) virus rarely have lipids not found in host cells. (ii) when viruses are \\ngrown in different host cells they show differences in their lipid pattern (iii) Radioactively \\nlabelled cellular lipids are incorporated intavirions. The different lipid are phospholipid, \\ncholesterol, fatty acid etc.114 \\n~\"\"\"\"\" \" \\'1 \\n: I \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I \\n• J \\n...... \"II \\nlilt, ... \" \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I I I \\nI I \\n• I \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I \\nI I \\nIi \\n: I \\nI\\' \\nI\\' • • I I I I \\nI I \\nI I \\n• I I\\' \\n• I I I \\nI I \\n• I \\nA \\n,\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'\\' ... \\nttl\\' ....... \\nI I I I I I I I \\nI I \\n\"\\'... \",~ t.f I. \\n• I • • • • • • : . • I \\nI \\n: \\nI \\nI \\n• I I I \\nI\\' \\nB \\n,-. \" ...... \\n\" \"\\'\" \\n• I • I I • \\n• • I I \\n\\'... ,J \\n\"\", .. f\\'\" \\ni : : \\nI \\nf • I \\nI \\nI \\nI \\nII I I .. \\nI \\nc \\n..... . . ... ., . \\nJ : \\n•. . ... ..... \\no \\n..... ,.\\' \", I I I I \\nI I \\n\\'. ..\\' ...... fI\\' \\nE \\nTEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nF \\nG \\nFig. 2 Structure of T4 bacteriophage and structure of various \\nmorphological forms of Bacterial virusesVIRUSES 115 \\nVIRAL GENOME \\nIt contains all genetic information.

They do not show any metabolic activity except \\n(multiplication) self-duplication that too only within the host cytoplasm. Viruses require \\nspecific host cells for their multiplication. \\nTwo different types of life cycles are exhibited by bacteriophage, virulent or lytic \\ncycle and temperate or lysogenic cycle. In the former the intracellular phage multiplication \\nresults in the lyses or disintegration of the cell of the host bacterium and then final \\nrelease of the progeny virions. In later no harm is caused to the cell of the host bacterium \\nand the nucleic acid of the virus is first inserted in the bacterial (host) DNA and then \\nreplicates along with bacterial DNA. Bacteria containing prophages are called lysogenic \\nbacteria and those viruses whose nucleic acid can become prophage (i.e. gets incorporated \\nin bacterial DNA) are known as lysogenic, temperate or avirulent phages (eg. F2, M 12). \\nLytic or Virulent Cycle \\nThe major events involved in the lytic cycle of T -even phages are: \\n(1) Attachment of phage particle to the host. \\n(2) Adsorption of virus particle. \\n(3) Penetration into the host. \\n(4) Replication of viral nucleic acid. \\n(5) Protein synthesis. \\n(6) Assembly of new virions. \\n(7) Release of mature viruses \\n(1) Attachment to the host: Random collision brings the phage particles in contact \\nwith the bacterial cells.

All the \\nactivities before pining are reversible.VIRUSES 121 \\nAfter pinning the tail sheath contracts and therefore, appears shorter and thicker \\n(C). Sheath contracts by rearrangement of discs from 24 to 12. The phage uses its energy \\nin tail contraction as ATP. The activity of phage contraction is comparable to that of \\nmicrosyringe (D). The base plate through the centre enlarges after contraction of sheath. \\nAfter making the contact with a component of plasma membrane, unplugging of phage \\nDNA begins (E). Thereafter, DNA is injected into the cell without requiring metabolic \\nenergy. (F) Phage head and tail remain outside the cell. Such empty protein coats are \\nknown as \\'ghosts\\'. \\nThe adsorption of the virus particles is a specific process for which the presence \\nof some cations is necessary. Both cells and virus particles are negatively charged at \\npH 7 and positive ions are therefore required as counter ions.

Actually it is like an injection through a syringe. \\nThe end plate and the tail fibres are held firmly against the bacterial cell. It causes \\nthe hollow core of the phage tail to pierce through the bacterial cell wall and possibly \\nthe plasma membrane. At this stage the contractile tail sheath functions like a muscle. \\nIt derives the energy from ATP present in the tail of the phage. Through the hollow \\ncore of the contracted tail the phage DNA is injected or penetrated into the body of \\nthe bacterium. Lysozyme, present on the phage tail, may also facilitate the DNA \\npenetration by producing a hole on the bacterial wall. After the completion of the \\npenetration process. The empty head and the tail of the phage remain outside the \\nbacterium as the empty shell. Such empty shells are called ghosts. \\n(4) Replication of viral nucleic acids: Successful penetration of DNA will result \\nin the production of its many replicas. Enzyme are also involved in the replication of \\nnucleic acid. This replication in the double stranded DNA viruses occur in the nuclear \\nmaterial of the host cell, so does the transcription. Replication process causes several \\nchanges in the metabolism of the host cell. \\n(5) Protein synthesis: The phage nucleic acid, once inside the bacterial cell, takes \\nover the protein synthesis machinery of the cell. It suppresses the synthesis of bacterial \\nprotein and directs the metabolism of the cell to synthesize the proteins of the phage \\nparticle. This is accomplished by the synthesis of viral specific m-RNA. The replication \\nof phage DNA follows the semi conservative mechanism. Most of the phage DNA serves \\nas a template in its own synthesis and the rest is used as a template for the synthesis \\nof viral specific m-RNA. The later directs the host cell to synthesize proteins which are \\nused as a subunits (capsomeres) of the protein coat of the phage particle. These protein \\nare called late proteins as mentioned above. After the penetration of phage DNA some \\nenzyme are first synthesized. These enzymes are necessary for building complex \\nmolecule peculiar to the phage, and represent early proteins. Subsequently, late proteins \\nappear, which include the protein subunits of head and tail of the bacteriophage.122 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(6) Assembly of new virions: The DNA of phage and proteins of its head and \\ntail are synthesize separately in the bacterial cell. The phage DNA is condensed into \\na compact polyhedron and packaged into the head. Finally the tail structures are added \\nand thus new virion is assembled. The process of assembly of different components \\nof the phage into the new mature virions is called \\'maturation\\' process on \\'morphogenesis \\nprocess\\'. \\n(7) Release of mature viruses: It is the final step of infection cycle. The entire \\ncycle of phage development is completed in 30-90 min. In an infected bacterium 7-\\n8 phage particles are formed/minute and a total of about 200 phages are formed in \\na bacterium. During the process of phage replication the bacterial cell wall is weakend. \\nIt is facilitated by the enzyme lysozyme, secreted by the phage DNA in the host cell. \\nThis enzyme causes the lysis or bursting of cell wall. Such a disintegration or lysis \\nof cell wall releases the mature daughter phages.

The interferon first marketed under \\nthe trade name was \\'Intron\\'. \\n000BACTERIAL VIRUSES \\nViruses that use bacterial cells as hosts are called bacteriophages. There is hardly \\na single species of bacteria where sufficient investigation has not found a phage. The \\npresence of bacteriophage is recognized by the appearance of \\'plaques\\' or lytic holes in \\na continuous bacterial lawn. Phage nucliec acid occurs either as double or single stranded \\nnucleic DNA or as a double or single stranded RNA. \\nFILAMENTOUS SINGLE-STRANDED DNA BACI\\'ERIAL VIRUSES \\nThe filamentous DNA phages, which have helical rather than icosahedral symmetry, \\nthe most studied member of this group is phage M13, which infects Escherichia coli, but \\nrelated phages include f1 and fd. As with the small RNA bacteriophages, these filamentous \\nDNA phages infect only conjugational donor cells, entering after attachment to the pilus. \\nEven though these phages are linear (filamentous) in shape, like ell X174 they possess \\ncircular single-stranded DNA. \\nPhage M13 \\nPhage M13 is the model filamentous bacteriophages. The phage has found extensive \\nuse as a cloning vector and DNA-sequencing vehicle in genetic engineering. The virion \\nof phage M13 is only 6 nm in diameter but is 860 nm long. These filamentous DNA phages \\nhave the additional interesting property of being released from the cell without lysing \\nthe host cell. Thus, a cell infected with phage M13 can continue to grow, all the while \\nreleasing virions. Virus infection causes a slowing of cell growth, but otherwise a cell \\nis able to coexist with its virus. Typical plaques are thus not observed; instead, only areas \\nof reduced turbidity occur within a bacterial lawn. \\nMany aspects of DNA replication in filamentous phages are similar to those of <l> X174. \\nThe property of release without cell killing occurs by budding. In this mechanism, theBACTERIAL VIRUSES 125 \\nend of the virion containing several copies of a protein known as the A-protein is released \\nfirst, with the remainder of the virion. With phage M13 there is no accumulation of \\nintracellular virions as with typical bacteriophages. Instead, the assembly of mature M13 \\nvirions occurs on the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane and virus assembly is \\ncoupled with the budding process. \\nSeveral features of phage M13 make it useful as a cloning and DNA sequencing \\nvehicle. First, it has single-stranded DNA, which means that sequencing can easily be \\ncarried out by the Sanger dideoxynucleotide method. Second, a double-stranded form of \\ngenomic DNA essential for cloning purposes is produced naturally when the phage \\nproduces the replicative form. Third, as long as infected cells are kept in the growing \\nstate, they can be maintained indefinitely with cloned DNA, so a continuous source of \\nthe cloned DNA is available. And finally, like phage lambda, there is an intergenic space \\nin the genome of phage M13 that does not encode proteins and can be replaced by variable \\namounts of foreign DNA. For these and other reasons, phage M13 is an important part \\nof the biotechnologist\\'s toolbox. \\nBACTERIAL VIRUS T4 \\nThe first viruses to be studied in any detail were a number of bacteriophages with \\nlinear, double-stranded DNA genomes that infect Escherichia coli and a number of related \\nBacteria. Virologists began isolating and studying these viruses as model systems for \\nvirus replication and used them to establish many of the fundamental principles of \\nmolecular biology and genetics. These phages were given designations of Tl, T2 and so \\non upto TT \\nBacteriophages T2, T4, and T6 are closely related viruses, but T4 is the most \\nextensively studied. The virion of phage T4 is structurally complex. It consists of an \\nelongated icosahedral head whose overall dimensions are 85 x 110 nm. To this head is \\nattached a complex tail consisting of a helical tube (25 x 110 nm) to which are connected \\na sheath, a connecting \"neck\" with \"collar\", and a complex end plate, to which are \\nattached long, jointed tail fibers. Altogether, the virus contain over 25 distinct types of \\nstructural proteins. \\nThe length of DNA contained in these bacteriophages is only about 6% that contained \\nin E.coli. The bacteriophages has enough DNA for over 100 genes. The genome of T4 is \\na double-stranded linear DNA molecule of 168,903 base pairs. The T4 genome encodes \\nover 250 different proteins, and although no known virus encodes its own translational \\napparatus, T4 does encode several of its own tRNAs . While the T4 genome has a unique \\nlinear sequence, the genome in one virion may not be exactly the same as that of another. \\nThis is because the DNA of phage T4 is circularly permuted. Molecules that are circularly \\npermuted appear to have been linearized by opening a circle, but at different locations. \\nIn addition to circular permutation, the DNA in each T4 virion has repeated sequences \\nat each end called terminal repeats of about 3-6 kbp. Both of these factors affect genome \\npackaging. \\nThe terminally redundant T4 DNA infecting a single host cell is first replicated as \\na unit, and then several genomic units are recombined end-to-end to form a long DNA126 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nmolecule called a concatemer. The packaging mechanism of T4 DNA involves cutting a \\nsegment of DNA from the concatemer sufficient to fill a phage head (at least one genomic \\nequivalent) rather than cutting the DNA at a specific sequence. Since the T4 head holds \\nslightly more than a genome length, this \\'headful mechanism\\' leads to circular permutation \\nand terminal redundancy. T4 DNA contains the modified base 5-hydroxymethy1cystosine \\ninstead of cytosine. It is these residues that are glucosylated and DNA with this \\nmodification is resistant to virtually all known restriction enzymes. Consequently, the \\nincoming T4 DNA is well protected from host defenses. The multiplication cycle of these \\nphages like that all viruses (as mentioned in chap 9) can be divided into five distinct \\nstages viz. attachment, penetration, biosynthesis, maturation and release. \\nMultiplication in T4 Phage \\nThings happen rapidly in a T4 infection. \\nEarly in infection T4 directs the synthesis of its \\nown RNA and also begins to replicate its unique \\nDNA. About 1 minute after attachment and \\npenetration of the host by T4 DNA, the synthesis \\nof host DNA and RNA ceases, while transcription \\nof specific phage genes begins. Translation of \\nviral mRNA begins soon after, and within 4 \\nminutes of infection, phage DNA replication has , . \\nbegun. \\nThe T4 genome can be divided into three \\nparts, encoding early proteins, middle proteins, \\nand late proteins, respectively. The early and \\nmiddle proteins are primarily enzymes involved \\nin DNA replication and transcription, while the \\nlate proteins are the head and tail proteins and \\nthe enzymes involved in liberating the mature \\nphage particles from the cell. \\nAlthough T4 has a very large genome for a \\nvirus, it does not encode its own RNA polymerase. \\nThe control of T4 mRNA synthesis involves the \\n65 nm \\nFig. 1 : T-even bacteriophage \\nproduction of proteins that sequentially modify the specificity of the host RNA polymerase \\nso that it recognizes phage promoters. The early promoters are read directly by the host \\nRNA polymerase and involve the function of host sigma factor. Host transcription is shut \\ndown shortly thereafter by a phage encoded anti-sigma factor that binds to host CJ70 and \\ninterferes with its recognition of host promoters. \\nPhage-specific proteins synthesized from the early genes also carry out covalent \\nmodifications on the host RNA polymerase (l subunits and a few phage-encoded proteins \\nalso bind to the polymerase. These modifications change the specificity of the polymerase \\nso that it now recognizes T4 middle promoters. One of the T4 early proteins, called MotA, \\nrecognizes a particular DNA sequence in middle promoters and guides RNA polymeraseBACTERIAL VIRUSES 127 \\nto these sites. Transcription from the late promoters requires a new T4- encoded sigma \\nfactor. Sequential modification of host cell RNA polymerase as described here for phage \\nT4 is used to regulate gene expression by many other bacteriophages as well. \\nT4 encodes over 20 new proteins that are synthesized early aft.er infection. These \\ninclude enzymes for the synthesis of the unusual base 5-hydroxymethykytosine and for \\nits glucoslyation, as well as an enzyme that degrades the normal DNA precursor \\ndeoxycytidine triphosphate. In addition, T4 encodes a number of enzymes that have \\nfunctions similar to those of host enzymes in DNA replication but that are formed in larger \\namounts, thus permitting faster synthesis of T4 specific DNA. Additional early proteins \\ninclude those involved in the processing of newly replicated phage DNA. \\nMost of the late genes encode structural proteins for the virion, including those for \\nthe head and tail. Assembly of heads and tails occurs independently; DNA is packaged \\ninto the assembled head and the tail and tail fibers are added later. Exit of the virus from \\nthe cell occurs as a result of cell lysis. The phage codes for a lytic enzyme, T4 lysozyme, \\nwhich attacks the peptidoglycan of the host cell. After a lytic cycle, which takes only about \\n25 min, over 100 new virions will be released from each host cell, which itself has now \\nbeen almost completely destroyed. The various stages involved in the multiplication of \\nphages can be demonstrated experimentally in what is known as a one-step growth \\nexperiment. In this procedure, a phage suspension is diluted until a sample containing \\nonly a few phage particles is obtained. These particles are then introduced into a culture \\nof host cells. Periodically samples of phage particles are removed from the culture are \\ninoculated into a plate culture of susceptible host cells, the plaque method is used to \\ndetermine the number of infective phage particles on this culture. A few minutes after \\nattachment no infective particles are present. However phage nucleic acid is found inside \\nthe infected cells and capsid proteins will be synthesized. The time required for maturation \\nis the interval between the appearance of phage nucleic acid and the synthesiS of mature \\nphages. After few minutes the number of infective phage particles found in sub cultures \\nbegins to rise. The burst size is determined once the number of infective phage particles \\nremains constant indicating that no further phage multiplication will occur. \\nTEMPERATE BACTERIOPHAGES \\nBacteriophages T4 is virulent. However, some other viruses, although also able to \\nkill cells through a lytic cycle, have the option of undergoing a different life cycle resulting \\nin a stable genetic relationship with the host. Such viruses are called temperate viruses. \\nThese viruses can enter into a state called lyosgeny, where most virus genes are not \\nexpressed and the virus genome, called a prophage, is replicated in synchrony with the \\nhost chromosome. \\nThe temperate phage genome can be replicated along with that of the host and during \\ncell division be passed from one generation to the next. Under certain conditions cells that \\nharbor a temperate virus, called lysogens, can spontaneously produce and release virions. \\nLysogeny is probably of ecological importance because most bacteria isolated from \\nnature are lysogens for one or more bacteriophages. Lysogeny can also confer new genetic \\nproperties on the bacterial cell. \\nIn a typical lytic virus it is not the presence (or even the replication) of viral DNA128 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nthat leads to the production of new virions and host cell death. Rather it is expression \\nof the viral genome that is deleterious. Host cells can harbor viral genomes without harm \\nif the expression of the viral genes can be controlled. This is the situation found in \\nlysogens. However, if this control is lost, the virus enters the lytic pathway and produces \\nnew virions, eventually lysing the host cell. Lysogeny can thus be considered a genetic \\ntrait of a bacterial strain. \\nThe temperate virus does not exist in its extracellular form inside of the cell. Instead, \\nthe prophage is integrated into the bacterial chromosome and replicates along with the \\nhost cell as long as the genes controlling its lytic pathway are not expressed. Typically \\nthis control is maintained by a phage-encoded repressor protein (the gene encoding the \\nrepressor protein is expressed). The virus repressor protein not only controls the lytic genes \\non the prophage but also prevents the expression of any incoming genes of the same virus. \\nThis results in the lysogens having immunity to infection by the same type of virus. \\nIf the phage repressor is inactivated or if its synthesis is prevented, the prophage \\nis induced. Induction results in the production of new virions and the lysis of the host \\ncell. In some cases, induction can be brought about by environmental conditions. If the \\nvirus loses the ability to leave the host genome (because of mutation), it becomes a cryptic \\nvirus. Genomic studies have shown that many bacterial chromosomes contain DNA \\nsequences that were clearly once part of a viral genome. Thus the establishment and \\nbreakdown of the lysogenic state is likely a dynamic process in prokaryotes. \\nBACTERIOPHAGE LAMBDA OR A. PHAGE \\nOne of the best-studied temperate phages is lambda, which infects Escherichia coli. \\nMorphologically, lambda virions look like those of many other tailed bacteriophages\" \\nalthough unlike phage T4, no tail fibers are present. The genome of lambda consists of \\na linear double-stranded DNA molecule, but at the 5\\' terminus of each of the strands \\nis a single-stranded tail 12 nucleotides long. These single-stranded ends are complementary \\n(the ends of the DNA are said to be cohesive). Thus, when the two\\' ends of the DNA \\nare free in the host cell they associate (the cos site), and the DNA is ligated to form a \\ndouble-stranded circle of 48,502 base pairs. \\nLambda Infection and the Lytic Pathway \\nThe lambda virion attaches to a specific receptor protein in the cell wall of Escherichia \\ncoli and injects its DNA. The DNA circularizes almost immediately and expression of the \\nphage genome begins. The first steps in gene expression are the same whether the final \\nresult is lysis or lysogeny. This replication shows an interesting example of molecular level \\ncontrol of gene expression. The completion of rightward transcription of the phage genome \\nrequires the expression of Q gene expression. The complete counter clock wise transcription \\nof the lambda genome requires the expression of the N gene that codes for an N protein. \\nBoth the N and Q genes must be expressed for the transcription of the complete genome. \\nThe A. phage genome contains a a gene which codes for a repressor protein that binds \\nto the operator that controls the expression of N protein. In the absence of N protein synthesis \\nthe replication of A. phage DNA can\\'t proceed. The repressor protein also binds to another \\noperator region, blocking the rightward transcription of the A. phage DNA and thus theBACTERIAL VIRUSES 129 \\nproduction of Q protein. This leads to a conversion to lysogenic replication. During the \\nlytic replication cycle of A, transcription begins at two promoter sites during early replication \\none of the promoter site initiates rightward transcription Pl\\\\ the other initiates left ward \\ntranscription PL\\' Production of RNA using host RNA polymerase begins at two key \\npromoters called P L (promoter left) and P R (promoter right). These yield short transcripts \\nthat are translated to give the products of the N and the cro genes, both proteins being \\ninvolved in regulatory events. The ero protein regulates whether the lytic or the lysogenic \\npathway is followed. The N protein is an antitenninator that allows that RNA polymerase \\nto transcribe past specific terminators, extending the transcripts from P Land P R\\' These longer \\ntranscripts can be translated to yield more proteins, including the products of the cII and \\ncIII genes. The N protein is not completely effective at the terminator before the Q gene, \\nand so only a small amount of the Q protein is made. \\nLambda \\nvirion \\nFig. 2 : The lambda genome130 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe Q protein is also an antiterminator protein. If its concentration becomes high \\nenough, it will allow the transcript from a nearby promoter to synthesize the transcript \\nlabeled R2. This transcript is translated to yield the late proteins, all the necessary \\nstructural proteins to construct a virion, and the proteins necessary for cell lysis. However, \\nat the same time the Q protein is accumulating, the Cro protein also reaches levels where \\nit can block transcription from both P L and P R by binding to both 0L (operator left) and \\nOR (operator right). Therefore, Cro functions as a repressor protein. \\nIn the mechanism of Cro protein binding to OR is observed that there are three similar \\nbut non identical sites at this operator where the Cro protein can bind. It does so first \\nat site 3, and then site 2, and only when those two sites are filled, at site 1 once P Land \\nonce P R are blocked, no more cII or cIII proteins can be synthesized. These proteins are \\nneeded to enter the lysogenic pathway. Thus, when Cro is made in high amounts, lambda \\nis irreversibly commited to the lytic pathway. \\nThe shut off of P L and P R results in a change of lambda DNA replication. Early DNA \\nsynthesis is bidirectional from a single origin and gives rise to typical theta-like intermediates. \\nHowever, by the time late proteins are being made, long, linear concatamer of DNA are \\nsynthesized by rolling circle replication. In this mechanism and unlike semi conservative \\nreplication, replication proceeds in only one direction and can result in very long chains \\nof replicated DNA. Rolling circle replication permits rapid DNA replication and thus is \\na useful mechanism for rapidly accumulating copies of the lambda genome to package into \\nmature virions. The long concatemers are cut into virus-sized lengths by a DNA-cutting \\nenzyme. In the case of lambda, the cutting enzyme cuts at specific sites on the two strands \\n(the cos sites), 12 nucleotides apart, providing the cohesive ends involved in the cyclization \\nprocess. The linear DNA is then packaged into phage heads and the tails and other proteins \\nadded. The cell is then lysed by the activity of phage-encoded enzym~, and the lambda \\nlytic cycle is complete. In a nutshell, If Cro dominates regulatory events, the outcome is lysis, \\nwhile if the lambda repressor dominates, lysogeny will occur. \\nLysogeny \\nfavored \\nInfection \\nP L activated ..

DNA in E. coli Chromosome \\nIntegration of lambda DNA occurs at a unique site on the Escherichia coli chromosome \\n& is required to complete the lysogenic state. Integration occurs by insertion of the virus \\ngenome into the host genome (thus effectively lengthening the host genome by the length \\nof the virus DNA) upon injection, the cohesive ends of the linear lambda molecule find \\neach other and form a circle, and it is thus circular DNA that becomes integrated into \\nthe host genome (the site created when these ends join is called cos). To establish lysogeny, \\ngenes cI (lambda repressor) and int (encoding integrase) must be expressed. The integration \\nprocess requires lambda integrase, which is a site-specific nuclease/integrase-catalyzing \\nrecombination of the phage and bacterial attachment sites. The int gene has a promoter \\nthat, like P E\\' is activated by the cII protein. \\nBACTERIAL VIRUS T7 \\nBacteriophage T7, a representative T-odd phage, has a small linear double-stranded \\nDNA genome. The DNA is injected linearly into bacterial cells after the phage attaches \\nto a host cell, most commonly E. coli. Transcription of the T7 genome begins immediately \\nafter penetration. Host cell RNA polymerase initiates RNA synthesis at closely spaced \\npromoters of the phage DNA end. Host RNA polymerase is used to copy the first few \\nphage genes, called early genes. It also makes mRNA for the phage-specific RNA \\npolymerase that is used in the major RNA transcription process that occurs during \\nreplication of this phage. \\n;§ \\niii iii i i \\n12 13 14 1516 17 18 19 0.30.7 1 1.11.3 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 \\n--------... --------... --------... • • • • • Early mRNAs \\nFig. 4 : Linear genome of T7 bacteriophage \\nTranscription generates a set of overlapping polygenic mRNA molecules. These \\nmRNA molecules are then cut by a host-specified RNaseIII that acts at several sites. This \\ngenerates smaller mRNA molecules that code for one to four proteins each. One of these \\nproteins is an RNA polymerase that copies double-stranded DNA. Two others code for \\nproteins that stop host RNA polymerase action. This turns off early gene transcription \\nand translation of host genes.132 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe T7 phage strongly affects host transcription and translation processes by \\nproducing proteins that tum off transcription of host genes. This phage has genes co~ling \\nfor enzymes that degrade host cell DNA. Nucleotides from degraded DNA are incorporated \\ninto phage progeny. Late genes expressed, beginning 6 minutes after infection, code for \\nenzymes involved in DNA replication. Regulation of T7 gene expression is both positive \\nand negative. Negative control is by means of the formation of proteins that stop host \\nRNA polymerase and shut off early T7 gene transcription. Positive control is by the \\nformation of new RNA polymerase that recognizes the rest of the T7 promoters. \\nA structural feature of T7 DNA that is important for its replication is a direct terminal \\nrepeat of 160 bp at both ends of the molecule. To replicate DNA near the 5\\' terminus, \\nRNA primer molecules have to be removed before replication is complete. There is thus \\nan unreplicated portion of the T7 DNA at the 5\\' -terminus of each strand. Genetic elements \\ncomposed of linear DNA employ various strategies for solving this problem in DNA \\nreplication. The strategy employed by T7 is similar to that used by T4 and involves the \\nrepeated sequence at its ends. The opposite single 3\\' -strands on two separate DNA \\nmolecules, being complementary, can pair with these 5\\' -strands, forming a DNA molecule \\ntwice as long as the original T7 DNA. The unreplicated portions of this structure are \\nthen completed through the activity of T7 DNA polymerase and ligase, resulting in a linear \\nbirnolecule called a concatemer. \\nContinued replication & recombination can lead to concatemers of considerable \\nlength, but ultimately a phage-encoded endonuclease cuts each concatemer at a specific \\nsite, resulting in the formation of virus-sized linear DNA molecules with terminal repeats. \\nBecause T7, like lambda but unlike T4, cuts the concatemer at specific sequences, the DNA \\nsequence in each T7 virion is identical. This is not the case in phage T4. This phage \\nprocesses DNA using a \\'headful mechanism\\', which means that its DNA is not only \\nterminally redundant but is also circularly permuted. \\nMU: A DOUBLE-STRANDED TRANSPOSABLE DNA BACTERIAL VIRUS \\nOne of the more interesting bacteriophages is phage Mu. This virus is temperate, \\nlike lambda, but has the unusual property of replicating as a transposable element. This \\nphage is called Mu because term Mu stands for mutator phage inducing mutations in \\na host genome into which it becomes integrated. The mutagenic property of Mu arises \\nbecause the genome of the virus can be inserted within host genes, thus inactivating them. \\nHence, a host cell that has become infected with Mu can assume a mutant phenotype. \\nMu is a useful phage in bacterial genetics because it can be used to easily generate a \\nwide variety of bacterial mutants. The unique property of Mu is that it contact as \\ntransposon within a host cell. Transposable elements are sequences of DNA that can move \\nfrom one location on their host genome to another as discrete genetic units. They are found \\nin both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and play important roles in genetic variation. \\nAlthough a bacteriophage, Mu is in reality a very large transposable element that replicates \\nits DNA by transposition. \\nBacteriophage Mu is a large virus with an icosahedral head, a helical tail, and \\nsix tail fibers. The genome of Mu contains linear double-stranded DNA. It can be seenBACTERIAL VIRUSES 133 \\nthat the bulk of the genes are involved in the synthesis of head and tail proteins and \\nthat important genes at each end of the genome are involved in replication and host \\nrange. \\nThe DNA in Mu is approximately 39 kbp, but only 37.2 kbp constitute the actual \\nMu genome. This is because both ends of the Mu genome contain host DNA. At the left \\nend of the Mu DNA are 50-150 bp of host DNA, and at the right end are 1-2 kbp of \\nhost DNA. These host DNA sequences are not unique but simply represent DNA adjacent \\nto the location where Mu was inserted into the genome of its previous host. \\nWhen a Mu phage virion is formed, a length of DNA containing the Mu genome \\njust large enough to fill the phage head is excised from the host. The DNA is packaged \\nuntil the head is full, but the place at the right end where the DNA is cut varies from \\none virion to another, there is a variable sequence of host DNA at the right-hand end \\nof the phage (right of the attR site). Thus, each virion arising from a single infected cell \\nwill be genetically unique, since it will have different host DNA. \\nA specific segment of the Mu genome called G is invertible, being present in the \\ngenome either in the orientation designated G+ or in the inverted orientation G. The \\norientation of this segment determines the kind of tail fibers that are present on the phage. \\n5ince adsorption to the host cell is controlled by molecular interactions between the tail \\nfibers and the cell surface, the host range of Mu is determined by which orientation of \\nthis invertible segment is present in the phage. For example, if the G segment is in the \\norientation designated G+, then the phage will make tail fibers that allow it to infect \\nEscherichia coli strain K12. By contrast, if the G segment is in the G- orientation, then the \\nphage will infect E. coli strain C or several other species of enteric bacteria. The two tail \\nfiber proteins are encoded on opposite strands within this small G segment. \\nLeft of the G segment is a promoter that directs transcription into the G segment. \\nIn the orientation G+, the promoter directing transcription of genes 5 and V is active, \\nwhereas in the orientation G-, a different promoter directs transcription of genes 5\\' and \\nV\\' on the opposite strand. Inversion of the G region is a rare event and is under the control \\nof a gene adjacent to the G region. We thus see in the inversion phenomenon is a simple \\nmechanism for attacking a variety of different host cells. \\nReplication of Mu \\nOn infection of a host cell by Mu, the DNA is injected and is protected from host \\nrestriction by a modification system in which about 15% of the adenine residues are \\nmodified by acetylation or acetoamidated. Integration requires the activity of the gene A \\nproduct, which is a transposase enzyme encoded by the phage. At the site where the Mu \\nDNA becomes integrated, a 5-bp duplication of host DNA arises at the target site. This \\nhost DNA duplication arises because staggered cuts are made at the point in the host \\ngenome where Mu is inserted. The resulting single-stranded segments are converted to \\nthe double-stranded form as part of the Mu integration process. Duplication of short \\nstretches of host DNA is typical of transposable element insertion. Mu DNA is transposed \\nto multiple site of the bacterial chromosome when Mu integrates its gene around the \\nbacterial chromosome it inserts phage DNA within bacterial genes causing mutation.134 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nPositive activator Invertible G \\nof late mRNA synthesis segment \\nRepressor Lysis H~ad and (host range) \\nIntegration tall genes .L \\nHost Variable r~ePlication .-, __ --\\'1 ___ --..;_-., DNA end \\n\\\\ \\nI (host DNA) \\n~~~ __ ~~IYs ____ ~ ( ~ \\no C / SUU\\'~J D \\nf 7 \\nattL Transposase \\n(a) \\nInsertion point: region \\nto be duplicated \\nattR \\nl I I I \\nAIAGCAGIC \\nTITCGTCIG \\n1 \\ni \\nHost \\n...----..1 DNA \\nStaggered cuts made in \\nhost DNA by transpose \\nGCCG A I Mu I AGCAGICGTT \\nGICAA I ICGGCITITCGTCI \\nG C C GAIAGCAG \\nP G G ClTI TCGTC \\n(b) \\n1 \\nConversion to single \\nstrands and insertion \\nof Mu \\nMu AGCAG ICGTT \\nTCGTclqcAA \\nRepair of DNA leads \\nto formation of five-base\\xad\\npair duplication \\nFig. 5 : Replication of bacteriophages Mu \\nLytic growth of Mu can occur either upon initial infection, if the Mu repressor (the \\nproduct of the c gene) is not formed, or by induction of a lysogen; In either case, replication \\nof Mu DNA involves repeated transposition of Mu to multiple sites on the host genome. \\nInitially, transcription of only the early genes of Mu occurs, but after the C protein is \\nexpressed (C is a positive activator of late transcription), synthesis of the Mu head and \\ntail proteins occurs. Eventually, expression of the lytic function occurs and mature phage \\nparticles are released. The lysogenic state in Mu requires the sufficient accumulation of \\nrepressor protein to prevent transcription of integrated Mu DNA. \\n000PLANT VIRUSES \\nA virus is a nucleoprotein that has the ability to cause disease. It multiplies only \\nin living cells and it is too small to be seen individually with a light microscope. All \\nviruses are parasitic in cells and cause a multitude of diseases in all forms of living \\norganisms from single celled microorganism to large plants and animals. The total number \\nof viruses known to date exceeds 2000 and new virus are described every month. About \\none fourth of all known viruses attack and cause diseases in plants. One virus may infect \\none or dozens of different species of plants and each species of plant is usually attacked \\nby many different kinds of viruses. A single plant may also be infected by more than \\none kind of virus at the same time. \\nAlthough viruses can take any of several forms, they are mostly rod or polyhedral \\nshaped or the variant of these two basic structures. The genetic material is only RNA \\nor only DNA. \\nViruses cause disease not by consuming cells or killing them with toxins, but by \\nutilizing cellular substances during multiplication, taking up space in cells and disrupting \\ncellular processes and lead to the development of abnormal substances and conditions \\ninjurious to the functions and the life of the cell or the organism. \\nMORPHOLOGY \\nMorphologically the plant viruses came in different shapes and sizes. Generally they \\nare elongate rigid rods and other are spherical like isometric or polyhedral and the \\nremaining being cylindrical bacillus like rods. Some elongated viruses are rigid rods about \\n15 x 300 nm, but most appear as long, thin, flexible threads about 10-13 x 480-2000 nm. \\nMost of the spherical viruses are polyhedral 17-60 nm. \\nMany plant viruses have split genomes, consisting of two or more distinct nucleic \\nacid strands encapsidated in different sized particles made of the same protein subunits.136 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMany isometric viruses have two or three different components of the same size but \\ncontaining nucleic acid strands of different length. \\nThe surface of viruses consist of a definite number of protein subunits which are \\nspirally arranged in the elongated viruses and packed on sides of the polyhedral particles \\nof the spherical virues. In transverse section the elongated viruses appear as hollow tubes \\nwith the protein subunits forming the outer coat and the nucleic acid, also spirally \\narranged, embedded between the inner ends of two successive spirals of the protein \\nsubunits. The rhabdoviruses and a few spherical viruses are provided with an outer \\nlipoprotein envelope or membrane. Inside the membrane is the nucleocapsid consisting \\nof nucleic acid and protein subunits. The nucleic acid makes up 5-40% of the virus protein \\nmaking up the remaining 60-95%. The spherical virus contain higher percentage of nucleic \\nacid whereas the low nucleic acid percentage is found in elongated virus. The weight \\nof nucleic acid ranges between 1-3 x 106 dalton per virus particle. Although some have \\n6 x 106 dalton. All viral nucleic acid sizes are quiet small as compared, to 0.5 x 109 dalton \\nfor mollicutes and 1.5 x 109 dalton for bacteria. \\nThe protein shell of plant viruses are composed of repeating sub-units. The amino \\nacid content and sequence for identical protein subunits of a given virus are constant \\nbut vary for different viruses and even for different strains of the same virus. The content \\nand sequences of amino acids are known for the proteins of many viruses. For example \\nthe protein subunit of TMV consist of 158 amino acids in a constant sequence with a \\nmass of 17,600 dalton. \\nThe protein subunits of TMV are arranged in a helix containing 16, 1/3 subunits \\nper turn (49 subunits per three turns). Each TMV particle consists of approximately 130 \\nhelix turn of protein subunits. The nucliec acid is packed tightly between the helices of \\nprotein subunits. In rhabdovirus the helical nucleoproteins are enveloped in a membrane. \\nIn polyhedral plant viruses the protein, subunits are tightly packed in arrangement \\nthat produce 20 facets and form a shell. In this shell the nucleic acid is folded or otherwise \\norganized. \\nThe nucleic acid of most plant viruses consists of RNA but about 80 viruses are known \\nto contain DNA. Both nucleic acid either DNA or RNA are long chain like molecules \\nconsisting of hundreds/thousands of units called nucleotides. The size of both RNA and \\nDNA is expressed either as Dalton or as the number of bases (Kb for ssRNA and DNA \\nor kilobase pairs (Kbp) for double stranded RNA and DNA. Most plant viruses contain \\n(540) ssRNA, but 40 contain dsRNA, 30 contain dsDNA and about 50 contain ssDNA. \\nSATELLITE VIRUS AND SATELLITE RNA \\nThe satellite viruses are virus that must always be associated with certain typical \\nviruses (helper viruses) because they depend upon the later for multiplication and plant \\ninfection.

Then the virus moves from cell to cell through plasmodes\\xad\\nmata, connecting the adjacent cells. Viruses multiply in each parenchyma cells infected. \\nIn leaf parenchyma the virus moves approximately 1 mm or 8-10 cells/day. \\nMost viruses require 2-5 days to move out of an inoculated leaf. In all economically \\nimportant viral infections virus reach the phloem and transport to long distance within \\nthe plant. Once the virus entered the phloem, it moves rapidly in it towards growing region \\nlike apical meristem and other food utilizing parts of the plant like tubers and rhizome. \\nThe development of local lesion symptoms is an indication of the localization of the \\nvirus within the lesion area. In systemic symptom the virus continued to spread beyond \\nthe borders of the lesion. \\nIn systemic virus infection some viruses are limited to phloem and a few adjacent \\nparenchyma cells. Many virus leave the growing point of stems or roots of affected plants \\napparently free of virus but few virus invade all new meristem tip tissues. \\nIt appears that the diseased condition induced in plants by viruses is the result of \\ninterference and disruption of normal metabolic processes in infected parenchyma or \\nspecialized cells. This interference is caused by the mere presence and multiplication of \\nvirus and possibly by the abnormal or toxic effects of additional virus-induced protein \\nor their products (not found yet). \\nPlant virus do not contain any enzymes, toxins or other pathogenic substances and \\nyet cause a variety of symptoms on host. Viral diseases of plant are not due primarily \\nto depletion of nutrients but due to more indirect effects of virus on the metabolism of \\nplant which is due to virus induced synthesis of new proteins by the host (like enzyme) \\nand may interfere with the normal metabolism of the host. \\nViral infection generally cause a decrease in photosynthesis through decrease in \\nchlorophyll/leaf, chlorophyll efficiency and leaf area per plant. Virus generally cause a \\ndecrease in the amount of growth regulating substances in the plant frequently by \\nincreasing a growth inhibiting substances. There is a decrease in soluble nitrogen during \\nrapid virus synthesis. A chronic decrease in the levels of carbohydrate is seen in the mosaic \\ndisease. \\nThe respiration of plants is generally increased immediately after infection but after \\nthe initial increase the respiration of infected plants became lower than that of healthy \\nplant. \\nSYMPTOMS \\nThe symptoms of plant virus diseases are of major importance in the identification \\nof the virus concerned. Most virus are named on the basis of chief symptom they produce \\non the host on which they were first reported. Symptomatology was very important in \\nthe early days of virus research before any of the viruses were isolated and characterized.138 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe external symptoms provide the first clue about possible viral infection but symptoms \\nchange under different environmental, nutritional and climatic conditions. They are also \\ninfluenced by the type and strain of virus, type and variety of host plant, age and stage \\nof development of virus and pathogens. Virus like symptoms may be caused by other plant \\npathogens like viroids, phytoplasma and fastidious bacteria. \\nThe term symptoms refers to visible abnormalities in plants. These symptoms are \\nin the form of colour changes of foliage or growth abnormalities. Mostly the hosts are \\naffected systematically by the viruses and the virus persist in infected· plants throughout \\nlife. Thus in vegetatively propagated plants the virus persist throughout life and the \\nprogenies are always virus infected. \\nWhen the infection remains confined near the site of virus entry, it is called local \\ninfection, but when infection spreads slowly to surrounding cells through plasmodesmata \\nand phloem to long distance in host system is called systemic infection. The time period \\nbetween the virus entry and first appearance of symptoms is called the incubation period. \\nThe abnormality develop in all parts of infected plants, not only externally but \\ninternally as well. \\nExternal Symptoms \\nThe external symptoms produced by virus infection is divided into two broad \\ncategories, those resulting due to infection of single inoculated cells of host plant and. \\nthose which cause systemic infection where the virus moves from the site of initial infection \\nto the entire plant. \\n(a) Colour changes: The word variegation refers to all types of colour changes on \\nleaves. The mosaic symptom are characterized by mottled green (spot or blotches of colour) \\nor patterns of green and yellow areas. When yellow colour is uniform and unbroken it \\nis known as chlorosis. In graminaceous plants, the mosaic pattern may be in the form \\nof streaks and stripes. Scorching of entire leaf or its margins is burnt appearance. In vein \\nclearing the tissues close to the veins turn yellow and the remaining lamina surface stays \\ngreen. In vein banding the tissue near the veins remain green and rest of the lamina surface \\nturns yellow. Colour changes are accompanied by some structural changes of the organ. \\nPouch like development of green parts of leaves are called puckering. The drying of cell \\nin a particular fashion leads to rings pots, black spots etc. The ring spot lesion consist \\nof a central group of dead cells beyond this there develop one or more superficial concentric \\nrings of dead cells with normal green tissue between them. Viruses producing ring spot \\ntype of symptoms are mostly transmitted by soil-living organism. Ring spot patterns may \\nalso occur on other organs for example bulbs and tubers. \\n(b) Changes in growth pattern: Leaf curl is a symptom in which leaves curl from \\nthe margins backward bringing the centre of the lamina upward. In leaf roll the margins \\nroll inward froming a trough like shape with midrib in the centre of the trough. The leaves \\nbecome thick and leathery due to accumulation of starch. Galls can be formed on leaves \\nand other organs. In mosaic diseases leaves may be abnormally lobed with fern like \\nappearance forming filiform or shoe-string structures. \\nVirus infected plants may show a wide range of developmental or growth abnor-PLANT VIRUSES 139 \\nmalities. Reduction in size of leaves and shoots is a common symptom in many virus \\ndiseases. When leaves are small they give a bushy appearance to the plant. Hypertrophy \\nand hyperplasia results in bunchy top or witches broom symptom. Stem sometimes show \\na spike like growth. Spindle tuber and spindle shoots are other growth abnormalities. \\nSome virus infections produces out growth or enations from the upper or lower \\nsurface of the leaves. These outgrowth are generally associated with vein of upper and \\nlower surface. These enations may be due to abnormal cell proliferation, as a result of \\nvirus induced changes in hormone concentration. Wound tumor virus produces wart like \\nout growths on the stems and roots of infected clover plants. \\n(c) Symptom on stems and roots: The major stem symptoms due to viral infection \\nare seen in swollen stems in cacao infected with cocoa swollen shoot disease. Tumors \\nare produced on the stem of clover plants by wound tumor virus. In woody plants stem \\nsymptom appears as flaking, cracking, necrosis of bark and excessive gum formation, stem \\nsplitting and scar formation. The prominent symptom seen on roots are abnormal \\nproliferation of rootlets, reduced number of adventitious roots. In legumes the N2 fixation \\nis reduced by virus infection. \\n(d) Flower Symptoms: In flowers the virus infection produces marked changes in \\ncolour. Colour breaking symptoms are very common in the flowers of many virus-infected \\nplants. The breaking usually consists of flecks, streaks or sectors of tissue. The breaking \\nof petal colour is due to loss of anthocyanin pigments. In a few instances there may be \\nincreased pigmentation in some areas of the petals. Infected flower are frequently smaller \\nand may drop prematurely. Flowers may be reduced in size, deformed in shape and quiet \\nfrequently flowering may be reduced. This effect the yield of viable seeds. \\n(e) Abnormalities in fruits, seeds and pollen: The viral infection show colour \\nchanges in the fruits. Fruits show mottling, ring, spotting and necrotic symptoms. Fruits \\nmay be distorted and misshappened. The texture of fruits can be changed like in cucumber \\nthe wart like projections develop due to cucumber mosaic virus infection. In tomato the \\nfruits may be dwarfed, malformed and seedless due to tomato aspermy virus. Virus \\ninfection may have drastic effects on seed production like in wheat, soybean. Sometimes \\nthe seed produced are completely abortive. The pollen production and pollens from \\ninfected plants are frequently sterile or viability is reduced. \\nIn musa cultivars infected with Banana virus the fruit bunch emerges from the side \\nof pseudo-stem inspite from the top of it. \\nInternal Symptoms \\nThe external symptom induced by viruses are frequently reflected in anatomical and \\nhistological changes within the plant. Mesophyll cells are smaller and less differentiated \\nwith few or no intercellular spaces. The vascular bundle may enlarge. The chloroplast \\nis reduced and as a result the tissue may become abnormally transleucent. Large number \\nof sieve elements in companion cells develop. Necrosis resisting from phloem may spread \\nto other tissues also. The internal changes in virus affected plants can be observed by \\nlight and electron microscopy and include anatomical and histological deviation, cyto\\xad\\nlogical and ultra structural changes and formation of inclusion bodies.140 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nTabacco \\nmosaic \\nCucumber Cucumber Cucumber Apple \\nmosaic mosaic on mosaic on mosaic on \\npepper squash cucumber \\n~:t \\nSeed \\n• Tomoto Tomoto \\nspotted wilt ringspot on grape \\nBlackberry \\nsterility \\nTomoto \\naspormy \\nPlum pox \\non apricot \\nI\\n~ \\'!i;\\' \\n~I \\n.\\', ~ \\nI \\nApple Stem \\nflat limb necrosis \\nPear rough \\nbark \\nNo\\'mal_~ \\n~1.) ~~ ~ \"\\'lor; \\n~t\">i; _. ;. \\nStunting Citrus tristezo \\nI \\nElm zonete Glerry black \\ncanker canker \\nBanong Cocoa \\nbWlChy top swollen rool \\nUI\\'~\"i.r.\\\\L\\\\1 , I\\' \"\\' :. \\nl.i~1 :1:;li1 . \"\\'I\\' -, \\' J 11 JVii.1t -\\nI , \\';IJ \\' \\nMaize dwarf \\nrings pot ringspot mosaic \\nGover \\nwound tumor \\nCitrus Apple \\nwoody gall scar skin \\nCucumber \\nmosaic on \\ngladiolus bulb \\nFig. 1 : Symptoms of viral diseases of plants \\nil \\nI I ..

These changes \\nare reflected in the form of particular external symptoms. The cells may decrease in size \\n(hypotrophy) or in number (hypoplasia), or may increase in size (hypertrophy) or in \\nnumber (hyperplasia). Excessive hyperplasia leads to proliferation of tissues causing \\nwitches broom, bunchy top etc. The cells may under go necrosis or deviate in content \\nlike reduction of chloroplast causes chlorosis and nuclear swelling. \\nIn leaves showing mosaic or yellowing symptom the palisade cell may be smaller \\nwith fewer chloroplast. The yellow areas have restricted growth which leads to buckling, \\npuckering and blistering. Extreme hypertrophy of lamina give rise to shoe string leaves. \\nEnlargments of cells adjacent to veins obliterates intercellular spaces and few chloroplasts \\nare produced making the tissue transleucent. \\nIn anatomical changes the phloem may destroy (phloem necrosis) eg-potato leaf roll \\ndisease. In curly top of sugar beet there is hyperplasia resulting in death of phloem \\nparenchyma. The abnormal meristamatic activity of phloem parenchyma resulting to \\nformation of tumors. \\nStem pitting or wood pitting symptoms are caused by development of localized areas \\nof disorganized parenchyma instead of xylem and phloem. \\n(b) Cytological and ultra structural changes: The main cell organelles influend by \\nviruses appear to be nucleus, chloroplast and mitochondria. In some cases disintegration \\nof cell organelles like ribosomes and endoplasmic reticulum may take place. \\nNuclei: Many viruses show no detectable change on the nucleus but some may give \\nrise to intranuclear inclusions of various sorts and may affect the nucleolus on the size \\nand shape of the nucleus. \\nNuclei texture become granular, chromatin may be reduced. Nucleoli become swollen \\nor hypertrophied and disintegrated eg-Geminivirus. Some times the nuclei may become \\nfilled with virus particles and greatly enlarged. The perinuclear space may be filled with \\nsome Rhabdo-viruses. Crystalline plate like inclusions were observed in cells infected with \\ntobacco etch virus. \\nChloroplast: There may be structural and biochemical degeneration of chloroplasts. \\nSmall peripheral vesicles may be seen in the chloroplast. Chloroplast may be swollen, \\nrounded and clumped together in the cell. Sometimes it become club shaped. There may \\nbe accumulation of starch grains and their size and number may be abnormal. The colour \\nmay be from normal green to colourless. Sometimes the chloroplast may be fragmented. \\nMitochondria: There may be regeneration or aggregation of mitochondria in virus \\ninfected cells. Sometimes mitochondria may be filled with vesicles also. \\nChanges in cell wall: Due to virus infection the cell become abnormally thickened. \\nThere may be deposition of electron dense material between cell wall and plasma \\nmembrane. Callus deposition may also be induced with some virus infections, which may \\nhelp in restricting virus movement. \\nRibosomes: There may be disturbances in the ribosomes. These may disappear or142 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nmay become integrated with inclusion bodies. There may be proliferation of the plasma\\xad\\nlemma to produce vesicles. \\nInclusions body: The major cytological effect of virus infection is development of \\ninclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies are the intra cells structures produced de novo as a \\nresult of virus infection. Inclusion bodies may contain virus particles, virus related \\nmaterials or ordinary cell constituents in a normal or degenerate conditions. These \\nintracellular inclusions is of diagnostic value. \\nMatz (1919), Kunkel (1921), and Smith (1924) were among the first workers to observe \\nthese inclusions and for some time a controversy centred about their nature. \\nThere are two main types of inclusions, crystalline and amorphorous (also known \\nas X-bodies). \\nInclusion bodies are most common in the epidermal cells of leaves and stems, but \\nthey also occur in the roots and flowers and in most tissues except the phloem sieve \\nelements. (Bawden 1964). \\nMcWhorter (1965) has tabulated the various types of intracellular inclusions as \\nfollows: \\nGroup A-Amorphous inclusions only, crystalline inclusions absent. Eg-Amorphous \\nspherules in wound tumour disease of Rumex acetosa. \\nGroup B-Amorphous and crystalline inclusions. Crystal in cytoplasm seldom or \\nnever present in the nucleus. TMV in tobacco, red clover vein mosaic in Vida faba. \\n~ \\nGroup C-Amorphous and crystalline inclusions; crystal present in both nuclei and \\ncytoplasm. Tobacco etch virus in solonaceae. \\nGroup D-Other entities unusual or only described in part in virus infected cells of \\nthe wild sunflowers. \\nX-bodies: The amorphous inclusion are called \\'X-bodies\\' and resemble certain \\nmicroorganism. They are amoeboid in shape and are virus induced structures in t:he cell \\nwhere components of viruses are synthesized and assembled. Matsui (1959) divided X\\xad\\nbodies into two categories based upon their fine structures. One appears elliptical in \\noutline and is almost entirely composed of dense granules varying in size, there is no \\nenvelope. The other usually appears spherical in outline and consists of a narrow \\nperipheral zone and large internal vacuole. \\nIntraplasmic crystalline Inclusions: Intracellular inclusions seem to be associated \\nonly with rod shaped virus particles. No inclusion bodies have been described in \\nconnection with \\'spherical\\' viruses although microcrystals of tomato bushy stunt virus \\nhave been observed in the cells of infected Datura stramonium. \\nIntranuclear inclusions: These inclusions are mainly in the form of thin plates, \\nbirefringent when seen from the edge. Their occurrence is sufficiently regular as to be of \\ndiagnostic value. \\nIntranuclear crystalline inclusions have been observed within leaves of Vicia Jaba \\nor Phaseolus vulgaris infected with bean yellow mosaic virus. The inclusions occurredPLANT VIRUSES 143 \\nfrequently in groups in the nucleoplasm whereas they usually occurred singly \\nwithin the nucleolus and were so large to distort it. The inclusions revealed a regular \\nperiodicity of striation within them. The cytoplasm also contained similar crystalline \\ninclusions. \\nBuffer \\nIn phloem, viral nucleic acid or \\nvirus is carried with the photo· \\nsynthate throughout the plant \\nViral nucleic acid \\nVirus taken in by Viral nucleic acid Viral nucleic acid replicates in \\nwounded cell freed from coat cell.

There are the spindle bodies found in virus affected cacti, and \\nthe bizarre \\'pin-wheels\\' and \\'cat-O-nine tails\\'. \\nPresence of inclusions composed of vesicles and virus in some immature tracheary \\nelements may indicate that virus multiplies in these cells. Complex membranous \\nstructures together with unbranched tubules containing single rows of virus-like \\nparticles have been observed in the case of strawberry latent rings pot virus and cow \\npea mosaic virus. \\nCLASSIFICATION & NOMENCLATURE \\nMost of the plant viruses are named after the most conspicuous symptom they cause \\non the first host in which they have been studied. Thus a virus causing mosaic on tobacco \\nis called Tobacco mosaic virus, whereas the disease itself is called tobacco mosaic; another \\nvirus causing spotted wilt symptom on tomato is called tomato spotted wilt virus, and \\nthe disease is called tomato spotted wilt. \\nAll viruses belong to kingdom viruses. Within the kingdom, viruses are distinguished \\nas RNA viruses and DNA viruses depending upon wheather the nucleic acid of virus144 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nis RNA or DNA. These viruses are further divided depending upon wheather they possess \\none or two strands of RNA or DNA of either positive or negative sense, either filamentous \\nor isometric. Within each of these groups there may be viruses replicating via a polymerase \\nenzyme (+ RNA or DNA virus) or via a reverse transcriptase (-RNA or DNA viruses). \\nMost virus consist of nucleic acid surrounded by coat protein, but some also have a \\nmembrane attached to them. Some viruses have all their genome in one particle (monopartite \\nviruses) but the genome of other (multipartite) viruses is divided among two, three or rarely \\nfour particles. Other classification characteristic include the symmetry of helix in helical \\nviruses or number and arrangement of protein subunits in the isometric viruses, size of \\nvirus and any other physical, chemical or biological properties. \\nThe current nomenclature and classification scheme of plant viruses is as follows:-\\ncD \\n~~0 \\n~A a ® \\nr=Purines ,&$~ 1.,,[PY} rimidines / k, ~ \"t \\n.1.1.

Most of the work is largely confined \\nto estimation of alterations in various components like carbohydrates, sugars, phenolics, \\nalkaloids growth regulators, nucleic acids. Important metabolic functions like photosyn\\xad\\nthesis, respiration and transpiration rates were also changed. Mostly the changes taking \\nplace in leaves have been studied, because they constitute most of the herbaceous host \\nplant.

There are mostly reports of increase in respiration rate in mosaic diseased plants. \\nBut in some cases where disease is well developed respiration rate may be lower. In plants \\ndeveloping local lesions the respiration rate is always higher. Increased respiration may \\ninvolve increase in the activity of some enzymes of glycolytic and pentose phosphate \\npathways. The results have been contradictory because various variable factors have not \\nbeen taken into account. \\nPhotosynthesis \\nVirus infection usually affects the process of photosynthesis. There is reduced carbon \\nfixation due to virus infection which may be due to a variety of biochemical and physical \\nchanges and becomes detectable a few days after infection. \\nChloroplast colour may change from normal green to colourless. There is a reduction \\nin the number of grana and chlorophyll content. Photosynthetic activity can be changed \\nor reduced due to change in chloroplast structure by reduced content of photosynthetic \\npigments or by reduction in specific proteins. \\nThe biochemistry of photosynthesis and related pathways can be affected as a result \\nof virus infection. There may be diversion of the products of photosynthesis carbon \\nfixation. Instead of sugar formation there may be production of organic acid and amino \\nacid. These changes, may be transitional and may return to normal pattern when active \\nvirus multiplication is over. \\nThe most general effect of virus infection is a reduction in photosynthetic activity \\nwhich is due to change in a variety of biochemical and phYSiological changes. \\nTranspiration \\nIn severly infected plants, transpiration rate is generally reduced as compared to \\nhealthy plants. The reported effects over the first 1-2 weeks after inoculation vary. \\nEnzymes \\nInfection may affect enzyme activities through changes in the amount of enzyme \\ninhibitors or activators released when cells are disrupted. Increase in catalase, peroxidase \\n(enzyme or isoenzymes) and polyphenol oxidases has been reported for various host-virus \\ncombinations. There is a marked increase in the activity of nucleases enzyme which may \\nbe because of there direct involvement with virus synthesis. Increase in activity was also \\nobserved in acid phosphatase, aconitase and starch synthetase in different host-virus \\ncombination. However pentose phosphate isomerease and succinyl co-A synthetase \\nactivity was decreased following infection with TMV in tobacco plants. Virus infection \\nC\\'in also affect the expression of host genes encoding enzymes. \\nHormones \\nVirus infection influences hormone activities in infected plants and plant hormones.150 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nQuantitative effects of infection on concentration have been shown for all the major groups \\nof plant hormones. Systemic virus infections tend to impair the steady state auxin levels \\nwith consequent morphological alterations. Stunting in virus infected plants has been \\nassociated with a decrease in gibbrellins. Change have been observed in reduced or \\nincreased cytokinins and absicic acids. \\nThe most affected plant growth regulator is ethylene which is associated with \\nsenescence in plants. Generally its production is increased in virus\\' infection. \\nCHANGES IN LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT METABOLITES \\nThere are reports of accumulation of free amino acids in virus infected plants. An \\nincrease in amides (glutamine and asparagines) may be due two reasons: either due to \\nthe breakdown of host proteins or due to inhibition of normal protein synthesis as a result \\nof which they are not properly utilized and accumulate in free from. However in many \\nhost virus combinations deficiency of both soluble and insoluble nitrogen compounds may \\noccur during periods when virus is rapidly being synthesized. \\nPhosphorus is a vital component of all viruses and disturbances in phosphorus \\ncontent is observed in virus infected plants. However there is no clear picture of the effect \\nof virus infection on host phosphorus metabolism. Increase in organic acid synthesis \\nduring virus replication is reported. Some essential elements like Mn, Cu, Zn are highly \\nreduced in virus infection whereas the infection has slight effect on K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Band \\nAI. Reduction in specific mineral elements are associated with certain virus disease \\nsymptoms. \\nVirus infection causes loss of chlorophylls giving the yellowish colouration due to \\ncarotene and xanthophylls but these pigments are also decreased in\\' some diseases. In \\nsome virus infections particularly characterized by dark green symptoms, there may be \\nmore chlorophyll than the uninoculated control plants. \\nChanges in nucleic acid: Virus infection has little effect on DNA content of host cell. \\nHowever this infection affect differently with RNA synthesis in different host virus \\ncombinations. Chloroplast and cytoplasmic rRNA synthesis may be affected as a result \\nof virus infection. This effect of infection may vary with age. The changes observed in \\nyoung and old leaves significantly vary. A reduction in chloroplast ribosomes without \\na marked effect on cytoplasmic ribosomes is a fairly common feature for mosaic diseases. \\nChanges in Proteins: There is a substantial reduction in host protein synthesis (by \\n75%), when the virus is actively replicating in virus infection. During this period the host \\nmachinery is involved in the synthesis of viral proteins rather than host proteins. The \\ncoat protein of a virus (like TMV) can represent half of the total protein in the diseased \\nleaf. A reduction in the amount of most abundant host protein ribulose biphosphate \\ncarboxyl oxygenase (RUBISCO) is one of the commonest effects of virus that cause mosaic \\nand yellowing diseases. \\nLipids: The lipid content of leaves infected with virus may be greater than healthy \\nleaves or in few host-virus combinations it may be less. \\nCarbohydrates: Virus infection significantly influences the carbohydrate synthesisPLANT VIRUSES 151 \\nas well as rate of translocation. There is a large accumulation of carbohydrate and sugars \\nin virus-infected leaves as compared to healthy leaves. \\nIn conclusion, Diener (1963) considers that the physiological derangements most \\ncommonly associated with plant virus infections are as follows: (i) decreased photosyn\\xad\\nthetic activity (ii) increased rate of respiration (iii) accumulation of soluble nitrogen \\ncompounds, particularly amides; (iv) increased activity of polyphenol oxidase and \\naccumulation of oxidized polyphenol derivatives. (v) decreased activity of growth regu\\xad\\nlating substances. \\nViral Diseases of Tomato \\nThe first record of virus diseases of tomato in India seems to be by Likhite in 1930. \\nThe leaf curl of tomato was\\' described in 1948. Sastry and Singh (1971, 1974a), Sastry \\net al. (1976) and Singh et al., (1973) have made detailed study of reiationship between \\nvector, vector control, and incidence of tomato leaf curl. Viral diseases causes severe losses \\non all fresh market and canning tomatoes. \\nLEAF CURL OF TOMATO \\nThe disease has been reported from India, Sri Lanka, Nyasaland (Malawi) and South \\nAfrica. Leaf curl disease incidence is reported to be 83% in the winter crop planted in \\nOctober and 14% in the summer crop planted in February (Tripathi and Varma, 2002). \\nWhen the plants are infected within 20 days of transplanting the loss may be up to 92% \\nwhile infections of 35 and 50 days old crops result in 74 and 29% loss, respectively. \\nSymptoms \\nLeaf curl is characterized by severe stunting of the plants due to shortening of \\ninternodes and downward rolling and crinkling of the leaves. The newly formed leaves \\nshow chlorosis. The older curled leaves become leathery and brittle. After the plant \\nbecomes infected there is considerable drop of flowers, fruit fails to set, and no more \\nmarketable fruit is produced. The whole plant looks pale and produces more lateral \\nbranches resulting in a bushy appearance. There is partial or complete sterility of the plant. \\nThe Causal Organism \\nLeaf curl of tomato is caused by the Tobacco leaf curl virus (geminivirus group or \\nfamily Geminiviridae, genus Begomovirus). Its synonyms are Tobacco cabbaging virus, \\ntobacco curly leaf virus and tobacco frenching virus. The genome of geminiviruses is \\ncomposed of circular, single stranded DNA, encapsulated by multiple subunits of a single \\ncapsid protein. Most are bipartite having two almost equal sized genomic components \\ndesignated A and B, separately encapsulated in geminate particles (Poiston et al. 1997). \\nThe Indian isolates from New Delhi and Karnataka have been separately named such \\nas Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNdV), a bipartite strain, and Tomato leaf curl \\nBangalore virus (ToLCBV), a monopartile strain. Chakraborty et al (2003) have described \\ntomato leaf curl Gujarat virus (ToLCGV) from Varanasi in India which causes a severe \\nleaf curl disease of tomato.152 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nDisease Cycle \\nThe geminate particles of the leaf curl virus (ToLCV) measure 25-30 x 15-20 nm. The \\nToLCV is neither seed nor sap transmissible but external contamination of seed m2ty occur. \\nDodder transmission has been reported in India. The main agency of its transmission \\nin nature is the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci. TYLCV is a whitefly transmitted geminivirus \\ngenome consists of a single circular SSDNA the genome of the other known whitefly \\ntransmitted goes viruses consists of two ssDNA. The vector can transmit the virus after \\na 20-minute acquisition access period and 60 min of inoculation access period with \\nminimum latency period of 4-9 hours. In India, the virus is reported to be transmitted \\nby the vector after 30 minutes of acquisition access and 30 min of inoculation access \\nperiods with a latency period of 6 hours. Even a single viruliferous whitefly is able to \\ntransmit the virus. The virus is retained by the vector for more than 12 days or for the \\nwhole life but there is no evidence that it multiplies in the vector or is transferred to the \\nprogeny of the vector. The time required for symptom expression varies in different \\ncultivars of tomato. Whitefly populations per plant also vary with host cultivar. The \\nnumber of whiteflies per plant has no relationship with the time of appearance or severity \\nof symptoms. At low temperatures symptoms are delayed. \\nControl and Treatment \\nResistance to the virus in commonly cultivated tomato varieties is lacking. Wild \\ntomato (Lycopersicon pemvianum) has high degree of resistance to the leaf curl virus. L. \\nglalldulosll1n also does not show symptoms of leaf curl. Some accessions of the wild species \\nLycopersicon hirslltll11l have been identified as the best source of resistance to tomato leaf \\ncurl virus as well as tomato yellow leaf curl virus. In Punjab, the genotypes TLB 111, \\n119, 122, 128, 129, 130 and 134 have been found resistant to ToLCV. \\nProtection of seedlings from infection brought by the vectors is important. It can be \\nachieved by using insecticides or insect repellents. Tripathi and Verma (2002) have \\ndemonstrated that seedlings protected by perforated polythene bags and transplanted in \\npolysheet mulched fields have low incidence of the disease. Some workers have claimed \\ngood control of the disease through reducing vector population. Use of systemic insec\\xad\\nticides such as methyl parathion (0.02%) and dimethoate (0.5%) as spray of carbofuran \\n(1.5 kg a.i.jha) as soil application has been found effective in controlling build up of \\nwhitefly population and thus reducing the incidence of leaf curl. Spraying should be \\nstarted soon after transplanting. Carbofuran (Furadon 3G) at the rate of 3.3gj Sq.lll. not \\nonly reduces disease incidence but also increases fruit yield. Nursery treatment, seedling \\nsoak, and plot treatments reduce populations of Bemisia tabaci and diseases incidence. \\nSastry et al (1976) suggested increased plant population from 30 to 90 per sq.m., three \\napplications of insecticides (parathion 0.02%, demetonmethyl 0.02% or dimethoate 0.05%) \\nas spray at 15-days interval with one soil application of phorate or carbofuran for control \\nof the disease. Foliar application of the antibiotics Validomycin-A (0.02%), Avomycin-A \\n(0.01 %) and of guanidine azoguanine, etc. suppress the disease. Mukherjee and \\nRaychaudhuri (1966) had reported that the root dip of tomato seedlings in gibberellic acid \\nand 2-thiouracil at 50 pp, reduces leaf curl incidence. Spraying of 2,4-D is highly effectivePLANT VIRUSES 153 \\nin not only suppressing tomato leaf curl incidence but also in many-fold increase of fruit \\nyield. \\nIn some countries like Israel, because of TYLCV, tomatoes are now produced only \\nunder fine mesh and frequent application of insecticides.

The common tomato mosaic was \\nearlier thought to be the same as TMV but now it is considered to be a distinct virus \\n(ToMV) of the same tobamovirus group. \\nSymptoms \\nThe symptoms of tomato mosaic are generally influenced by temperature, day length, \\nlight intensity, plant age, virus strain, and tomato variety. In the tropics or in warm weather \\nwith long day length and high light intensity leaves show light and dark green mosaic \\nmottle, sometimes with distortion of young leaves. Green areas are sunken giving the leaf \\na rough appearance. In winter, with low light intensity, short day length, and temperature \\nnot above 20°C, plants often are severely stunted and leaves distorted to \"fern-Ieaf\" or \\ntendril-shape but mottling may be slight. Seedling infection may kill the plants. Fruits \\nare fewer, undersized, and often deformed. In some cases there is necrosis of stem, petioles, \\nleaves and fruits. \\nIn aucuba mosaic the symptoms appear as downward curling of the whole leaf \\nwith slight turning down at the margins. Surface of the leaf is rough, wrinkled or \\ncorrugated. Chlorosis appears as small points of yellow areas and gradually spreads. \\nIn extreme cases almost the entire lamina of old and new leaves becomes pale yellow \\nto white, with scattered small islands of green which stand up as blisters. In less extreme \\ncases the green areas are larger but not as large as the chlorotic areas. The plant is \\nnot killed but growth is retarded. The virus induces pollen sterility which results in \\nlow fruiting and low yield. \\nThe Causal Organism \\nThe virus causing the common mosaic of tomato is known as TOlllato mosaic virus \\n(ToMV, tobamovirus group). There are many strains of the virus producing different \\nsymptoms and often these have been described as different diseases. These strains are \\ntomato aucuba mosaic, tomato enation mosaic, yellow rings spot strain and tomato rosetted \\nstrain. \\nParticles of the virus are straight tubules with helical construction and measure 300 \\nx 18 nm. The single stranded RNA constitutes about 5% of the particle weight. The \\nparticles occur in all the tissues including the pollen and seed but not in the embryo. \\nThe inclusion bodies appear as crystalline structures, amorphous masses, fine needles, \\nfibrous spikes, spindle bodies, and amoeboid X-bodies.154 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nDisease Cycle \\nIn tomato sap the thermal inactivation point is 85-900C, dilution end point is 1:100000 \\nto 1:1000000. In air-dried tomato leaves the virus has been found to remain infective even \\nafter 24 years at laboratory temperatures. The sap retains infectivity for 77 days or more \\nat laboratory temperatures and for several years at 0° to 2°C. The virus, like the TMV, \\nis easily sap transmissible and is mainly transmitted by man through contact during \\ncultivation. No natural vector are known. Seed transmission also occurs mainly as external \\nseed contamination. TMV and ToMV become established in the seeds of tomato and bell \\npepper, irrespective of plant growth stage, at the time of inoculation. However, concen\\xad\\ntration of the virus is high in seeds from plants inoculated early. Dodder can transmit \\nthe virus. Diseased crop debris is also a source of primary inoculum. \\nControl \\nUse of virus-free seedlings is the most important step for control of tomato mosaic. \\nTo produce healthy seedlings the seedbeds should be those in which no solanaceous crop \\nsusceptible to TMV had been grown for the last 4-6 months. Soil sterilization by heat is \\nalso recommended. Seeds should be treated in hot water at 50°C for 25 min or with 20% \\ntrisodium phosphate solution. There should be an interval of at least 5 months between \\nsusceptible crops in the same filed. Field workers should avoid use of tobacco products \\nwhile working in the field. If they remove a diseased plant they should wash their hands \\nin soap solution. \\nRICE TUNGRO VIRUSES \\nTungro is the most important virus disease of rice in south and south-east Asia and \\nalso in the southern part of China. The virus is reported from Philippines, Malaysia, \\nIndonesia, Thailand, India and Pakistan. In India the disease is present in the south east \\nto the north west parts of the country. The annual loss due to tungro is estimated at US \\n$ 1.5 billion globally. \\nSymptoms \\nIn rice the symptoms depend on host cultivar. In the cultivar TN 1, seedlings show \\nstunting with mottling and yellowing of leaves. In growing plants there is reduced \\ntillering. Yellowing and orange yellow coloration of leaves is a common symptom. Small \\nand sterile panicles develop in mature plants. In early infection the young plants may \\ndie prematurely. \\nThe Causal Organism \\nTungro is a composite disease caused by two viruses: the rice tungro spherical virus \\n(RTSV) and the rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV). The RSTV is a ssRNA virus which \\ncauses only very mild stunting of the host plants without leaf symptoms but it intensifies \\nthe symptoms of tungro caused by RTBV. The RTBV is a dsDNA bacilliform virus which \\ncauses mild stunting and yellowing of leaves. RTBV causes the main symptoms of tungro. \\nIt is dependent on RSTV for transmission by the insect vectors. In Philippines and SouthPLANT VIRUSES 155 \\nand South East Asia the RTSV occurs and spreads as an independent virus but generally \\nas a latent disease. \\nRTSV is associated with maize chlorotic dwarf virus group. The particles of RTSV \\nare isometric with a diameter of 30-33 nm. The ssRNA is in single piece (mono partite) \\nand constitutes 12% of the particle weight. The RTSV RNA consists of about 11 kb, and \\nits protein coat is made of two types of protein molecules. The RTBV belongs to Budnavirus \\ngroup. The particles are bacilliform, 100-400 nm long and 30-35 nm in diameter. Both \\nviruses are transmitted by same leafhopper vectors. The thermal inactivation point of RTSV \\nis 60°C. The longevity in vitro at room temperature is 24 hours, one week at 4°C and one \\nmonth in frozen samples. In the host cells dense granules are seen in the cytoplasm. \\nChloroplasts and other cell organelles in the infected tissues are degenerated. \\nDisease Cycle \\nOnJza species are the main host but at least 63 species of grasses could be infected. \\nNatural occurrence on grasses in and around rice fields is reported. However, all except \\nOnJza species are poor hosts of the vectors. \\nThe rice tungro viruses are not transmitted by sap inoculation or ,by seed or dodder. \\nIn nature the main agency of tungro transmission is the green leafhopper, Nephotettix \\ncincticeps (N. virescens). Other vectors are N. nigropictus, N. malayanus, N. parvus, N. apicalis \\nand Recilia (Anazuma) dorsalis. N. cincticeps is the most effective vector and disperses the \\nvirus in the rice fields. All the five larval stages and adults of the leafhopper vector transmit \\nthe viruses in non-persistent manner. There is strong biological relationship of the vector \\nwith rice plants on which it has high adult longevity, nymph survival and population \\ngrowth. Minimum acquisition feed period is 5-7 min but transmission increases with \\nacquisition access feeding upto 4 days. There is no latency. The vector becomes viruliferous \\nimmediately after feeding. Nymphs cease to transmit the virus when they molt. All stages \\nlose ability to transmit the virus within 5 days after the end of the acquisition feed. Weed \\nhosts that may playa role in survival and dissemination of the rice tungro viruses include \\nLeersia hexandra, Eleusine indica, Echinochloa crusgalli, Echinochloa glabrescens, E. colona and \\nLeptochloa chinensis. \\nN. cinticeps is monophagous to rice. Its density can reach high levels depending on \\nthe environment. After rice is harvested, the density of this vector falls rapidly to a low \\nlevel or to nil in the rice fields. Seasonal pattern of immigration and population dynamics \\nof the major vectors (N. cincticeps, N. nigropictus and Recilia dorsalis) determines the \\nincidence of tungro. Under Assam conditions, Nath and Bhagabati (2002) observed that \\nleafhopper populations are first seen during June-July in the seedbeds. The population \\nreaches the peak in the main field in October-November and then disappears from \\nDecember to May. N. virescens populations were lower than N. nigropictus but higher than \\nR. dorsalis. Tungro infected plants including rice stubbles or volunteer rice serve as source \\nof RTBV and RTSV. The vector that feeds on source plants, moves to newly transplanted \\nfields in surrounding areas and disperses the viruses. Probably the flight range of N. \\ncincticeps is several kilometers. Initially few plants are infected and form the source for \\nfurther spread. Generally, the plants with secondary infection from such sources form156 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\npatches a few to several meters in diameter. Such patches later fuse with each other. In \\ntungro-endemic areas major infection of rice plants with the viruses occurs after trans\\xad\\nplanting. Infection rate in the seedbeds is low. In transplanted fields, infection with RTSV \\nalone precedes infection with RTBV. The disease incidence is generally low in fields \\nplanted in the early crop season when the vector population is low, but it is high in fields \\nplanted later when the vector population has built up. \\nControl \\nUse of rice cultivars resistant to tungro has been a major approach for control of. \\nthe disease. The resistance to the viruses is correlated with resistance to the vectors. The \\nresistant cultivars become susceptible in few years because populations of the vector \\ndevelops that can feed on these cultivars. A transgenic japonica rice plant is reported that \\ncontains RTSV replicase gene. Plants expressing full length Rep gene in the (+) sense \\norientation show 100% resistance to RTSV even if challenged with a high level of \\ninoculum. The rice cultivar Basmati 370 is reported to be resistant. In many countries long \\nfallow periods reduce the disease incidence. \\nPlant extracts have been used to reduce the population of the vector and disease \\nseverity. Metabolites of the rice false smut fungus, Claviceps onjZae sativae, are reported \\nto provide tolerance in rice to the tungro disease. Neem seed cake applied at 5 kg/0.032 \\nha of nursery followed by foliar spray of 5% neem kernel extract in the main field reduces \\nvector population and incidence of tungro. Two fungi, Beauveria bassiana and Paecilomyces \\namoeneroseus, are reported as parasites of rice green leaf hopper, Nephotettix virescens. Spray \\nof conidial suspension of the fungi on rice plants kills the vectors. \\nSUGARCANE MOSAIC \\nMosaic is most widely distributed and best known of the virus diseases of sugarcane. \\nIt was initially reported from Java in 1892 but now it is known to be of worldwide \\noccurrence being common in India, North and South Americas, and many Pacific and \\nAtlantic islands. The occurrence of sugarcane mosaic in India was first discovered in 1921 \\nat Pusa (Bihar). Although a source of potential danger to sugar industry in countries like \\nthe USA, the disease has not been regarded as menace to sugarcane in this country. Even \\na 100% mosaic affected crop shows a reduction of about 10-12% in yield and the juice \\nquality remains unaffected. Perhaps, it is due to prevalence of some mild strain(s) of the \\nvirus occurring in most of the sugarcane varieties in India. There are indications that more \\nvirulent strains are also present in the country on certain varieties like Co. 313 in Punjab \\nand Co. 527. The disease may cause as much as 21 % loss in yield. \\nSymptoms \\nThe first symptom of sugarcane mosaic appear about 6 weeks after planting and \\ncontinue to develop throughout the monsoon season after which they are obliterated on \\nmaturity of the plants. The primary and critical symptom of the disease is the appearance \\nof pale patches or blotches in the green surface of the leaf. Small areas of the leaf are \\nof a paler green colour than the rest. These patches are not uniform in size and shape.PLANT VIRUSES 157 \\nThey may be large in some varieties and small in others. Usually they are oval or elongated, \\nthe longer axis lying parallel to the midrib. In other parts of the world, the patches on \\nsugarcane leaf are not confined between veins but in India there is a clear demarcation \\nof these patches by the leaf veins. The youngest unfolded leaves show the mottling very \\nclearly while the symptoms are not very clear on older leaves. Sometimes leaves of young \\ntillers are stiff, erect and crinkled. Mottling of the stem also occurs in some varieties and \\nmay lead to death of cells resulting in formation of cankers. \\nThe cells of affected leaves always show, in one part of the cytoplasm, an area of \\nproteolysis. This can be seen under microscope as a more heavily stained area than the \\nrest and consisting of a vacuolated mass representing the X-body. Stems may show \\nmottling or marbling , the areas later becoming necrotic. The stems becomes small and \\ndeformed. \\nThe Causal Organism \\nSugarcane mosaic virus (750 x llnm) is transmitted primarily vegetatively in \\nsugarcane during propogation of the crop. The disease is caused by sugarcane mosaic \\nvirus (SCMV) which belongs to potyviruses group. Its synonym is grass mosaic virus. \\nThe particles of the virus are flexuous filaments measuring 620-750 x 13-15 nm. Maximum \\nconcentration of virus particles is found in young leaves and minimum in roots of old \\ninfected plants. Particle composition is not fully known. In addition to sugarcane, the virus \\ncan infect other graminaceous plants such as maize, sorghum, millets, wheat, barley, \\nrye, and some grasses. Natural occurrence of the virus on maize, sorghum, pearl millet \\nand elephant grass has been reported from India. Brachiaria is also a natural host of \\nsome strains of SMV. One strain that attacks Mllsa textilis has some hosts outside the \\ngramineae. \\nThe following serologically related potyviruses were considered strain of the Sug\\xad\\narcane mosaic vims. Sugarcane mosaic strains A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K (these strains \\nrarely infect sorghum), Maize dwarf mosaic strain A and B, Sorghum red stripe strain, \\nEuropean maize mosaic strain and Abaca mosaic strain on Musa textilis. \\nDisease Cycle \\nThe virus is transmitted from sugarcane to sugarcane by at least 7 species of aphids \\nsuch as Dacttj1lOtus ambrosiae, Hysterolleura setariae, Rhopalosiphll1n maidis, Toxoptera graminum, \\nR. maidis and Shizaphis graminum are reported as vectors of sugarcane mosaic virus in \\nIndia. Transmission is in the non-persistent manner. Seed transmission is reported only \\nfor maize dwarf mosaic strain. Vegetative propagation is the main source of primary \\ninfection in sugarcane. \\nThe thermal inactivation point of SCMV is 53-55°C and dilution end point 1:1000. \\nIn vitro longevity is 2-24 hours. \\nFor experimental purposes the virus can easily be transmitted by introducing it into \\nthe actively growing tissues. Young leaves are most suitable for testing. Most common \\nmethod is to use a needle to puncture the tissue over which infected juice has been spread \\nor infected leaf has been wrapped. SCMV moves from the point of inoculation to young158 TEXT BOOK .OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nleaves, roots and tillers and eventually to leaves that had emerged prior to inoculation. \\nThe pattern of SCMV distribution in moderately resistant and susceptible cultivars is not \\nmuch different. However, the virus moves more slowly in the moderately resistant than \\nin the susceptible cultivar. \\nControl \\nDue to continuous evolution of strains of the virus, its presence on grass or cultivated \\ncollateral hosts and long growing season of the sugarcane crop, resistant varieties are \\nnot permanent solution of the mosaic problem. Following practices have been recom\\xad\\nmended to minimize its incidence. \\n1. Use of selected healthy setts for seed. \\n2. Heat therapy (hot water or hot air) is effective against certain strains and can \\nbe used for raising disease-free nurseries. \\n3. Systematic rouging of the infected canes if the incidence is not very high. \\n4. Elimination of grass hosts. \\n5. Use of resistant or tolerant varieties. \\nALGAL VIRUSES-THE CYANOPHAGES \\nCyanophages are the viruses that attack on cyanobacteria i.e. the members of blue \\ngreen algae. The first actual demonstration of an algal virus was made by Safferman & \\nMorris (1963) from the waste stabilization pond of Indiana University (USA). They isolated \\nthe virus from the filamentous blue-green alge Plectonema bonJanum. Safferman and morris \\ntested 78 algal species For susceptibility to the virus and of these the virus lysed 11 \\nfilamentous strains. Among the genera infected were LyngbtJa, Plectonema and Phormidium. \\nThe first algal virus was named as strain LPP-I, the initials representing these three hosts. \\nThere after several serological strains of LPP were isolated and named LPP-I LPP-2, \\nLPP-3, LPP-4 and LPP-5. These viruses are called as blue green algal viruses or \\ncyanophages. They screened 78 host organisms and found the cyanophages only in 11 \\nfilamentous cyanobacteria. \\nAfter the initial discovery several workers including Singh et al from Banaras Hindu \\nUniversity, India and Padan et al (1967) from Israel, Daft et al (1970) from Scotland \\nreviewed different type of cyanophages. \\nProperties of Cyanophages \\n(1) The morphology of LPP-I is studied in more detail as compared to other \\ncyanophages. They differ, morphologically as well as in their physio chemical properties. \\n(2) They are an icosahedron with a hexagonal head capsid and the tail is short with \\na length of approximately one quarter the diameter of the capsid (similar to T3 and T7 \\nbacteriophages) where as N-I group resembles with T2 and T4 phages (like T even, the \\ntail may be contractile or non-contractile). According to Smith et al. (1966b) the tail \\nassembly is longer in virus particles attached to the photosynthetic membranes.PLANT VIRUSES 159 \\n(3) According to Goldstein & Bendet (1967) U 3P-I has double stranded DNA and \\ncan be concentrated by acetone without significant loss in activity. \\n(4) The AS-I group has the largest cyanophages. The group G m and D-I are \\nserologically related but not show any relationship with T -phages. \\nLife Cycle \\nSimilar like bacteriophages the cyanophages follow the same one-step growth curve. \\nThe growth cycle resembles with that of T 4 phages. \\nThe first sign of infection in the alga can be readily recognized under optical \\nmicroscope by displacement of photosynthetic membranes. The actual infection of the alga \\ncan be observed on the electron microscope. Large number of virus particles can be seen \\nwith their tails inserted in the alga. \\nThe growth cycle of LPP-I has been studied in greater detail. LPP- I is adsorbed on \\nhost surface and the DNA is injected into the host cell leaving the protein coat outside \\nthe cell wall. The mechanism of DNA injection is not known. However soon after injection \\nof the genome the rate of protein synthesis is reduced and gradually blocked at the end \\nof 5 hour of injection. The phage multiplies in the invaginated photosynthetic lamellae \\nor in virogenic stroma. After injection following three types of proteins are formed earliest \\nproteins, earlier protein and the late or structural proteins. After three hours of infection, \\ndegradation of the host DNA begins and by the end of ~ hr it is converted into acid \\nsoluble matfrial. Sufficient amount of degraded DNA material is used up in building of \\nviral DNA. It is seen that in virogenic stroma synthesis of viral DNA takes place. The \\nlatent period differs in different viruses for example 7 hrs in LPP-I and N -I. At the end \\nafter maturation and assembly the progeny cyanophages are released almost from each \\ncell leaving aside the lysed cell. \\nAll nucleic acids of cyanophages analysed so far are linear double stranded DNAs. \\nThe cyanophages can playa significant role in control of blooms. But the problem is that, \\nthey are specific to genus and difficult to isolate. \\nOther Algal Viruses \\nAdolph and Haselkorn (1971), described a virus that attacks Nostoc, it has a long \\ncontractile tail which differentiates it from LPP-I and known as N-1. A virus similar \\nto N-I with a polyhedral head and a long tail, attacks only unicellular blue-green \\nalgae. \\nA presumed virus attacking Oscillatoria closely resembles TMV; it is a slender rod \\nabout 190A ° in diameter and 3000A ° in length. It aggregate to form crystalline granules. \\nLee (1971) described a virus from a algae (Sirodotia) it occurs in crystalline arrays of \\npolygonal particles each about 500-600A ° in diameter. \\nA virus has been isolated from a green alga, Oedogonium which occur in the germling \\nstages of the alga and is hexagonal in transverse section with a maximum dimension \\nof about 2400A o.160 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nA virus, resembling the Tipula irridescent virus has been found in a marine species. \\nThe brown alga, Chorda tomentosa, which is about 1,700 A ° in diameter and possess a \\ncore of electron dense material enclosed by three-layered electron dense shell. The spores \\ninfected with virus particle was unable to develop cell wall, possibly their synthesis is \\ninhibited by the virus. \\nCyanophages \\nG-III Group \\nLong tailed \\nUnnamed \\nD-l \\nN-Group \\nC-l \\nAR-1 \\nN-1 \\nSM-Group \\nSM-1 \\nSM-2 \\nAS-l \\nAS-I M \\nTABLE 1 \\nVarious Groups of Cyanophages \\nSources \\nPolluted water, B.H.U., \\nStream, Japan \\nScotland \\nPolluted water, B.H.U., \\nDo \\nDo \\nWaste stabilization ponds \\nIndiana, USA \\nFresh water \\nPolluted water \\nDo \\nHost \\nPlectonema bomjanum India by R.N.

They are wide spread \\nin all taxonomic groups of fungi. Indeed over 70 species representing all the main \\ntaxonomic groups of fungi have been involved (Hollings, 1975). \\nFor the first time Hollings (1962) gave the conclusive evidence of viruses that infected \\nthe cultivated mushrooms. Agaricus bisporus causing die back disease. The common \\nsymptom of mushroom virus disease are the loss of crop and the degeneration of mycelium \\nin the compost. At least 5000 fungal sps are known to contain mycoviruses. Most of the \\nspecies of Penicillium and /,spergillus have been found to be infected with viruses. \\nEcologically the mycophages appears to be intracellular, a life style for which they \\nare well fitted. \\nCharacteristics of Mycophages \\nAt present only few mycoviruses have been characterized and they are only the virus162 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nlike particles (VLPs) from the partially purified extracts from the fungus in electron \\nmicrograph of then section slides. \\nFive viruses have been isolated from mushrooms in Britain and they are known as \\nmushroom viruses 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Virus 3 is bacilliform (19 x 50 nm) while the other \\nfour are isometric virus (virus I = 25 nm, virus 2 = 29 nm, virus 4 = 35 nm while the \\nvirus 5 appears to be spherical in shape measuring 50 nm. (Hollings and Spire 1972). \\nThe mycoviruses have a heterogenous properties with a diameter (25-50 nm) and \\nparticle weight from 6-13 x 106 dalton. They possess 1-8 segments of dsRNA with a \\nmolecular weight of 2-8.5 x 106 dalton. All the known samples had only a single capsid \\nprotein but of varying molecular weight from 25-130 x 103 dalton in different viruses. \\nTransmission of mushroom viruses is by infected spores and by anastomosis of \\ninfected mycelium with healthy mycelium. Infected spores have a thinner wall than do \\nhealthy spores and germinate more quickly. Transmission by spores is so efficient that \\nno other vector is necessary. \\nDark (1979, 80) reviewed the replication of mycoviruses inside the host (the fungal \\ncell). He reported the host cell enzymes capable of transcribing the ssRNA and dsRNA \\nin vitro and probably dsRNA in vivo. Highly specific virus coded RNA polymerase are \\nnecessary for effective in vivo transcription and replication of dsRNA. Such polymerase \\nhas been demonstrated in a number of dsRNA mycoviruses. According to Buck, probably \\nthe polymerase remain confined within the virus particle during the replicative cycle of \\nmycoviruses. \\nExamples of Mycophages \\n(i) Mushroom (Agaricus bisporns) viruses \\nHollings & Spire (1972) recorded at least six viruses and VLP from cultivated \\nmushrooms, A. bisporns. The mycoviruses occur in a mixture of cells and are extremely \\nhard to separate. The number of spores in a suspension necessary to infect a tray is about \\nten. These viruses can cause water lodged stipes, or dry brown and leathery mushrooms, \\nor grey stunted clumps of dwarfed mushrooms that decay without further development \\nor thick short stalked mushrooms with poorly developed caps or long thin stalked \\nmushrooms. \\nIn recent years, there has been many reports of normal yield and mycelial growth \\nfrom virus infected mushroom crops suggesting that mycoviruses are not pathogenic \\n(Hollings, 1982). One of the possible reason may be due to, the suppression of virus \\nreplication and due to production of a mycotoxin (patulin) in several species of Penicillium \\nand Aspergillus. \\nA number of virus have been isolated from different sps of .Penicillium viz. P. \\nstolonifernm and P. junicliloslim are infected with viruses containing double stranded RNA. \\n(ii) Virus on other fungal sps. \\nFerault et al. (1971) isolated two types of virus particles from the spores of Piricularia \\nonJzae.PLANT VIRUSES 163 \\nSeveral different virus like particles have been isolated from Sclerotium cepivonlm \\nwhich is pathogenic to onions. Morphologically they are isometric, icosahedron. \\nVirus isolated from Ophiobolus graminis is a small isometric particles measuring about \\n29 nm in diameter. There are records of viruses and virus like particles from various species \\nof Puccillia. Lecoq et al. (1974) describe a virus particle 34 nm in diameter with a \\nsedimentation constant of 174S from Puccillia striiformis, P. mllivacearune and P. suavaeolens. \\nVirus like particles have been found in axenic cultures of Puccinia graminis. They are \\nisometric. \\nDue to the presence of mycoviruses in pathogenic fungi, the virulence of pathogens \\ngradually declines resulting in even death of fungi. Fungal isolates of take all of cereals \\n(caused by Gaellmannomyces graminis) containing only one kind of VLP\\'s are mostly more \\npathogenic than virus free isolate. Along with this a highly pathogenic isolate of G. \\ngramenis from wheat roots gradually lost the virulence over a period of 17 months in \\nculture. \\nSince viruses have been isolated from a number of plant pathogenic fungi, the \\npossibility of using viruses for the biological control of these fungi is a question of \\nimportance. \\nTaxonomic Position \\nTaxonomically, no serological relationship have been detected between any mycovirus \\nand morphologically similar viruses in higher plants. Similarly no mycoviruses is been \\ndemonstrated to infect higher plants. The members of international committee for virus \\ntaxonomy set a large taxonomic group to accommodate all dsRNA mycoviruses. Two such \\ngroups has now been designated. \\n(i) The Penicillium chnjsogenum virus group. \\n(ii) The Penicillium stoloniferum virus -S (PsV-S) group. \\nThe member viI:uses within each of these groups are serologically related. \\nTABLE 3 \\nTaxonomic Mfinity of Mycoviruses with other Viruses of Plants or Animals \\nMycovirus particles \\nRod-shaped particles \\nFilament particles \\nIsometric particles \\nBacilliform particles \\nMfinity with other viruses \\n(i) Tobamovirus type \\n(ii) Uncertain affinity \\nPotexvirus type \\nHerpes virus type \\nAlfalfa mosaic type \\nExample \\nPeziza ostracoderma \\nLentinus edodes \\nMycogone perinisa \\nArmillaria mellea \\nBoletus edulis \\nThrallstochytrium sp \\nPhytophthora infestans \\nAgaricus bisporus164 TEXT BOOK ,OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMost of the plant viruses contain RNA as genetic material.

It is world wide in distribution which \\naffects more than 150 genera mostly herbaceous (dicots), many vegetables, ornamental \\nflowers and weeds. It is the most resistant virus known so far of which the thermal death \\npoint is 90°C for 10 minutes. TMV was the first virus that was crystallized by Stanley \\nin 1935 from USA. \\nPathogen causes the damage on leaves, flowers, fruits and causes stunting in plants. \\nThe general symptom are chlorosis, curling, mottling, dwarfing, distortion and blistering \\nof leaves. TMV damages the solonaceous plant. After infection the common symptom is \\nappearance of irregular dark green and light green areas on the leaves (patchy pattern \\nof discoloured areas). The dark green areas are thicker and appears elevated, blister like \\nover the thinner, chlorotic light green areas. Slight downward curling and distortion of \\nleaves can also be seen. The leaves become narrow and elongated rather than oval shaped. \\nMottling of older leaves with or without malformations of the leaflets is produced \\nwhen the disease affects tomato. Leaflets become long and pointed and sometimes \\nshoestring like. The virus reduces the yield as well as quality of products i.e. nicotine \\ncontent is decreased by 20-30%. \\nFranklin et al. (1957) described the structure of TMV. It is rod shaped helical virus, \\n280 x 150 Ilm with a molecular weight of 39 x 106 dalton. The virion consist of protein \\ncoat, made up of 2,130 protein subunit of identical size. The protein subunits are arranged \\naround a central hole of 4 nm (40AO). Each protein subunit is made up of single \\npolypeptide chain made by 158 amino acids, the molecule weight of each polypeptide \\nchain is 17,500 dalton. The central/hole consist of ssRNA molecule which is also spirally \\ncoiled to form helix. This RNA consist of 6,500 nucleotides. In one turn of RNA contain \\n49 nucleotides. \\nTotal number of protein subunits counting in 3 turns is 49 i.e. 49/3 unit/turn. \\nTherefore single protein subunit is linked with 3 nucleotides TMV is an excellent \\nimmunogen. There are 3-5 different epitopes distributed over the surfa.ce of TMV protein. \\nThe two epitopes located on C-terminal and N-terminal extremities of polypeptide chain \\nare responsible for stimulating the production of antibodies. \\nTakeba (1975) demonstrated direct entry of TMV into the isolated protoplast from \\nmesophyll cells of tobacco. After entry the genetic material (RNA) rapidly starts uncoating \\nby removing the subunits from the capsid by using the host cell enzyme. The parented \\nRNA is localized in nucleus which do two functions, it acts as mRNA and direct the \\nsynthesis of protein and also function as template for the synthesis of complementary \\nstrand. \\nThe virus RNA utilizes the amino acids, ribosomes and tRNA of the host and \\nsynthesize the complementary strand and proteins, i.e. coat proteins of 17,500 dalton andPLANT VIRUSES 165 \\ntwo other polypeptide (of molecule weight 160,000 and 140,000 dalton). Nucleic acid is \\nabout 5-40% of virus and proteins 60-70%. \\nTMV is transmitted through cell sap of host and enters a new host through wound \\nincision. It is also transmitted by wind and water. \\nCryptogram of TMV = R/1 : 2/5 : E/E : 5/0. \\nCAMV (CAULIFLOWER MOSAIC VIRUS) \\nCaMV causes cauliflower mosaic on cauliflower. This is the plant virus where \\ndsDNA, open circular is the genetic material with single strand discontinuity like hepadna \\nvirus. In situ the DNA is linear but becomes circularized when extracted. \\nSingle virion has icosahedral symmetry of the capsid with 50 nm diameter. In infected \\ncauliflower leaves the cytoplasm has characteristic X bodies which are rounded structure. \\nFinger like projection arises from the cell walls of infected leaves. The mitochondria \\nand nuclei of infected cells become abnormal and the transmission of pathogen is by \\naphids. \\nCryptogram of Camv 0/2 : 5/15: 5/5: 5/ AP. \\nPOTATO VIRUS X (PVX) \\nPYX virus is distributed worldwide containing ssRNA as genetic material. There \\nare several strains of PYX developing different symptoms on different \\'Varieties of potato. \\nA large number of solonaceous plants like tobacco, datura, Solanum nigrum, egg plants, \\npepper, tomato etc can be infected by PYX. The infected tubers of potato transmit \\nthe virus particles which can remain alive about 5 months but can be inactivated at \\n74°C \\nPYX virus is also called as Solanu1Il virus, potato latent virus, mottle virus. The \\ninfected potato shows a wild mosaic between the veins on foliage. The infected plants \\nbecome dwarf and deformity in foliage occurs. The virus also causes top necrosis in \\ntubers. \\nStructurally PYX is a flexous rod in helical symmetry dimension ranging from 515 \\nx 11.2 nm capsid is made up of identical proteins subunit forming a helix of 3.3 nm, \\npitch and a hole of 3 nm diameter. Possibly a single subunit is associated with 3 or 4 \\nnucleotides. In India the PYX was first isolated in 1945 by Vasudeva and La!. \\nPYX spreads through rubbing, contact of plants and tubers, seed cutting, knife, farm \\nimplements, clothing and animal fur. In stores it can spread by sprout contact also. In \\nnature a wide range of PYX-infected plant species including weeds (Dahlia, Solanum sps) \\nserve as the source of virus infection. \\nTransmission is through sap. It spreads through contact between the healthy and \\ndiseased plant, core grafting and dodder. However it perennates in the diseased seed \\nstocks. Average tuber infection varies from 13-23%. PYX causes 10-30% yield loss. But \\nthe combined effect of PYX and PVY causes severe disease and reduce yield loss \\ndrastically.166 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nTRANSMISSION OF PLANT VIRUSES \\nPlant viruses are obligate parasites and to survive they must be spread from one \\nsusceptible host plant to another like other disease causing agents. The property of \\ntransmissibility is a fundamental characteristic of virus also. For years the transmission \\nof virus provided the only experimental evidence of its existence as an independent entity. \\nThe spread of virus or transmission of virus occurs in the following ways:-\\n(i) Mechanical transmission \\n(ii) Vegetative and graft transmission \\n(iii) Dodder transmission \\n(iv) Pollen and seed transmission \\n(v) Nematode and fungal transmission \\n(vi) Insect transmission \\n~~ \\nAphid Aphid feeding on leaf Aphid \\n(wingless) (winged) \\n~ Treehopper \\nLeafhopper \\n-Planthopper \\n~ Whitefly \\nPsylla \\ne\\'· \"~ .. \\n\\'.-\\nMealy bug \\nU[ ~ \\n5l . c:: . \\n·f Thrips \\n.r:. \\nPlant bug \\nBeetle Grasshopper \\no \\nFig. 5 : Insect vectors of plant viruses \\nThe organism who transport the virus from one plant to another is called vectors. \\nThey introduce viruse into plant tissues.

In humans the viral disease are known since the ancient times in India and \\nchina for example Small pox, Influenza, and common cold. Viral disease like small pox \\nwas linked to super natural causes and people used to perform offerings to goddess, \\'Shitala\\' \\nthroughout the country assuming that shitala had incarnated in the sufferers. Animal \\nviruses have the same type of components as plant and bacterial viruses. They have the \\nvirion or the virus particle made up of the viral capsid which is made up of protein \\ncontaining inside nucleic acid either DNA or RNA. The virus architecture is of two types \\nhelical (rod shaped, cylindrical) or icosahedral (spherical, quasispherical). For example the \\nadenovirus is icosahedral, where as rabies virus is bullet shaped. Unlike plant and bacterial \\nviruses the animal pathogenic virus contain an extra envelop outside the protein coat. This \\nenvelope is generally derived from the host cell membrane, but modified by insertion of \\nvirallyencoded glycoproteins and removal of host membrane protein during virus maturation. \\nThese enveloped viruses are sensitive to drying and treatment with acid and detergent. They \\nmust remain wet to retain membrane integrity and therefore must be transmitted through \\nblood, body fluids, respiratory droplets. The progeny particles of enveloped viruses are \\nreleased from the host cell by budding. Non-enveloped viruses are released by the lysis \\nof the host cell. They are resistant to drying and treatment with acid and alcohol. \\nREPLICATION OF ANIMAL VIRUSES \\nThe replication of animal viruses differ from phages in mechanism of entering the \\nhost cell (because they are eukaryotic and other is prokaryotic in nature). The steps in \\nthe process of reproduction is: \\n(i) Adsorption/ Attachment. \\n(ii) Penetration.170 \\n(a) Direct penetration. \\n(b) Fusion with plasma membrane. \\n(c) Endocytosis. \\n(iii) Uncoating. \\n(iv) Replication of viral nuclei acids. \\nTEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(v) Assembly of virus particles and Release of virus particle. \\n1. Adsorption! Attachment \\nThe virus particles get absorbed to the plasma membrane of the host cells by binding \\nto specific sites where the receptor proteins (usually glycoproteinsl are situated. The \\npresence of these receptor proteins is crucial in the viral infection and it may determine \\nhost resistance or susceptibility. The receptor proteins are usually surface proteins \\nnecessary for the host cell, as these proteins are also receptors for hormones and other \\nimportant molecules which get into the cell and are essential to the cell\\'s function. The \\nvirus mimics these essential molecules and manages to get into the cell by endocytosis. \\nMany host receptor proteins are related to immunolgobulins. For example HIV CD4 \\nreceptor, and the polio ICAM (intercellular adhesion molecule) receptor. In some cases \\ntwo or more cell receptors may be involved. The surface site on the viral particle will \\nbe an array of specific proteins. Envelope glycoproteins may also be involved in adsorption \\nin enveloped viruses. The herpes simplex virus has two glycoproteins that are involved \\nin adsorption. In adenoviruses, the projections extending from the corners of the capsid \\nplaya role in binding to host cell receptors. Spikes of some enveloped viruses also play \\nsimilar roles (myxovirus). For example, the influenza virus has two kinds of spikes, \\nhaemagglutinin, and neutraminidase. The haemogglutinin (H spike) attach to the host \\ncell receptor site and recognize siatic acid (N-acetyl neuraminic acid). The N spike \\n(Neuraminidase) helps the virus in penetrating the nasal and respiratory tract secretions \\nby degrading mucosal polysaccharides. However the receptor sites vary from person to \\nperson. \\n2. Penetration and Uncoating \\n(a) and (b) Direct penetration or fusion with plasma membrane \\nSome non-enveloped viruses such as the polio virus, undergo changes in capsid \\nstructure on adsorption to the plasma membrane, and release only their nucleic acids into \\nthe host cell. In the paramyxoviruses, and some other enveloped viruses, the capsids fuse \\nwith host cell plasma membrane. Fusion occurs between the envelope glycoprotins and \\nthe host plasma membrane proteins. Then the membrane lipids rearrange forming a \\nproteinaceous fusion pore. The nucelocapsid enters the host cell where uncoating take \\nplace. \\n(c) Endocytosis \\nEnveloped viruses may enter the host cell in another way. The virions attach to \\nspecialized regions on the membrane coated on the cytoplasmic side with protein clathrin. \\nThe coated regions pinch off to form coated vesicles filled with virus particles. The vesiclesTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 171 \\nfuse with lysosomes after the coating is removed. The lysosomal enzymes help in the \\nuncoating process. \\n3. Uncoating \\nThis is a process of separation of viral nucleic acid from the protein coat. This \\nprocess is not fully understood. In some viruses the coating is done by lysosomal enzymes \\nof the host cell which degrade protein coat and make the nucleic acid free in cytoplasm. \\nIn Pox virus the viral DNA synthesizes a specific protein after infection. Thus it varies \\nwith virus groups. \\n4. (i) Replication of DNA Viruses \\nThe genes which express early are the ones which are meant to execute host cell \\narrest. The virulent animal viruses arrest all the functions of the host cell such as DNA, \\nRNA and protein synthesis. The virus DNA replication usually takes place in the host \\nnucleus using host DNA polymerase-II, except in the poxviruses (such as vaccinia) whose \\ngenomes replicate in the cytoplasm. In most viruses, early transcription occurs using host \\nenzymes (polymerases) except in poxvirus where early mRNA is transcribed by a viral \\npolymerase. \\nThe genome of some viruses are too small to have enough genes for their replication \\n(e.g., Parvoviruses). The Parvovirus has the genome to code for three polypeptides which \\nare components of the capsid. The DNA of the virus is single stranded and linear. The \\nDNA being very small has to replicate in the host nucleus during the host DNA replication \\nusing the host DNA polymerases. This virus is usually associated with adenovirus and \\ncalled adeno-associated virus. Replication along with the adenovirus will help the virus \\nto replicate in a dependent way. \\nHepatitis-B virus (a number of Hepadnavirus group) is an enveloped virus with \\nan incomplete dsDNA genome. It has a genome replication strategy similar to that of the \\nretroviruses. Its genome is first completed and circularized in the cytoplasm, and \\ntransported to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the mRNAs are transcribed. Nucleocapsid is \\nassembled in the cytoplasm along with virally coded reverse transcriptase. The DNA is \\nsynthesized inside the virion by reverse transcribing RNA copies of the genome. \\nHerpesviruses are dsDNA viruses with icosahedral enveloped virions causing \\nimportant human and animal diseases. The genome-contains 50-100 genes. Upon \\nuncoating, the DNA is transcribed by the host RNA polymerase to form mRNAs to direct \\nthe synthesis of early proteins, the enzymes required for DNA replication, DNA replication \\ntakes place in the nucleus with the formation of virus-specific DNA polymerase. Host \\nDNA synthesis slows down. \\nPoxviruses (e.g., vaccinia) are the largest animal viruses known and are also most \\ncomplex. The double-stranded DNA contain\\'> around 200 genes. The virus enters through \\nendocytosis in coated vesicles. The central core of the virus contains DNA and DNA \\ndependent RNA polymerase that synthesizes the early mRNAs. DNA polymerases and \\nother enzymes needed for the DNA replication are also synthesized in the early part of \\nthe reproductive cycle, DNA replication begins about 1.5 hours after infection. After DNA172 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nreplication late mRNA transcription begins. Many late proteins are structural proteins \\nused in capsid formation. The complete reproductive cycle takes about 24 hours. \\nReplicative form \\n++ --=-+-\\nProgeny S +--~+-~ --... \\ngenomes~ \\nRelea!:-tt \\nAssembly \\n--....... \\nTranslation \\nViral protein \\n, \\nCleavage \\nRNA-dependentt t .*. \\nRNA polymerase ., \\nStructural \\nproteins \\nFig. 1 : Replication of positive single-stranded RNA viruses \\nTranscription Translation \\n-- +t \\\\ nl H\"-\\' ~.

The \\nantigenomic copy is now used as a template for the replication of the genome. The late \\nviral genes are transcribed from the viral genome, resulting in capsid proteins. \\nRetroviruses (e.g. HIV) have a positive sense RNA genome but employ a different \\nstrategy for genome replication as they first give rise to a complementary DNA molecule \\nby reverse transcription using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. The single stranded DNA \\ncopy serves as a template for the synthesis of a double stranded DNA (the provirus), by \\na cellular DNA polymerase. Provirus is then transcribed by the cellular enzymes to make \\nthe viral mRNA and viral genome RNA. \\nIn viruses with negative sense RNA (e.g., Orthomyxoviruses and Paramyxoviruses), \\nthe genome is associated with a RNA polymerases which transcribes an antigenomic copy \\nof the genome which is used as the template for virus genome replication. \\n5. Assembly and Release of Virus Particles \\nThe late expressing genes direct the synthesis of capsid proteins. Once enough \\nprotein and DNA are synthesized the two will spontaneous assemble to form virus \\nparticles, as in the case plant viruses. In icosahedral virus assembly, it appears that the \\nempty procapsids are first formed and then the nucleic acid is then inserted into the empty \\ncapsid in some unknown way. The assembly of enveloped viruses follows the same pattern \\nNucleocapsid --f\\'*~-=;--:CI \\nNaked icosahedral Enveloped icosahedral \\nNucleocapsid l~~~~.\"\\': \\nNaked nelical \\nEnveloped helical \\nFig. 5 : Symmetry of viruses: (a) icosahedral; (b) helicalTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 175 \\nexcept in the case of pox viruses which follow more complicated pattern and assemble \\nin the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. \\nThe mechanism of virion release differ between non-enveloped (naked) and enveloped \\nviruses. The virions of naked viruses are released by the lyse of the host cell. In the \\nenveloped viruses, the formation of the envelope and the release of the virus particle is \\na concurrent process. The viral capsid proteins are first attached to the plasma membrane, \\nand the nucleocapsid is formed on the membrane. The nucelocapsid is released by \\nmembrane budding, and the capsids carry the membrane in the process of budding and \\nreleased. Actin filaments of the host cytoskeleton can aid in virion release. \\nCLASSIFICATION \\nThe classification of animal viruses is based on the nature of the nucleic acids (DNA \\nor RNA, double stranded or single stranded linear or circular + or -strand), shape of \\nvirus particle, presence or absence of envelope and nature of disease caused. \\nBaltimore (1971) classified animal viruses in the following six groups according to \\nthe relationship between virion, nucleic acid and mRNA transcription. The RNA within \\nthe virion is known as (+) or sense strand because it acts as mRNA whereas newly \\nsynthesized RNA which is complementary in base-sequence to the original infectious \\nstrand is called minus (-) or antisense strand. It acts as template to produce additional \\n(+) strand which may acts as mRNA. \\nClass I dSDNA viruses \\nThe mRNA is synthesized on a dSDNA genome template (± dSPNA ~ (+) mRNA) \\nwhich usually occurs in a cell. Ex- Vaccinia virus, Adenovirus, Herpes simplex virus type \\nI and type II. \\nClass 2 SSDNA viruses \\nIn such viruses an intermediate DNA is synthesized before the synthesis of mRNA \\ntranscript (+ SSDNA ~ + mRNA). The mRNA has same polarity as the DNA. Ex\\xad\\nParvovirus, Mouse Minute virus. \\nClass 3 (+) SSRNA virus \\nThe RNA has similar polarity as the mRNA. Viruses of this class are grouped into \\ntwo classes. \\nSub class 3a: Individual mRNA encodes a polyprotein which is broken later on \\nto form viral protein. Ex- Poliovirus \\nSub class 3b: From (+) SSRNA two types of mRNA molecules are transcribed one \\nis of same length as virion RNA and the other is a fragment of virion e.g Dengu virus, \\nYellow fever and St. Louis Encephalites virus. \\nClass 4 (-) SSRNA \\nThe virion RNA is complementary to mRNA. They are divided mto two sub classes. \\n(a) Sub class 4a: The SSRNA genome encodes a series of monocistronic mRNA. \\nEx: Mumps virus, Measles virus.176 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(b) Sub class 4b: Each segment molecule of the genome acts as template for the \\nsynthesis of mRNA which are monocistronic or encodes polyprotein. Ex-Human influenza \\nvirus, Lassa virus. \\nClass 5 dSRNA viruses \\nAll the viruses of this class have segmented genome. Each chromosome encodes \\na single polypeptide. The dSRNA acts as template and asymmetrically synthesize (+) \\nmRNA. Ex- Reovirus of humans \\nClass 6 RNA-DNA viruses \\nIn these viruses (+) SSRNA directs the synthesis of (-) DNA which in turn acts \\nas template for the transcription of mRNA (RNA ~ (-) DNA 4 + RNA), Virion \\nRNA and mRNA are of the same polarity e.g.-Rous Sarcoma virus, Mouse leukemia \\nvirus. \\nClass 7 DNA- RNA virus \\nThis group consists of DNA containing hepatitis B viruses. \\nCharacteristics \\n1 \\nSingle-stranded \\nDNA, non-\\nenveloped \\nDouble-stranded \\nDNA, non-\\nenveloped \\nDouble-stranded \\nDNA, enveloped \\nViral family \\n2 \\nParvoviridae \\nAdenoviridae \\nTABLE 1 \\nClassification of Human Viruses \\nViral genus (with Dimensions Clinical or special features \\nrepresentative of virion \\nspecies) and Un- (Diameter \\nclassified members in nm) \\n3 4 5 \\nDepelldoviTlls 18-25 Depend on coinfection with \\nadenoviruses; cause fetal death, \\ngastroenteritis \\nMastadelloviTlls 70-90 Medium-sized viruses that cause \\n(adenovirus) various respiratory infections in \\nhumans; some cause tumors in \\nanimals. \\nPapovadridae PapillomaviTlls 40-57 Small viruses that induce tumors; \\n(human wart virus) the human wart virus (papilloma) \\nPolyolllaviTlls and certain viruses that produce \\ncancer in animals (polyoma and \\nsimian) belong to this family. \\nPoxviridae OrtilOpoxvims 200-350 Very large, complex, brick-shaped \\n(Vaccinia and viruses that cause diseases such \\nsmallpox viruses) as smallpox (variola), molluscum \\nMolIllScipOl:viTlls contagiosum (wartlike skin lesion), \\ncowpox, and vaccinia. \\nHerpesviridae Simp/exvirus (herpes 150-200 Medium-sized viruses that cause \\nsimplex viruses 1 various human diseases, such as \\nand 2) Varicellavirus fever blisters, chickenpox, shingles, \\n(varicella-zoster and infectious mononucleosis; \\nvirus) implicated in a type of human \\nContd ...THE ANIMAL VIRUSES \\n...

Enteroviruses \\nare among the most stable viruses. They can remain viable for years at -20°C or -70°C \\nand for months at 4°C. In faeces, at room temperature, the virus can remain infective for \\nseveral weeks. Being non enveloped they are insensitive to ether, chloroform and \\ndeoxycholate. The virus is readily killed by moist heat at 50-55°C, but in food stuffs the \\nvirus may survive exposure to 60°C and holder method of pasteurization. Enteroviruses \\nare rapidly inactivated by ultraviolet light, drying, formaldehyde (0.3%), hydrochloric acid \\n(0.1 M) or free residual chlorine (0.3-0.5 ppm). However, higher concentrations of chlorine \\nare necessary to inactivate virus in the presence of organic matter because the latter \\ndiminishes the activity of chlorine. \\nComposition: The RNA genome constitutes about one quarter of the virion. The RNA \\nis single stranded and of positive sense and can be translated directly by host ribosome. \\nThe capsid consist of a protein shell arranged in icosahedral symmetry around the RNA \\nmolecule. Four major peptides are reCOgnized in the shell VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4 and \\nare formed from a single precursor protein VP 0 by proteolytic cleavage. Specific neutralizing \\nantibodies are considered to be the major mechanism of protection against infection. \\nThe three groups of viruses those designated as enteroviruses have a number of \\nfeatures in common. \\n• They attach to cells in the intestinal tract by specific receptor sites and replicate \\nin cells of the intestinal tract. \\n• They commonly cause asymptomatic immunizing infections, which protect \\nagainst future infections with the same virus.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 181 \\n• They can give rise to viraemia. \\n• They occasionally cause infection of CNS and other target organs. \\n• They are commoner in children than adult. \\n• In temperate climate they cause infections usually in the summer and autumn. \\nPOLIOVIRUSES \\nOn the basis of neutralization tests, polioviruses can be divided into three serotypes. \\nType 1 is the common epidemic type, type 2 is usually associated with endemic infections \\nand type 3 occasionally causes epidemics. The size chemical properties and physical \\nproperties and resistance of the three types are all identical and so their antigenic \\nproperties provide one of the main method to differentiation. These viruses have affinity \\nfor nervous tissue and narrow host range. Only man and some primates like cynomologous \\nand rhesus monkeys are susceptible. These monkeys can be infected by the oral route \\nand develop paralysis. \\nConsiderable interest was generated in poliomyelitis after 1916 when more than \\n27,000 persons were paralysed and 6,000 died in a major epidemic in the USA which \\nhad mainly hit the adult population. \\nNatural infection occurs only in man. The virus is spread from man to man by faecal\\xad\\noral route and because early multiplication occurs in both the or9phanynx and the \\nintestinal mucosa, therefore, the virus is also spread by pharyngeal secretions (droplet \\ninfection) during first week of illness. No intermediate host is known. \\nOn entering the body of a new host the virus multiplies in then tonsils and peyer\\'s \\npatches of the ileum. Spread to regional lymph nodes (cervical and mesenteric) leads to \\na viraemia, enabling the virus to become disseminated throughout the body including cord \\nand brain. \\nPathogenesis \\n1. Neural spread may occur in children with inapparent infection at the time of \\ntonsillectomy. Poliovirus present in the orophanynx may enter nerve fibres \\nexposed during surgery and spread to brain resulting in bulbar paralysis. \\n2. A similar mechanism of viral spread via neural pathways may be responsible \\nfor paralysis of a limb recently injected with inflammatory injections such as \\ndiphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vaccine. This is probably associated with the \\nirritant properties of the adjuvant. \\n3. Pregnancy increases the incidence of paralysis. \\n4. Muscular activity during the paralytic phase of the illness may lead to paralysis \\nof the limbs used. \\nClinical Features \\nThere are three types of poliovirus infection: \\n(1) Asymptomatic or mild infection, transient \\'influenza like\\' illiness. The virus is182 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nexcreted in the faces for a limited time and an immunological response develops \\nwhich protect against re-infection with the same strain. \\n(2) Infection with same symptom and involvement of CNS with headache, fleck \\nstiffness and back pain (meningitis). Rapid and complete necessary is less than \\n10 days is usual. \\n(3) Paralytic poliomyelitis in which patient develops paralysis. This is very \\nuncommon, occurring in one in 1000 of polio virus infection in children. The \\nparalysis is flaccid due to destruction of lower motor neurons, although inv.asion \\nof the brain stem cells by virus can lead to inco-ordination of muscle groups \\nand painful spasms. Paralysis occur early in the illness but the extent is \\ninvariable. Damage to the nerve cells in the brain stem can lead to the inability \\nto swallow and breathe. \\nIn the CNS the virus multiples selectively in the neurons and destroy them. \\nProphylaxis \\nThe WHO had set a target date of the year 2000 as the global eradication of \\npoliomyletis. Although overall the number of cases has fallen more than 95%.30 countries \\nof South Asia and West and Central Africa has recent reports of the cases. A new dead \\nline has set to be 2005. The eradication has been attempted with annual national \\nimmunization days to ensure each child receives an adequate number of doses of oral \\npoliovaccine. \\nTwo effective vaccines are available: \\n• Inactivated polio vaccine (Salk), and \\n• Live attenuated oral polio vaccine (Sabin) \\nInactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) \\nIPV (Salk) for parental injection was developed by Jonas Salk in 1956. The vaccine \\ncontains formalin inactivated strains of the three serotypes of virus grown in monkey \\nkidney cell culture. The vaccine is given by deep subcutaneous or intra-muscular injection. \\nThree injection are given with intervals of 6-8 weeks between the first and second doses \\nand 4-6 months between the second and third doses. IPV produces long-lasting immunity \\nto all three poliovirus types. It is not associated with local or general reactions. The \\ninjection of this vaccine stimulates the production of IgG antibodies in the serum. It \\ndoes not induce detectable levels of secretory IgA in the gut and therefore would not be \\nexpected to prevent alimentary tract infections. Following infection, a virulent virus is \\nneutralized as it enters the blood stream, thus preventing involvement of the central \\nnervous system. The absence of live virus makes it safe to administer to immuno\\xad\\ncompromised individuals. \\nLive Attenuated Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) \\nOPV (Sabin) was developed by Albert Sabin in 1962. It contains live attenuated \\nstains of the three serotypes of poliovirus grown either in cultures of monkey kidney cellsTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 183 \\nor human diploid cells. The virus comprising the vaccine is unable to multiply in the \\ncells of the central nervous system and therefore lacks neurovirulence. The vaccine is \\nadministered orally and parallels natural infection. It stimulates both local secretory IgA \\nantibodies in the pharynx and alimentary tract and humoral IgG antibodies. Virus is \\nexcreted in the faeces for several weeks, during which time the vaccine may spread to \\nclose contacts, inducing or boostering immunity in them. \\nAt the age of one and a half months first dose of OPV is given along with DPT. \\nSecond, third and fourth doses of these vaccines are given at the ages of 21/ 2, 31/ 2 and \\n16-24 months, respectively. With multiple rounds of replication in the vaccine and after \\ntransmission to the contact, there is a theoretical possibility that the vaccine virus may \\nrevert to neurovirulence. The risk of vaccine-associated poliomyelitis has been estimated \\nat between 0.5 and 3.4 cases per million. OPV used in India is stated to contain Type \\n1 virus 10 lakh, Type 2 virus 2 lakh and type 3 virus 3 lakh, TCTD 50 per dose (0.5 \\nml). The shelf life of vaccine at 4-8°C is 4 months and at -20°C is 2 years. \\nCOXSACKI~VIRUSES \\nThese viruses were named so because the first isolation was made from Coxsackie \\nvillage in New York by Dalldrof and Sickles (1948). Based on the pathological changes \\nproduced in suckling mice, coxsackieviruses are classified into two groups, A and B. \\nTABLE 4 \\nCoxsackieviruses \\nGroup A \\nPathological changes induced by Generalized myositis \\nInoculation of suckling mice Flaccid paralysis \\nDeath within a week \\nNumber of types by 23 (1-24 except 23) \\nneutralization test \\nGroup B \\nPatchy focal myositis \\nSpastic paralysis \\nLocalized lesions in the \\nliver, pancreas, \\nmyocardium brain and \\nbrown fat pads. \\n6(1-6) \\nLike other enterovirues, coxsackievirues inhabit the alimentary canal primarily and \\nare spread by faecal-oral route. They may cause following lesions: \\nGroup A Viruses \\nCoxsackie A virus: Group A virus of which there are 24 serotype cause widespread \\nsever myosites of skeletal muscles and in life the mice appears to have a flaccid paralysis. \\nThe sign of infection appears 4 or 5 days after inoculation and progress until the animal \\ndies 4 or 5 days later. \\nCoxsackie B Virus: Group B virus of which there are six, cause widespread lesions \\nin many organs. The myositis produced is characterized by focal lesions and spastic184 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nparalysis. The virus cause areas of necrosis in the brown fat lobules, meningo-encephalitis \\nand pancreatis. The incubation period of B virus in mice is prolonged. \\nThese viruses give rise to: \\n1. Aseptic meningitis: It is caused by types 2, 4, 7 and 9. \\n2. Herpangina (vesicular pharyngitis): It is caused by types 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10. \\nIt is usually seen in young children. Outbreaks may be seen in nurseries and schools. \\nThere is an abrupt onset of fever and sore throat. The illness is self-limited. \\n3. Hand-foot and - mouth disease: It is usually caused by types 5 and 16 and \\nis predominantly a childhood illness. The disease presents as a painful stomatitis with \\na vesicular rash on the hands and feet. \\nGroup B viruses \\n1. Epidemic myalgia (Bornholm disease): It is so called because it was first \\ndescribed on the Danish island\\' of Bornholm. It is a febrile disease with stitch-like pains \\nin the muscles of the chest (intercostals), epigastrium or hypochondrium. lnvovlement of \\ndiaphragm leads to abdominal pain. \\n2. Myocarditis and pericarditis: Group B viruses may lead to severe and often fatal \\nmyocarditis in newborn infants. Myocarditis and pericarditis may also occur in children \\nand adults. \\n3. Aseptic meningitis: Group B viruses may cause aseptic meningitis sometimes with \\nparalysis. \\nEchoviruses \\nThese viruses were originally isolated from the faeces of persons who had no \\nclinical illness and caused a cytopathic effect in cell culture. Therefore, these viruses \\nwere given the name of enteric cytopahtogeneic human orphan viruses (echoviruses). \\nOn the basis of the presence of a type-specific neutralizing antigen in their capsid, \\nechoviruses have been sub-divided into 34 (1-34 except 10 and 28) types. All echoviruses \\ngrow well in human and simian kidney cultures. They infected only human beings \\nnaturally. \\nMost of the echoviruses produce asymptomatic infections but some have been \\nassociated with clinical syndromes such as aseptic meningitis, paralysis, fever with rash, \\nrespiratory disease (pneumonia, bronchiolitis and upper respiratory tract illness), infantile \\ndiarrhoea, pericarditis and myocarditis. \\nEchoviruses can be readily isolated from nose and throat swabs, stools or CSF on \\nhuman diploid embryonic lung fibroblast and human rhabdomyoisarcoma cell line.

Recently, the disease occurred in Mexico. AHC is \\nhighly infectious, has an incubation period of about 24 hours and the symptoms are \\nsudden swelling, congestion, watering and pain in the eyes. Although sub conjunctival \\nhaemorrhage is a characteristic feature, most cases recover in 3-7 days. Sometimes \\nenterovirus 70 may cause meningoencephalitis and paralysis. It can be isolated on human \\nembryonic kidney and HeLa cells. \\nRhinoviruses \\nThe common cold is probably the most common infectious disease of human. \\nRhinovirus term was applied to this group (rhino referring to \\'nose\\' the organ primarily \\naffected). \\nThey differ from enterovirus is being more acid labile, but more heat stable. They \\nare inactivated below pH 6. They are relatively stable at 20-37>C and may remain viable \\nfor days. Over 100 serotypes has been classified on the basis of their type specific antigen. \\nThe virus attaches to receptors on nasal ciliated epithelial cells, enters and replicates \\nwithin them spreading to other cells. \\nRhinoviruses are small RNA viruses, morphologically and biochemically similar to \\nother members of the family picomaviridae. They can be differentiated from the enteroviruses \\non the basis of their acid lability (thus their inability to infect the intestinal tract) and \\ntheir optimal temperature for replication (33°C). They are inactivated below pH 5. They \\nare relatively stable in temperature, range of 20-37°C and can survive on environmental \\nsurfaces such as door knobs for several days. Some rhinoviruses may survive heating at \\n50°C for 1 hour. They are resistant to 20% ether and 5% chloroform but are sensitive to \\naldehydes and hypochlorites. They can be preserved at -70°C. \\nSome strains grow in both monkey & human cell lins, these are designated as M \\nstrains and those which grow only in human cells are known as H strains. \\nPathogenesis \\nRhinoviruses are the major cause of common cold accounting for about half of all \\ncolds. Other viruses which may also cause common cold include corona viruses, some \\nenteroviruses particulary coxsackieviruses A21 and A24 and echoviruses 11 & 20,186 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nrespiratory syncytial virus, para influenza viruses and the low numbered adenoviruses. \\nRhinoviruses are transmitted by inhalation of droplets expelled from the nose of a patient \\nduring sneezing and coughing. During the acute phase of the illness high concentrations \\nof virus are present in nasal secretions which may contaminate hands, fingers, handkerchiefs \\nor paper tissues, door knobs, etc and the normal individuals who touch these, contaminate \\ntheir fingers which may touch the eye or nasal mucosa leading to cold. For rhinoviruses, \\nhand contact seems to be the prime mode of transmission. Rhinovirus infections are \\nobserved throughout the year, but the incidence of cold in temperate climates increases \\nin the autumn and spring and in the tropics the peak incidence occurs in the rainy \\nseason. \\nAfter an incubation period of 2-4 days, patient develops profuse watery discharge \\n(rhinorrhoea) with nasal obstruction, sneezing, sore throat, cough, headache, malaise and \\nlittle or no fever. On an average, symptoms subside in about a week but in a proportion \\nof the cases the symptoms may be prolonaged for 2 weeks or longer. Sinusitis or otitis \\nmedia may supervene, particularly if secondary bacterial infection occurs. The illness is \\ngenerally worse in smokers. Recovery is mediated by endogenous interferons, locally \\nsynthesized IgA antibodies and serum IgG antibodies. The multiplicity of serotype makes \\nvaccination impossible. Interferon is usually detectable shortly after the peak of virus \\nshedding and probably playa part in recovery. Pleconaril is one such drug showing \\nactivity against rhinovirus and enterovirus. Good infection control practices including \\nhand washing will reduce spread of infection in the hospital setting. \\nRHABDOVIRUS \\nThe family Rhabdoviridae consist of more than 200 viruses of vertebrate, invertebrate \\nand plants. It has two genera. Vesiculovirus and Lyssavirus. The member of genus \\nvesiculovirus causes vesicular stomatitis in horses, cattle, and pigs and only one of the \\n35 serologically distinct viruses of this genus causes human infection. The genus lyssa \\nvirus contain rabies virus and five rabies like viruses: Mokola, Lagosbat, Kotonkan, \\nObodhiang and Duvenhage viruses. Each of these viruses are capable of causing rabies \\nlike disease in domestic animals and humans. \\nThe bite of an infected animal like dog, cat, bat or skunk can transmit the disease \\nto man. \\nMorphology \\n(Rabies name come from the latin word rabidus = mad) \\nRabies virus is bullet shaped 180 x 75 nm with one end rounded conical and the \\nother plane or concave. The core of the virion consists of a minus sense 11-12 Kb. Single \\nstranded (-) RNA enclosed in helically wound nucleocapsid. RNA dependent RNA \\npolymerase enzyme (required for initiation of replication of virus) is enclosed within the \\nvirion in association with the ribonucleoprotein core. This ribonucleoproein core is \\nsurrounded by viral membrane or matrix protein which may be invaginated at the plane. \\nend. The matrix protein is again surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope which carries \\nglycoprotein peplomers (spikes). The spikes do not cover the plane end of the virion.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 187 \\nSymptoms \\nThe symptom in human include severe headache and high fever with alternating \\nstages of excitement and depression. Patients have difficulty in swallowing and slight \\nstimuli incite muscular spasms in the throat and chest. Death may occur due to convulsive \\nseizures. The mortality rate in untreated patients is nearly 100%. The course of disease \\nin humans can be classified into four stages-prodrome, acute encephalitic phase, coma \\nand death. The onset is marked by prodromal symptoms like fever, headache, malaise, \\nfatigue, and anorexia. An early symptom is often a neuritic type of pain or Paresthesia \\nand fasciculation at the site of virus entry. Apprehension anxiety, agitation, irritability, \\nnervousness, insomnia or depression characterise the prodromal phase, last for 2-4 days. \\nExcessive libido, priapism, and spontaneous ejaculation may occur rarely. \\nThe acute neurological phase usually begins with hyperactivity with bouts of bizarre \\nbehaviour, agitation or seizures appearing between apparently normal periods. \\nSome patients progress to paralysis. Death is due to respiratory arrest or other \\ncomplications. \\nAfter the bite of a rabid animal the incubation period is usually between 1-2 months. \\nHowever it may be as short as 9 days and rarely as long as a year or more. It is shorter \\nin children than in adults and also in person bitten on face or head than bitten on the \\nlegs. This is related to the distance the virus has to travel to reach \\'the brain. Patients \\ndevelops difficulty in drinking, together with intense thirst. Attempts to drink bring on \\npainful spasm of pharynx and larynx producing choking and gagging. Therefore mere \\nsight or sound of water precipitates distressing muscular spasm leading to hydrophobia \\n(fear of water). \\nThe furious form of rabies, gradually subsides into delirium, convulsions coma and \\ndeath. Sometimes only the dumb form is seen, with symmetrical ascending paralysis \\nfollowed by coma and death. The disease, once developed is almost always fatal in 4-\\n14 days. Rabies virus may be secreted in the saliva, urine and other secretions of human \\nrabies victims as in that of animals . \\n.\\' .>\\'~ _ ~ .~ _\\' _I ~..:..ll..\\\\.~~~ Lipoprotein envelope \\nf\\'~~O~ \\n- ~ .

Rabies \\nvirus is excreted in the saliva of affected animals. Man acquires infection by the bite of \\nrabid dog or other animals. Rarely infection can occur following licks on abraded skin \\nand intact mucosa. Infection has occurred through the inhalation of massive virus aerosle \\ngenerated in bat caves and in laboratory accidents. \\nInfection by bite of rabid animal results in deposition of rabies infected saliva deep \\nin the striated muscles. The virus replicates in the muscle cell or cells of epithelial tissues. \\nAfter reaching a sufficient concentration it infects peripheral nerves in the muscle or skin. \\nOnce within the nerve fibres it is out of reach of any circulating anti body and travels \\nalong the axon towards the central nervous system at a speed of 3 mm per hour. In the \\ncentral nervous system it multiplies and produces encephalitis. The virus then spreads \\noutwards along the nerve trunks to various parts of the body including the salivary glands. \\nIt multiplies in the salivary glands and is shed in the saliva. There is little evidence that \\nhaematogenous or other modes of spread are involved. \\nThe presence of virus in the saliva and the irritability and aggression brought on \\nby the enc~phalitis ensure the transmission and survival of the virus in nature. The virus \\nultimately reaches virtually every tissue in the body and is almost invariably present in \\nthe cornea and the skin of face and nape of the neck of the patient because of their \\nproximity to the brain. This provides a method for the antemortem diagnosis of rabies. \\nThe virus may also be shed in the milk and wine.ln humans the incubation period is \\n1-3 months or may be as short as 7 days or as long as three years. \\nExposure of humans to rabies virus does not necessarily result in .infection. Contrary \\nto popular belief, man is not highly susceptible to the virus. The incidence of human rabies \\nafter bites by known rabid dogs is about 15%. However, the incidence ranges from \\n1 % after contamination of minor wounds to more than 60% after severe bites on the \\nface. \\nIn dogs the incubation period is usually 3-6 weeks but it may range from 10 days \\nto a year. The initial signs are an alert, troubled air and a change in disposition with \\nrestlessness Snapping at imaginary object licking or gnawing at the site of the bite. After \\n2-3 days of this prodromal stage the disease, develops into either the furious or dumb \\ntype of rabies. In furious rabies (more common) the dogs runs amok, biting without \\nprovocation & indiscriminately. The lower jaws droops and saliva drools from the mouth. \\nParalysis, convulsions and death follow. In dumb rabies the animal lies huddled, unable \\nto feed. The dog may not bite but attempts to feed it are dangerous. About 60% of rabid \\ndogs shed the virus in saliva. Rabid dogs usually die in 3-5 days. \\nThe characteristic histopathological feature in rabies is the intracytoplasmic inclusion \\nbody (Negri body) in the neurons, most abundant in cerebellum and hippocampus. \\nNegribodies are composed of a finely fibrillar matrix and rabies virus particles. \\nPhysical and chemical properties: The virus is sensitive to ethanol, iodine \\npreparations, quarternayr ammonium compounds, soap, detergents and lipid solvents like \\nether chloroform and acetone. It is inactivated by phenol, formalion, UV radiation andTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 189 \\nsunlight. It dies at room temperature but can survive for weeks when stabilized by 50% \\nglycerol. It can be preserved at -700C by lyophilisation. \\nTransmission: The portal of entry from the infected saliva of a rabid animals are: \\n• abrasions or scratches on the skin. \\n• mucous membrane exposed to saliva from licks. \\n• most frequently via deep penetrating bite wounds uncommon routes include: \\n• inhalation while in bat infested areas/ caves \\n• aerosols released during centrifugation of infected material in the laboratory. \\n• ingestion of flesh of rapid animals. \\n• corneal transplants. \\n• Humans do not figure as spreaders of rabies. \\nEpidemiology \\nRabies virus is present in animals in all parts of the world except Australia and \\nAntartica, and some islands like Britain. Two epidemiological types of rabies exist-urban, \\ntransmitted by domestic animals like dogs and cats, and sylva tic, involving animals in \\nthe wild, such as jackals, wolves, foxes, mongooses, skunks and bats. Most cases of human \\nrabies follow dog bites but in endemic areas almost any animal can transmit rabies. In \\nIndia, antirabic treatment is to be considered following the bite of any animal except rats. \\nWhere urban or domestic rabies has been controlled, as in the USA, the majority of \\ninfections are due to bites by wild animals. \\nThe primary source of the rabies virus in nature seems to be in the mustelids and \\nviverrids, the ermine in the northern coniferous forests, the skunk, mink and weasel in \\nNorth America, the mottled pole cat in the USSR, the civet and pole cat in Africa and \\nthe mongoose in Asia. Rabies virus has been isolated repeatedly from the brain and \\nsalivary glands of apparently healthy wild rodents. The virus survives in this reservoir \\npopulation by achieving a state of latency with occasional activation such that only a \\nsmall proportion of them will be shedding the virus at anyone time. \\'From the reservoir \\nspecies, wild vectors such as foxes, wolves and jackals acquire the infection and \\noccasionally epizootics occur in these species. Carnivorous animals may acquire the \\ninfection by eating carcasses containing the virus. From these species the disease spreads \\nto dogs and other domestic animals. \\nAnother natural cycle of rabies concerns bats. A fatal paralytic disease of cattle & \\nhumans was noticed in Central and South America and the west Indies early in the \\ntwentieth century. This was identified as rabies only years later. The disease was shown \\nto be transmitted by vampire bats that sweep down on their prey at night. Vampire bat \\nrabies had taken a heavy toll of cattle. Vampire bats may shed the rabies virus as \\nsymptomless carries over a period of several months. \\nRabies is ehdemic in India. It has been estimated that more than 30,000 people die \\nof rabies in India every year and more than 700,000 receive antirabies vaccine. Human \\nrabies can be checked by control of rabies in domestic animals, by registration, licensing190 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nand vaccination of pets and destruction of stray animals. With the dog population in \\nIndia estimated as over 16 million, the problem is immense. However, rabies can be \\neliminated only if the wild vectors such as jackals and foxes, and the reservoir mustelids \\nand viverrids are controlled. Rabies has been eliminated from islands like Britain and \\nJapan by rigid quarantine. Australia which has no native mustelid or viverrid population \\nhas no rabies. Eradication of rabies from countries like India with abundant wildlife may \\nnot be practicable. \\nVaccination \\nPasteur introduced vaccination after exposure to rabies in 1885 on the basis that \\na long incubation period should allow time for immunity to develop before the onset of \\nsymptoms. His vaccine was a crude extract of rabbit spinal cord containing virus \"fixed \\nas a result of serial passage. A well publicized early success established the procedure, \\nstill in use despite various vicissitudes. A phenolized brain suspension formed the basis \\nof the sample vaccine, used in the UK from 1919 until 1966. Its drawbacks included a \\nvariable but generally low potency, which necessitated a considerable number of daily, \\noften painful, injections, with an antibody response mainly of the IgM class. There was \\nalso the disadvantage that the amount of myelin in its nervous tissue content sensitized \\na proportion of those being immunized, estimated to range from 1 in 500 upwards so \\nthat many went on to develop an allergic type of encephalomyelitis. When the risk of \\na possible exposure to a rabid animal was assessed as only marginal, it was matter of \\ndebate whether the risk of rabies was greatest than the risk of allegric encephalomyelitis. \\nA suckling mouse brain vaccine was developed and contains much less myelin. \\nIt is claimed to have a five fold reduction or more in the incidence of allegric \\nencephalomyelitis, and is widely used in latin American countries. A non-neurogenic duck \\nembryo vaccine was used in the UK from, 1966 to 1976. A purified version has shown \\nincreased potency, but this vaccine has been superseded by cell culture vaccines, of which \\nthere are several types. Those available worldwide, through not necessarily used because \\nof their high cost, include: \\n• diploid cell vaccine \\n• rabies vaccine adsorbed \\n• purified chick embryo cell vaccine \\n• vero cell vaccine \\nThese all have good immunogenicity and safety. \\nThe diploid cell vaccine is the only one licensed in the UK for\\'both pre and post \\n-exposure prophylaxis and is the only vaccine recommended for intradermal administration. \\nSevere reactions are rare after use, though upto 20% may report minor local effects, and \\na smaller proportion report systematic, influenza-like or sensitization effects. Intradermal \\nvaccine is not recommended while antimalarials are in use because these may interfere \\nwith the immune response. Immuno-suppressed persons may show a poor response and \\nshould have antibody levels checked. \\nSeveral vaccine types and modes of delivery have been used in animals. Those usedTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 191 \\nin dogs and cats are given intramuscularly, and require boosting every 1-3 years \\ndepending on the vaccine type. Attempts have been made to control the infection in wild \\nanimals by the use of live-attenuated vaccines delivered orally. By carefully selecting \\ndesirable baits, such as chicken heads for foxes, successful vaccination programmes have \\nbeen carried out in several European countries. \\nWork continues on a number of recombinant and subunit vaccines, and an \\nalternative antibody preparations to use in humans. \\nControl \\nBecause rabies has a world wide distribution its complete elimination would need \\nthe eradication of infection from all susceptible animal species. First steps in this direction \\nhave been the use of vaccine-impregnated baits to reduce rabies in foxes in Europe and \\nCanada and Raccoons in the USA. Since most human exposure has resulted from contact \\nwith infected dogs and cats, vaccination of domestic dogs and cats combined with post\\xad\\nexposure prophylaxis for those exposed in specific incidents to suspect rabid animals and \\npre-exposure for those who may come in contact with such animals in the course of their \\nwork has reduced the number of human cases in many countries. Pre-exposure vaccination \\nis recomm~ded for the following groups: \\n• Laboratory workers handling the virus \\n• Those handling imported animals at animal quarantine centres, zoos, research \\ncentres and ports. \\n• Veterinarians and their technical staff \\n• Animal health inspectors \\n• Licensed bat handlers \\n• Travelers to enzootic areas if work involves handling animals or patients with \\nrabies. \\n• Those traveling more than a day\\'s journey from modern medical treatment. \\nPre-exposure immunization requires two injections of 1 ml of vaccine, given into \\nthe deltoid muscle 4 weeks apart. A test for neutralizing antibody is advised 4 weeks \\nlater. A re-inforcing dose is given at 12 months. A booster should be given after any \\npotential exposure. Those at high risk of exposure should have periodic antibody testing \\nand boosting as required every 6 months to 2 years. \\nClear signs of case reduction have come from the developed countries that have \\napplied this scheme, and now the need is to extend the procedure to other, particularly \\nenzootic, regions where dogs are the major reservoir of the virus. Past attempts to control \\nwild life rabies by such draconian measures as shooting and gassing have had short\\xad\\nlived effects. Species vary in their susceptibility to rabies and live vaccine strains that \\nmay be used for one species may be unsuitable for another. Extension to canine and other \\nspecies may become feasible when suitable oral vaccine strains are identified. A number \\nof vectors, such as vaccinia, raccoon pox virions, fowl pox, canary pox and adenovirus, \\nhave been used to express a recombinant rabies glycoprotein gene with successful \\ninduction of neutralizing antibody in a variety of animal species.192 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nROTA VIRUSES \\nRotavirus infections are usually mild to moderately severe in developed countries \\nbut can become very severe and cause high mortality in developing countries. Rotavirues \\nalso cause diarrhoea in the young of a wide variety of mammals and birds. In the early \\n1980s, a rotavirus (adult diarrhoea rotavirus, ADRV) was identified as the cause of \\noutbreaks of diarrhoea in children and adults in different parts of China. \\nMorphologically, rotaviruses are polyhedrons of 75 nm diameter displaying \\ncharacteristic sharp-edged double-shelled capsids, which in electron micrographs look like \\nspokes grouped around the hub of a wheel. The name \\'rotavirus\\' was derived from this \\nappearance which is pathogenomic. More detailed structural studies have shown that \\nthe double-shelled capsid is penetrated by a large number of channels and that it \\ncarries on the surface of 60 protrusions that consist of dimers of VP4 (viral protein 4) \\nmolecules. \\nThe genome of rotaviruses is located inside the inner core and consists of 11 \\nsegments of double-stranded RNA that can be easily extracted from viruses and separated \\nby polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All segments, except one, code for only one virus\\xad\\nspecific protein (VP), and gene-protein assignments have been completed for several \\nrotavirus strains. \\nRNA segments 1, 2 and 3 code for the inner core proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3, \\nrespectively: VP2 is the main scaffolding protein (core layer). RNA segment 6 codes for \\nthe inner capsid protein, VP6 which forms a middle layer interacting with the core protein \\nVP2 and the outer capsid proteins. VP6 carries epitopes specifying groups & sub groups. \\nSo far, seven different groups (A-G) have been identified. For groups A-E complex lack \\nof serological cross-reactivity has been proven. Within a group, all viruses share common \\nVP6 antigens but may be further differentiated into sub groups. Thus, within group A \\nthere are at least four subgroups (I, II, I + II, non - I, non - II), which are identified by \\nspecific antisera and monoclonal antibodies. Most of the human rotavirues are of group \\nA; the Chinese ADRV is a group B; group C rotaviruses cause occasional outbreaks in \\nhumans. The outer capsid (third layer) is formed by two proteins, VP7 a glycoprotein \\n(encoded by RNA, 7, 8 or 9 depending on strain), and VP4 (encoded by RNA 4). Both \\nsurface proteins carry neutralization -specific epitopes that define serotypes. VP4 is post\\xad\\ntranslationally cleaved into the VP5 and VP8 subunits; proteolytic cleavage is essential \\nfor infectivity. Six non-structural proteins (NSP1-NSP6) are coded for by RNAs 5, 7, 8 \\nor 9 (depending on strain), 10 and 11 (encoding NSP5 + NSP6), and have various functions \\nduring replication, mainly in morphogenesis. \\nSo far, 14 different VP7-specific serotypes (G types, derived from glycoprotein) and \\nover 20 different VP4- specific types (P types, derived from protease-sensitive protein) have \\nbeen distinguished. Whilst the correlation between G serotypes and genotypes is complete, \\nnot all P types have been confirmed as serotypes yet, and therefore the P serotype \\ndesignation differs from the P genotype designation, e.g., strain Wa being designated as \\nA/human/Wa(GIP1A[8]) etc. As VP7 and VP4 are coded for by different RNA segments, \\nthey can segregate independently, and a large variety of different G-P-type combinations \\nof rotaviruses have been observed after reassortment in vitro and in nature in vivo. AnimalsTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 193 \\nfrom which rotavirus can be readily isolated are cattle, sheep, horses, pigs, dogs, cats and \\nmice, but also elks, rabbits, monkeys and many others. \\nElectrophoresis of genomic RNA segments (PAGE) has been used to establish so\\xad\\ncalled \\'electropherotypes\\' of rotavirus isolates. Besides \\'long\\' and \\'short\\' electropherotypes \\n(differing in the rates of relative migration of RNA segments 10 & 11). Various minor \\ndifferences in the migration of corresponding segments have been recognized. These \\ndifferences have been utilizing extensively in epidemiological studies, but for many \\nsurveillance purposes and for vaccine development serological classification remains \\nessential. \\nPathogenesis and Immunity \\nRotaviruses replicate exclusively in the differentiated epithelial cells at the tips of \\nthe villi of the small intestine. New virus is produced after 10-12 h. Progeny virus is \\nreleased in large numbers into the intestinal lumen ready to infect other cells. Biopsies \\nshow atrophy of the villi with reactive crypt hyperplasia and lymphocytic infiltrates in \\nthe lamina propria. The cellular damage leads to malabsorption of nutrients, electrolytes \\nand water and the crypt hyperplasia to hypersecretion. An osmotic and secretory diarrhoea \\nwith vomiting and dehydration results. It has been established that the product of RNA \\n4, VP 4, holds a central position for replication, spread and pathogenicity of rotaviruses, \\nbut that products of other RNA segments also contribute to the development of disease. \\nIn particular NSP4 (encoded by RNA segment 10) has been recognized as a viral \\nenterotoxin. \\nThe infection is followed by a local, humoral and cell-mediated immune response \\nand is normally overcome within a week. Rotavirus-specific IgA enteric antibodies, which \\nare secreted into the gut, are the best known correlate of protection. Infection with one \\nserotype provides homotypic, and re-infection leads to partial heterotypic, protection. In \\nthe immunodeficient host, however, a persistent infection can occur with severe chromic \\ndiarrhoea. \\nClinical Symptoms \\nThe onset of symptoms is abrupt after a short incubation period of 1-2 days. \\nDiarrhoea and vomiting are seen in the majority of infected children and last for 2-6 days. \\nAlthough symptoms of respiratory tract infection are frequently observed at the time of \\nrotavirus infections, there is no evidence that rotaviruses replicate in the respiratory tract. \\nClinical symptoms can range from mild to very severe, in part depending on the rotavirus \\nstrain. Asymptomatic infections of neonates with \\'nursery strains\\' are not uncommon. It \\nhas been estimated that about half of all gastro-enteritis cases\\' in children requiring \\nadmission to hospital are caused by rotaviruses. Infection has been detected in older \\nchildren and adults, but is usually asymptomatic. Only in the elderly have outbreaks of \\ndiarrhoea due to rotavirus infection been observed. Rotavirus infections can be life\\xad\\nthreatening if children are already malnourished. Five million children under the age of \\n2 years die from diarrhoeal disease in developing countries each year, rotavirus infections \\naccount for about 20% of these deaths.194 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nEpidemiology \\nRotavirus infections occurs world wide. Most symptomatic infections are seen in \\nchildren under 2 years of age; by the age of 3 years, more than 90% of children have \\nbeen infected by most of the major serotypes. In family outbreaks there may be evidence \\nof sub clinical infection in older children and adults who may be the source of infection \\nfor young children in family or nursery outbreaks. The release of enormous numbers of \\nvirions during the \\'acute stage contributes to the easy transmission of the virus. Only a \\nfew virus particles are sufficient to cause disease in the susceptible host. Longer-lasting \\noutbreaks may be maintained by the ability of the virus to survive outside the body for \\nsome time. In temperate climates there is a pronounced seasonal incidence, with peaks \\nin the winter months occurring with \\'clock wise precision\\'. In tropical areas infections \\noccur evenly throughout the year. \\nVarious surveys in different parts of the world have shown that at any time there \\nis co-circulation of genomic ally and serologically different rotaviruses. In tropical and \\nsubtropical regions, high prevalence of G/P constellations are seen which are rare in \\ntemperate climates (e.g., G8P[6], G9P[11], G9P[6] viruses have recently emerged in a \\nnumber of countries of several continents). \\nAt the molecular level, several factors have been identified that can explain the \\ngenomic and antigenic variability of co-circulating rotavirus strains: \\n• Like the genomes of other viruses that depend on virion-associated, RNA\\xad\\ndependent RNA polymerases for their replication, rotavirus genomes undergo \\nfrequent point mutations that accumulate in time and give rise to lineages an,d \\nsub lineages. \\n• Rotaviruses, like other segmented RNA viruses, undergo extensive reassortment \\nin doubly infected cells. This has been shown to occur both in vitro and in vivo. \\nIf RNA segments coding for sub groups and serotype-specific proteins are \\ninvolved, antigenic shift can occur in reassortants. \\n• Rotaviruses may be transferred into humans from animal species, and this may \\ncontribute to the genomic variability. Human group A rotavirus isolates have \\nbeen described, the genome of which is very closely related to that of cat and \\ncattle rotaviruses. ADRVs of group B may have been derived recently from \\nanimals, perhaps rats. On the other hand, human group C rotaviruses are \\nsignificantly different from animal group C rotaviruses. \\n• Rotaviruses establishing chronic infections in immunodeficient hosts undergo \\nvarious forms of genome rearrangements, resulting in highly atypical RNA \\nprofiles. Evidence is now emerging that such rearrangements may occur more \\nfrequently than originally thought. \\n• Various combinations of these factors may occur e.g. reassortment of viruses \\nwith rearranged genomes, or point mutations combined w~th reassortment, \\nTreatment and Control \\nTherapy consists mainly of oral, sometimes intravenous, rehydration with fluids ofTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 195 \\nspecified electrolyte and glucose composition. Antimotility drugs (codein phosphate, \\nloperamide) are generally not advised for use in children, but recently developed \\nenkephalinase inhibitors (e.g. racecadotril) which decrease gut secretion but not motility \\nhave been given successfully to children. \\nAs with any infectious agent transmitted by the faecal-oral route, attention to \\nhygienic measures such as hand washing and disinfection of contaminated surfaces and \\nsafe disposal of faeces are very important. \\nFor a variety of reasons, rotavirus infections have so far resisted prevention by \\nwidespread vaccination. Co-circulation of several serotypes at a time occurs in populations \\nat risk, which is also reflected in poly typic serum antibody responses. Furthermore, it is \\nnot fully clear to what extent vaccination with one rota virus serotype cross-protects against \\nother serotypes. However , polyvalent \\'cocktail\\' vaccines containing two or more different \\nserotypes have been shown to have a significant effect on prevention severe disease. One \\nof them, a rhesus rotavirus-based tetravalent human reasortant vaccine (RRV -TV, \\nRotashiled™), had been licensed in the USA in 1998 for universal use, and over 1.5 million \\ndoses (three doses per child at the ages of 2, 4 and 6 months) were administered over \\nthe following year. However, the vaccine had to be revoktd and taken off the market when \\na strong epidemiological link between application of the first (and second) dose of the \\nvaccine and the development of gut intussuspcetion became apparent. \\nA nUIllber of different candidate vaccines of live-attenuated rotavirus of bovine or \\nhuman origin, including bovine rotavirus monreassortants carrying human VP7 genes of \\ndifferent serotypes, are currently being evaluated. Baculovirus-expressed virus-like particles, \\nDNA-based vaccines and micro-encapsidated viral proteins or cDNAs are also being \\nexplored. It is hoped that (an) efficient rotavirus vaccine(s) will become available in the \\nnot too distant future. \\nACQUIRED IMMUNE \\'DEFICIENCY SYNDROME; LYMPHOMA HIV VIRUS \\nVirions of the family Retroviridae possess reverse transcriptase enzyme hence the \\nname (Re: reverse, tr: trnscriptase) The family retroviridae has been .divided into 3 sub \\nfamilies of the seven genera included in this family three contain human retroviruses. \\nHuman T celllymphotrophic virus Type 1 (HTLV-l) is an oncogenic virus. It causes adults \\nT cellieukaemia/iumphoma . HTLV-2 is prevalent in intravenous drug users, but has not \\nbeen associated with disease. They have been studied in the laboratory for many years, \\ninitially because some are associated with tumour production in their natural hosts. \\nIndeed, a wide variety of tumours are caused by the oncovirus genus, including leukaemias \\nand lymphomas, sarcomas, breast and brain tumours, auto-immune disease and blood \\ndisorders. The host species include birds, mice, cattle, pigs and several primates. Despite \\nintense effort, it was not until 1980 that the first human retrovirus was isolated from the \\nT cells of patients with T cell leukaemia-the human T lymphotropic virus type-lor HTLV-\\n1. Since then, the cause of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been \\nshown to be a retrovirus, also with a predilection for T cells but differing significantly \\nfrom HTLV-l . It is known as the human immuno deficiency virus type lor HIV-l . Infection \\nwith this virus has become pandemic and is a major cause of mortality in sub-saharan196 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nAfrica and other developing countries. Infection with the related HIV-2 is restricted largely \\nto west Africa and shows a lesser pathogenicity. Viruses that produce tumours in their \\nnatural hosts or in experimental animals, or induce malignant transformation of cells on \\nculture are known as oncogenic viruses. \\nAll retroviruses have an outer envelope consisting of lipid and viral proteins; the \\nenvelope encloses the core, made of other viral proteins, within which lie two molecules \\nof viral RNA and the enzyme reverse transcriptase, an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. \\nThe virions have a diameter of about 100 nm and, in thin section, differences can be seen \\nin the appearance of the core; those with a central condensed structure are known as \\ntype C particles while those with an eccentric bar structure are type D particles. \\n~ ____ gp120 \\n.A\\'eJ~fL. \\n~~\\':ct:Jr:o::Qi~~M--- gp41 \\n\"e:\\'IItft\\'-:lIIr---P 17 \\ni--~!!--- p24 \\n.rf----iH-~~----- RNA \\n\\\\..(\"\"l::::\\'~t\"to.,l-#.\"\".It-- Reverse \\ntranscriptase \\n~tb.,;;,;~~ l1II~-\\'~--- Lipid bilayer \\nFig. 7 : Electron micrograph of HIV \\nResistance \\nHIV is a delicate virus. It is thermolabile being inactivated at 50°C in 10 min and \\nin second at 100°C. It cannot survive outside the living host. However the live virus has \\nbeen reported to survive within blood upto 8 days. It is susceptible to common disinfectants \\nbecause of its lipid membrane envelope it is highly susceptible to detergents. \\nHIV is inactivated in contaminated medical instruments. \\n• heat, in the autoclave or hot air oven \\n• glutaraldehyde 2 % \\n• hypochlorite (10,000 ppm); 1 in 10 dilution of domestic bleach \\n• other disinfectants, including alcohols. \\nThe chemicals will inactivate at least 105 units of virus within a few minutes, but \\nit is important to remember that disinfectants are inactivated in the presence of organic \\nmaterial. \\nThe survival of HIV has been investigated. It has been shown that: \\n* virus may survive for upto 15 days at room temperature.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 197 \\n* at 37°C virus can su.rvive for 10-15 days \\n* over 60°C virus is inactivated 100-fold each hour. \\nThese are the limits of survival. However, the results underline the need for \\ncleanliness and disinfection when dealing with blood and infected secretions. \\nClassification \\nThe family Retroviridae was originally divided into the sub families Oncovirinae, \\nSpumavirinae and Lentivirinae, based on their biological properties and appearance in \\ncell cultures. However the availability of nucleotide sequences from a large number of \\nhuman and animal retroviruses has indicated that viruses referred to as oncoviruses \\nbelong to several distinct groups. In the new classification of retroviruses there are five \\ngroups, including two corresponding to the original lentiviruses and spumaviruses, a \\ngroup containing HTLV-1 and II and the BID group that contains a number of oncogenic \\nviruses from other animals. \\nThe human viruses HTLV-1 and HTLV-II are related to the simian viruses STLV-\\n1 and II that are widely distributed in old and New world monkeys . In common with \\nHTLV-I, they can cause lymphomas in some primates. \\nMorphology \\nHIV is a spherical enveloped virus, about 90-120 nm in diameter with a three layer \\nstructure. In the centre are two identical copies of ssRNA (9.2 kb each) associated with \\nreverse transcriptase and surrounded by an icosahedral capsid,. which in turn is \\nsurrounded by a matrix protein followed by a host cell membrane derived lipid bilayer \\nenvelope from which project 72 glycoprotein peplomers. The genome organization is \\nsimilar for all retroviruses in that their genomes contain in the same order the genes gag, \\npol and env, which code for the three groups of structural protein. The long terminal repeat \\nsequences (LTR) at both ends of the genome contain promoter and enhancer sequences. \\nThere are important differences between the types in the nature and arrangement of the \\ngenes involved in the regulation of the replication cycle. The genome of HIV contains three \\nmajor genes each coding for two or more polypeptides. The gag (group specific antigen) \\ngene encodes the core or capsid and matrix proteins, the pol gene encodes the reverse \\ntranscriptase (polymerase) and the env gene encodes the virion envelope peplomer protein \\nand transmembrane protein. HIV-1 is divided into 3 groups. HIV-1M (major group), HIV-\\n10 (outlier) and HIV-IN (new virus). HIV-IM comprises eight sub types or clades, \\ndesignated A,B, C, D, F, C, Hand J as well as four major circulating recombinant forms \\n(AE, AC, ACI, AB) India predominantly has HIV-1M sub type C. Sub types A and Bare \\nless frequent. However western developed countries have HIV-1M sub type B as predominant \\nsub type. Sub type C is usually acquired by heterosexual contact and subtype B by \\nhomosexual contact. HIV-2 has been divided in 5 sub types (A to E). There are at least \\nsix regulatory genes in HIV and at least two in HTLV-1. In HIV, tat codes for a protein \\nthat has a general stimulating effect on the synthesis of all viral proteins through its \\nbinding to a region in the LTR that promotes transcription of viral mRNAs. The rev gene \\nproduct has a regulatory effect, switching on viral protein synthesis by favouring the \\nproduction of full-length RNA molecules rather than the spliced RNA from the regulatory198 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\ngenes. There is evidence that the product of other transactivating genes such as that of \\ncytomegalovirus, can also act on the same sequence within the LTR of HIV. The four \\nproteins coded for by the gag gene of HIV are all found in the virion. The pol gene products \\nare a protease, endonuclease, integrase and reverse transcriptase. The env gene codes for \\na large protein that is glycosylated and cleaved to gp 41, the transmembrane protein and \\ngp 120, the external envelope glycoprotein present on the envelope as a trimer with many \\nglycosylation sites. Both HIV-1 and -2 show considerable sequence variability, which has \\nallowed their classification into a ilumber of sub types that show marked difference in \\ngeographical distribution and association with different risk groups. HIV variants are \\ncurrently classified into at least eight subtypes (A-H) that differ from each other by \\n20-30% in nucleotide sequence. In addition, in areas with more th~n one subtype in \\ncirculation, viruses with recombinant genomes have been described. \\nReplication \\nRetroviruses differ from other RNA viruses in that they replicate and produce viral \\nRNA from a DNA copy of the virion RNA. The best studied method of attachment of \\nHIV to cells is by the interaction of the external envelope glycoprotein gp 120 with part \\nof the CD4 molecule of T helper lymphocytes and other cells. Attachment is followed by \\ninteraction of tlle HIV envelope with a second (co-) receptor. Membrane proteins used by \\nHIV-1 and -2 in this second step include the chemokine receptors, CCR5 and CXCR4. \\nThese are expressed on a wide range of lymphoid and non-Iumphoid cells, whose ligands \\nare chemotactic cytokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein -1 a involved in \\ninflammatory responses. After this second binding step, entry of the virus occurs by fusion \\nof the viral envelope with the cellular membrane, a step that requires exposure of a \\nhydrophobic domain in gp 41. once the RNA is released into the cytoplasm, the reverse \\nL Viral RNA \\nup \\np55 p100 gp160 \\n11\\\\ protea(l~donuclease / \\\\ \\np17 p24 p7.p9 Reverse gp120 gp41 \\ntranscriptase \\nFig. 8 : The genomic organization of HIV structural genes and their protein products \\ntranscriptase acts to form the double-stranded DNA copy, which is circularized, enters \\nthe nucleus and is spliced into the host cell DNA.

Test for HIV antibodies are usually negative at the onset of the illness \\nbut become positive during its course. Therefore acute HIV infection is also known as \\nseroconversion illness. \\n(1) The acute seroconversion illness resembles glandular fever, with adenopathy and \\nflu-like symptoms .

Infection is not transmitted \\nby travelling in a bus or a train with an AIDS patient, sharing public telephone, toilets, \\ncooking and eating facilities or by the bite of mosquitoes, bed bugs or other blood sucking \\ninsects. Infection is not transmitted through air, food, water, fomites or by donating \\nblood. \\nUrine, faeces, sweat, milk, bronchialveolar lavage fluid, amniotic fluid and synovial \\nfluid have been reported to yield zero or a few HIV particles. Therefore, these are not \\nimportant in HIV transmission. Saliva in adults contains some nonspecific inhibitory \\nsubstances like fibronectins which can prevent cell to cell transfer of virus. This saliva \\nis not a likely vehicle of transmission of HIV.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 203 \\nReplication of HIV \\nHIV attaches via its gp 120 envelope glycorprotein (surface spike) to the CD4 antigen \\ncomplex which is the primary HIVreceptor on CD4+ (helper/inducer) T lymphocytes and \\ncells of the macrophage lineage. The CD4 molecule has binding avidity for gp 120 of HIV. \\nThen by pinocytosis, the nucleocapsid of the virion enters into host cell. The envelope \\nof the same does not enter into the cell. After entry into the cell, the nucleocapsid releases \\nits RNA into the cytoplasm. The viral reverse transcriptase, acting as an RNA dependent \\nDNA polymerase, makes a DNA copy of the genomic RNA. The ssDNA is made double\\xad\\nstranded by the same enzyme, now acting as a DNA-dependent DNA- polymerase. \\nThis dsDNA moves to the nucleus and several such molecules become integrated \\nas provirus at random sites in the host cell chromosome causing a latent infection. The \\nintegrated provirus is transcribed by cellular RNA polymerase II either for the production \\nof mRNAs which are translated into proteins or for the production of genomic RNA for \\ninsertion into progeny virions. \\nHIV establishes a latent infection with or without an initial productive phase. In \\nthis state, the integrated proviral DNA remains silent without transcription or expression \\nof most viral proteins. Certain factors, however, can activate the virus and convert the \\nlatent state into productive HIV infection. During viral replication, naked virus buds from \\nthe surface qf the infected cell and acquires a lipoprotein envelope which contains lipid \\nderived from the host cell membrane and glycoproteins which are virus-encoded. \\nPathogenesis \\nSince HIV infects cells expressing CD4 antigen, therefore, in the circulation the virus \\nis found in CD4+ T lymphocytes and also in monocyte-macrophage cells, which may act \\nas a reservoir for virus. Macrophage are also important in carrying the virus into the central \\nnervous system across the blood-brain barrier. Virus is also present in the plasma. It is \\nprobably derived from the lysis of activated lymphocytes. Within one month or so, viraemia \\ndeclines to a near undetectable level and illness subsidies. This is brought by CD8+ \\ncytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and antibody-dependent cell-mediated \\ncytotoxicity (ADCC). \\nThis is followed by a long asymptomatic period of 1-15 years (average 10 years). \\nDuring this period, only a small number of circulating CD4+ cells are producing virus \\nand only low titres of virus are present in the blood. However, many infected cells can \\nbe detected in the lymph nodes. Follicular hyperplasia develops in these and other \\nlumphoid organs. When CD4+ T cell count falls below 400/ ilL, a large number of virions \\nspill over from the degenerating lymph nodes into the blood and opportunistic infections \\nwith various microorganisms may develop. Cause of death is the opportunistic infections, \\nmalignancy and cachexia-like state. Fall in CD4+ T cell count is d~e to: \\n1. Viral cytolysis of CD4+ T cells. \\n2. Infected CD4+ T cell can fuse, via. gp 120, with up to 100 uninfected CD4+ \\nT cells forming a unit called syncytium. This will lead to the death of the entire \\nunit.204 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n3. Immune cytolysis of infected T cells by cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, ADCC and \\nantibody/complement-mediated lysis. \\n4. HIV may also infect stem cells, so that there is no replacement. \\n5. AIDS may be a autoimmune disease, causing autoimmune destruction of \\ninfected CD4+ T cells. \\nThe helper cells (CD4+ T cells) provide positive signal to B cells so that they can \\nproduce specific antibody and cytotoxic or suppressor cells (CD4+ T cells) suppress the \\nunwanted production of antibody by B cells. The pathogenic mechanism of HIV may be \\nsummarized as under: \\n1. Diminished positive signal to B cells resulting in poor production of specific \\nantibodies. This ultimately results in dIfferent types of bacterial infections in AIDS cases. \\n2. Diminished signal to cytotoxic or suppressor T cells resulting in defective killing \\nof intracellular virus. This ultimately results in failure to eliminate HIV and other \\nassociated viral infections. \\n3. Diminished signal to NK cells causing impaired defence against tumours. This \\nultimately results in increased prevalence of tumours ego Kaposi\\'s sarcoma. \\n4. Diminished signal to macrophages resulting in impaired killing of organisms \\nwithin macrophages. This ultimately results in infections by organism like Toxoplasma \\ngondii. \\n5. Diminished response to skin reactivity because of the non-availability of helper \\nT cells at the site of injection of antigens resulting in little release of mediators and poor \\nresponse to skin test antigens. \\n6. HIV can also infect: \\n(i) Monocytes \\n(ii) Macrophages leading to opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis and \\ntoxoplasmosis. \\n(iii) Microglia, neurons, capillary endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes \\nin the brain leading to the diverse CNS manifestations of AIDS. \\n(iv) M (membranous) cells and enterochromaffin cells in intestinal mucosa leading \\nto chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption. \\nSince most of the above cells lack CD4 antigen, HIV may be able to utilize alternative \\nreceptor. \\nKaposi\\'s sarcoma was one of the earliest diseases used to define AIDS. This rare \\ntumour had been known for many years; it usually occurred at a single site and was \\nnot aggressive. In AIDS patients the tumour arises in many sites, including the skin, mouth, \\ngut and eye. The tumours arise from endothelial cells of blood vessels, causing bluish\\xad\\npurple, raised irregular lesions. The aetiological agent is thought to be human herpesvirus \\n8.

This opportunist pathogen was known to cause infections in theTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 205 \\nimmunocompromised, but the diagnosis in young men with no explanation for their \\nimmunosuppression was the first clue to the recognition of AIDS. \\nToxoplasma gondii infections can manifest at various sites, but are always associated \\nwith compromised patients. The brain is an important site. \\nHIV dementia develops in 25% of patients with AIDS and is marked by a gradual \\nloss of cognition, progressing to overt dementia. Brain scans show a loss of tissue, with \\nwidening of sulci and ventricles. \\nIn developing countries many of the same infections are seen but there is an \\nemphasis on local problems. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections are an enormous problem \\nin many regions, with the development of strains of the organism resistant to many \\nantibiotics. Many patients show profound weight loss, perhaps accompanied by chronic \\ndiarrhoea; the term slim disease has been given to this presentation. \\nPaediatric AIDS cases suffer from many of the problems of adults. However, children \\ninfected early in life or at birth are at risk of recurring bacterial infections as they have \\nnever acquired immunity to the organisms. Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary \\nlymphoid hyperplasia are presentation seen only in young children. \\nPathogenesis of HIV Infection and Aids \\nAIDS is unique sexually transmitted disease without local genital manifestations \\nat any time during infection but with grave systematic manifestation. The first cell to \\nbecome infected may be resident tissue macrophages or sub mucosal lymphocytes\\' in the \\ngenital tract or rectum. The virus is than transported to draining lymph node where it \\nreplicates extensively 2-3 weeks after infection most patients develops viraemia, fall in \\nCD4+ T lymphocytes and glandular fever like illness. The incubation period in the acute \\nstage is from 1 to 2 months. This is preceded by a period of intense, unrestrained viral \\nreplication, reflected in the presence of high numbers of viral RNA genomes and p24 \\nantigen in the circulation. After entering the body, virus is taken up by cells such as \\ndendritic cells that carry the viral receptors. Within 24-48 h infected cells are present in \\nthe regional lymph nodes; virus can be detected in the blood and circulating lymphocytes \\nby 5 days. As the immune system responds, both p 24 antigen and RNA copy number \\ndecrease, so that by 6-12 months p24 antigen is usually undetectable and the RNA load \\nhas stabilized at a lower level; in some it may be undetectable. The decline in RNA copy \\nnumber is usually by at least 3-4 10glO\\' and the effectiveness of the immune system in \\ncontrolling virus replication at this time forecasts when the virus will escape control and \\nsymptoms appear. Temporary increases in the RNA level can be seen dUling intercurrent \\ninfections, immunizations and pregnancy. \\nPatients with AIDS are profoundly immunosuppressed. It was recognized early that \\nthe ratio of T helper to cytotoxic T cells (CD4:CD8) was markedly reduced. In fact, the \\nratio is upset in the acute stages, but is restored as the patient\\'s response controls the \\nvirus. \\nIn peripheral blood, lymphoid tissue and other tissues such as brain where HIV \\nreplication occurs, HIV targets, CD4 positive (CD4+) cells and cells of the206 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nmonocytemacrophage lineage; the latter may act as an important reservoir of virus. \\nMacrophages are also important in carrying the virus into the central nervous system \\nacross the blood-brain barrier. \\nThe proportion of infected CD4+ cells and the level of circulating virus rise as the \\ninfection progresses, reflecting increasing virus replication until the patient becomes \\nsymptomatic. Activation of latently infected lymphocytes can be achieved by contact with \\nforeign antigen and lectins such as phytohaemagglutinin. Activation of uninfected CD4+ \\ncells is also important in increasing their sensitivity to infection. \\nDestruction of CD4+ cells is caused by: \\n• viral replication \\n• syncytium formation via membrane gp 120 binding to cell CD4 antigen \\n• cytotoxic T cell lysis of infected cells \\n• cytotoxic T cell lysis of CD4+ cells carrying gp 120 released from infected cells. \\n• natural killer cells \\n• antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity \\nSero\\xad\\nconversion \\nMonths \\np24 antigenaemia \\nAsymptomatic AIDS \\nor PGL \\nTime \\n345678 \\nYears \\nFig. 10 : Events in HIV infection \\nAnalysis of the viral genomes from a patient shows that there are several different \\nviral genomes present at any time and that these change with time. virus isolated in culture \\nmay be different from the predominant variants in the blood. Viruses isolated in the later \\nstages of infection have been shown to grow more rapidly, to higher titres and to form \\nsyncytia (giant cells) more readily than virus isolated in the early stages.

This results in a major difference from the picture \\nseen in older children and adults in that the initial replicative phases is not limited by \\nthe immune response and high levels of viral RNA persist. The RNA counts are often \\nmore than 100 OOO/mi at 2 months. About three-quarters will show a steady decline \\nthereafter of 0.610g10 each year; however, by age 9-16 years, a third are still asymptomatic \\nand show little impairment of immune function.

It has been suggested that this group of rapid \\nprogresses can be identified by detection of virus by RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) \\nand culture within 48 h of birth. Analysis of the child\\'s RNA can show that it differs \\nfrom that of the mother, suggesting that replication has occurred by the time of sample \\ncollection or that a minor maternal variant has been transmitted to the baby. \\nLABORATORY DIAGNOSIS \\nLaboratory tests for the diagnosis of HIV infection \\n1.

Thus, to date the main approach \\nto the diagnosis of infection in patients and for screening populations. e.g blood donors, \\nhas been by testing for anti-HIV. However, when serological tests are inappropriate, such \\nas during the early acute stage and in infants who still carry maternal anti-HIV, direct \\ndetection methods are required. By 1988, pattern changed and more specific tests were \\ndeveloped based on recombinant antigens (second generation) and synthetic peptides as \\nantigen (third generation). The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA is 99.7% and 95% or \\nmore respectively. If one ELISA and western blot is used then accuracy is 99.99%. \\nTests for anti-HIV \\nThis was the first practical approach and many different assays are now available, \\nmost using enzyme tracing of the reaction (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ELISA). \\nAll current tests use HIV antigens derived from cloned recombinant HIV gag, pol and \\nenv genes expressed in Escherichia coli, or synthetic peptides. Western or immunoblotting \\nhas been used extensively as a confirmatory assay. Most current assay can detect antibody \\nto both HIV-l and HIV-2 antigens. A first positive result must be confirmed by at least \\ntwo other different assays with different viral antigens, and a second serum sample \\nchecked to confirm that the original sample was correctly identified. \\nAs all who are infected with HIV remain so, a positive tests for anti-HIV indicates \\nthat the patient is infected. Most patients will seroconvert within 2-3 months but some \\nmay take longer. Thus there is a window before antibody tests can detect infection. \\npeR \\nBoth HIV RNA and DNA sequences can be detected by PCR. RNA sequences are \\nfound in extracellular virus particles in plasma. Levels of RNA can be assayed as copy \\nnumber and indicate the extent of virus replication in the patient. Measurement of plasma \\nvirus load is now essential for monitoring disease progression and response to antiviral \\ntherapy. A number of commercial assays have been developed. e.g the Roche monitor™ \\nand Bayer Nuclisens™ assays, to provide accurate and standardized viral load \\nmeasurements in clinical laboratories. \\nHIV proviral DNA is synthesized in infected cells, and can be detected readily in \\nperipheral blood mononuclear cells of infected individuals. This method is principally \\nused to diagnose infection in infants born to HIV-infected mothers. As infection is often \\nacquired perinatally, a negative test result at 3 months or later is required to exclude \\ninfection. In horizontally transmitted infections, detection of proviral DNA can be usedTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 209 \\nto diagnose an acute infection before seroconversion, although detection of plasma viral \\nRNA is more often used. \\nTests for p24 antigen \\nP24 antigen is part of the virion core and it can be found in the blood when there \\nis active viral replication. Antigenaemia is usually of short duration at the time of initial \\ninfection, and may not be detected in all cases. As the antibody response builds up antigen \\ntests become negative. However, late in infection, p24 antigen may reappear until most \\npatients give a positive result. Tests for p24 antigen are now used less often since the \\nintroduction of PCR assays for viral RNA load estimation for monitoring disease \\nprogression. Similarly, p24 antigen detection is rarely used for the diagnosis of acute \\ninfection before seroconversion for antibody, or detecting infection in neonates. \\nImmunofluorescence test \\nIn this test HIV infected cells are acetone fixed on to glass slides and then reacted \\nwith test serum followed by fluorescein conjugated anti human gammaglobulin. A positive \\nreaction appears as apple green fluorescence of cell membrane under fluorescence \\nmicroscope. \\nVirus isolation \\nIsolation of HIV is slow, taking from 3 to 6 weeks. The usual sample is blood, from \\nwhich the lymphocytes are separated and co-cultured with phytohaemagglutinin-stimualted \\ndonor lymphocytes. Virus presence is detected by assays for reverse transcriptase and p24 \\nantigen in the culture fluids. With the advent of PCR, there are now few, if any, diagnostic \\nuses of virus isolation. \\nHTLV-l \\nAssays for the detection of antibody to HTLV-I are available; as with HIV, \\nconfirmation by other assays or immunoblot must be attempted, although interpretation \\ncan be difficult. Confirmatory tests are able to distinguish between HTLV-I and HTLV\\xad\\nII. Detection of HTL V proviral sequences by PCR can also be used as a confirmatory test, \\nand to distinguish HTLV-I and HTLV-II. \\nTreatment \\nHTL V -1 Infection \\nInterferon and inhibitors of reverse transcriptase may have a role, but further \\nevaluation is needed. \\nHIV infection and AIDS \\nSpecific therapy for HIV infection has been available for some years since the \\ninhibitory effect of zidovudine on the viral reverse transcriptase (reverse transcriptase \\ninhibitor, RTI) was discovered. It was established that zidovudine therapy could lead to210 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nan improvement in the patient\\'s health, with weight gain, a reduction in viral load and \\npartial recovery of CD4+ cell numbers. However, the improvement seldom lasted longer \\nthan 6 months, as drug-resistant mutants were selected. A similar response is seen with \\nother RTIs used along. More recently, a second point of attack against HIV has been \\nexploited with the development of drugs active against the viral protease. \\nThe major advance has come with the application of combination therapy, where \\nRTIs are given with protease inhibitor. At present, the compounds available are: \\n• nucleoside analogue RTIs: zidovudine; didanosine (ddI); abacavir; zalcitabine \\n(ddC); stavudine; lamivudine \\n• non-nucleoside RTIs: nevirapine; delavirdine; efavirenz \\n• protease inhibitors; indinavir; ritonavir; nelfinavir; saquinavir; amprenavir. \\nInitial therapy is now a combination of two RTIs and a protease inhibitor. A typical \\ncombination is: \\n• zidovudine 200 mg three times a day \\n• lamivudine 150 mg twice a day \\n• indinavir 800 mg three times a day or nelfainavir 750 mg three times a day. \\nIt is essential that the drugs are started together and that the regime is adhered \\nto strictly. It is important to know if the drugs have been used before by that patient and \\nif the patient is infected with drug-resistant virus. Each drug should be given at its \\noptimum dosage and schedule. If a drug is to be replaced because of prior use, known \\nresistance or development of resistance, an alternative should be chosen that does not \\nshow cross-resistance with the drug being replaced. \\nIt is important to continue with the prophylaxis and prompt treatment of opportunistic \\ninfections such as Pneumocystis carinii and Toxoplasma gondii. Some patients have problems \\nwith compliance to the drug regime and some suffer significant side-effects. About 50% \\nof those on long-term therapy will suffer a redistributon of body fat the lipodystrophy \\nsyndrome. Many patients have been treated for years with a good quality of life as a result \\nof these advances. The major problems is the emergence of resistance. \\nTransmission and Epidemiology \\nHTLV-l and HTLV-II \\nThe three lineages of HTLV-I strains are linked to Melanesia, to central Africa and \\nto various countries, the cosmopolitan group. The latter includes viruses from Japan, North \\nand West Africa and the Caribbean, which can be distinguished. HTLV-I and the simian \\nvirus, STLV-I are closely related and it is proposed that human infection occurred many \\nthousands of years ago in Africa and that the presence of the virus in many different \\nparts of the world is related to the migration of ancient peoples. The slave trade may \\naccount for foci found in the West Indies and the southern USA. \\nWhere it is found the virus is endemic in certain communities. In parts of Japan, \\nthe prevalence of antibody can be 27%, with a rising trend from 7 to 8% in the 20-39 \\nyears age group to 52% in females and 32% in males by 80 years. In the Caribbean, theTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 211 \\nrates are in the range of 5-10% with clusters in communities and families. In other regions, \\ninfection has been found in parenteral drug misusers and prostitutes. \\nThe virus is cell-associated in the host, so transmission will occur when infected \\ncells are transferred. This can occur during intercourse. Breast milk is also a source. \\nTransfer of infected lymphocytes during blood transfusion and sharing injecting equipment \\nby drug misusers are other recognized routes. \\nHTLV-II is transmitted by the same routes. The strains found in drug misusers in \\ndifferent countries are related. \\nTransmission of HIV-l and HIV-2 \\nThe World Health Organization estimates that worldwide more than 40 million \\npeople have been infected with HIV and that 16 million have died. \\nVirus is present in the blood, semen, and cervical and vaginal secretions, and these \\nsources are important in transmission. Virus may also be present in cerebrospinal fluid \\n(CSF), saliva, tears and urine, but at lower titres than in blood. There is no epidemiological \\nevidence that these are significant sources for transmission. Free virus is present at high \\ntitre during the early stage of infection and increases in titre in the blood in the later \\nstages of the disease; there is evidence of a greater risk of transmission from such \\npatients. \\nTo transmit, virus has to reach susceptible cells at the point of entry, e.g. Langerhan\\'s \\ncells in mucous membranes, or after entering the circulation. \\nt \\nThe three important routes of transmission of HIV are: \\n- by unprotected, penetrative sexual intercourse \\n- from mother to child \\n- by blood and blood products. \\nSexual Intercourse \\nHeterosexual transfer of virus is the route by which the great majority of infections \\nare spread, accounting for 90% of the global total: most live in the developing world. \\nBoth sexes are affected equally. Overall the estimated risk of transmission from one \\nunprotected exposure is 0.1-0.2% for vaginal intercourse. The probability of transfer is \\nincreased if either partner has ulcerative genital or other sexually transmitted disease. \\nAny trauma during intercourse will also facilitate transfer, by allowing direct access \\nof the virus to susceptible cells and the circulation. Sex workers are at high risk due \\nto their large number of partners; they are often an important reservoir. Transmission \\nmay be more likely from male to female. \\nAIDS was first recognized in homosexual men in the USA. Most early studies \\nestablished that unprotected anal intercourse was a particular risk, especially to the \\npassive, receptive partner. The estimated risk from a single exposure is 0.1-0.3%. \\nTransmission during oral sexual contact has been documented, but is not a major \\nroute.212 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMother to Child \\nMost perinatal transmission occurs late in pregnancy or during birth. The most likely \\nsource is cells and virus in the cervis and vagina, as the baby passes through the birth \\ncanal. The risk of transmission varies from 13 to 32% in the developed world to 25-48 % \\nin the developing world. Prolonged and difficult labour is a factor. Breast milk is another \\npossible source. It is difficult to be precise about the contribution of this route, but estimates \\nranging from 14-30% have been made. \\nBlood and Blood Products \\nAll blood for transfusion and the preparation of products such as factor VIII for \\nhaemophiliacs is screened for anti-HIV by sensitive assays. This eliminates almost all the \\nrisk, but as there is a delay of some weeks before the tests become positive, it is important \\nto screen donors for possible exposure to risk. Preparation of blood products from large \\npools of donations was a major factor in contaminating the product as even one infected \\ndonation could introduce virus to all the material. Transplanted organs have been \\nimplicated in a few cases. \\nIntravenous drug misuse is a risk factor in about one-quarter of AIDS cases in the \\nUSA and to a varying extent elsewhere in the world. The risk rises with the volume of \\nblood injected and the frequency of sharing contaminated equipment. The withdrawal of \\nblood before injection increases contamination. The virus can spread very rapidly so that \\nmost p1isusers in an area become infected in a few months. Those infected in this way \\ncan spread the virus to their sexual partners. Drug and sexual routes merge when misusers \\nsupport their habit by prostitution. \\nOccupational exposure of health care workers to infected patients has resulted in \\ntransmission in a relatively small number of cases. The route is via accidental penetrating \\ninjuries with needles and sharps contaminated with blood. The risk from a needle stick \\nis 1 in 200-300; up to 1998, less than 200 instances had been established or suspected \\nin North America and Europe. Contamination of eyes and mucous membranes is another \\npossible route, but this is seldom confirmed. Transmission from health care workers to \\npatient has been suspected in only a few cases. \\nHIV-2 is transmitted by the same routes as HIV-1 . . \\nThe majority of infected individuals have a recognized exposure to a known source \\nof infection. In some this may be difficult to establish. However, there is no evidence that \\nHIV can spread by casual contact and by inhalation. \\nStudies of people exposed to the virus on many occasions have shown that a few \\nshow no evidence of infection, and remain negative for anti-HIV. The resistance of these \\nindividuals is of great interest to understanding protective immunity. \\nEpidemiology of HIV \\nThe extent of spread of infection can be measured by the numbers of cases identified \\nclinically and by serological testing. Much more evidence can be obtained from \\nseroprevalence surveys of particular groups or the general population. The availabilityTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 213 \\nand collection of samples impose limits. Surveys have been performed on patients \\nattending hospitals antenatal clinics, sexually transmitted disease clinics and blood \\ndonors. Specific groups such as drug misusers and prostitutes can be targeted, non\\xad\\ninvasive sampling, e.g. collecting saliva, may make these studies more feasible. Repeat \\ntesting over time will give an indication of the trend of infection in that population. Such \\nstudies are important in monitoring the effect of intervention strategies and forecasting \\nthe demand for health services. \\nHIV was isolated in the early 1980s but the first identified cases date to the 1960s. \\nDuring the 1970s, the virus began to spread widely in some populations and groups by \\nthe routes described above. \\nIn North and South America, Europe and Australia, at least-30-40% of cases are \\nin gay men. Parenteral drug misusers are the other major risk group in these areas. Virus \\nof sub type B is closely associated with these groups and accounts for at least 50% of \\nall infections. The other cases are in the heterosexual partners of bisexual men, drug \\nmisusers and men and women from other areas of the world. Infected blood caused some \\ncases before screening was introduced. The estimated prevalence in the population is from \\n0.05 to 0.35%. with less than 0.01 % in antenatal patitmts. The numbers of infections in \\nrisk groups can change as health education programmes are introduced; however, their \\nsuccess can vary and advice may be ignored if the perception of risk changes. There have \\nbeen 1.4 million deaths so far in these areas. \\nRegions of Africa have suffered the greatest epidemic spread of the virus, particularly \\nin most of the countries of the sub-saharan region. It is estimated that 60% of the world \\ntotal of infections are in this area. Population prevalences range from 1.5 to 18%, with \\n2-40% of atenatal patients infected. The viruses circulating here are of sub types C, A,D \\nand E. Of these, C has spread rapidly and now accounts for 50% of an infections. There \\nis some evidence that subtype C may be able to transmit more easily by heterosexual \\ncontact that subtype B, due to its greater affinity for the receptors of Langerhan\\'s cells. \\nAlmost 90% of AIDS deaths have occurred in Africa (13.7 million). The virus \\ncontinues to spread, and there were an estimated 3.8 million new infections in 1999. The \\nsocial and economic consequences of this epidemic are devastating, with the loss of \\nparents and wage earners. The high infant mortality will have profound effects in the \\nfuture. \\nHIV was introduced into South and South-east Asia later than in the rest of the \\nworld, and so far there have been 1.2 million deaths from AIDS. Infection is spreading \\nrapidly, with an estimated 1.3 million new infections in 1999. The earliest infections were \\nin drug misusers, but this did not lead to wide spread outside the risk group. The situation \\nchanged with the introduction of sub type C virus, and there is now rapid heterosexual \\ntransmission of this strain. Prevalences from 0.45 to 3.5% have been effective, with 1-10% \\nin antenatal patients, without effective intervention large numbers of cases and deaths \\nwill occur, with all the expected human and socio-economic consequences. Throughout \\nthe region, sub types A, B, C, D and E have been found. \\nAs a result of the wide circulation of different sub types in some populations, \\nrecombinant viruses have been identified. AC and AD recombinants have been found.214 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nStudies in Tanzania suggest that 15% of the virus population in the country is recombinant \\nand that these viruses can be transmitted. A few recombinants have been isolated from \\nareas in the East. \\nThe existence of different sub types of HIV, and recombinants, is important for two \\nreasons. Firstly, assays for anti-HIV and viral nucleic acid must be able to recognize all \\ntypes. Secondly, vaccine developers must take account of the various types and establish \\nthe spectrum of protection of candidate vaccines. \\nCONTROL \\nSexual Transmission \\nUntil a vaccine is available, the emphasis in controlling the spread of infection must \\nbe on risk reduction by avoiding unprotected penetrative intercourse with partners of \\nunknown status. Despite knowledge of the major routes of infection, there has only been \\nlimited success in reducing sexual transmission. Globally the problem is enormous and \\nefforts are hampered by the poverty and lack of resources of the countries worst affected. \\nThe use of condoms and vaginal antiseptics could have an impact, but they need to be \\navailable and acceptable to the local population. \\nIn the areas of the world with low levels of infection early efforts to encourage safe \\npractices had an effect on the spread of the virus among gay men in the Americas and \\nEurope, but this was not always maintained as the perception of the risks changed as \\na result of declining rates of infection and, more recently, as the latest therapies appeared \\nto be succeeding and prolonging survival. Also, it is difficult to persuade the heterosexual \\nmajority that safe practices are relevant to them. \\nMother to Child Transmission \\nThis can be reduced by identifying infected mothers & giving specific therapy in \\nthe later stages of pregnancy and to the baby after birth. It has been shown that zidovudine \\nalone can reduce the transmission rate by a factor of three if given: \\n• Orally to the mother from weeks 14 to 34 of the pregnancy. \\n• Intravenously to the mother during labour pain. \\n• Orally to the child for 6 weeks after delivery. \\nIf the mother is already being treated, zidovudine should be part of her treatment, \\neven if she has had it before, transplacental transfer of the drug is important, perhaps \\naided by phosphorylation of the drug in the placenta. Most transmissions are believed \\nto occur close to, or during, delivery. Thus simpler treatment regimes may be effective. \\nOral therapy for the mother for 1 month during delivery and for a short period post-partum \\nmay halve the rate. Further studies are needed to establish the most appropriate regimes \\nfor the developing world. \\nAs exposure to infected genital secretions is the source of the virus, avoiding \\nprolonged rupture of the membranes before delivery can reduce risk. Caesarean section \\nmay have a similar effect, but is of limited applicability.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 215 \\nBreast-feeding is another possible route. However, studies of children protected by \\nspecific therapy at and after birth do not show that there is a significant extra risk of \\ninfection by this route. Even without therapy, the advantages of breast-feeding if no other \\nadequate nutrition is available far outweigh any risk of infection where alternative \\nnutrition is available, the baby may not be breast-fed. \\nExposure to Blood \\nDrug injectors can avoid risk by not injecting, or can reduce risk by using only clean \\nequipment. Screening of all blood donors should eliminate almost all possibility of \\ntransmission. Factor VIII and other blood products are heat-treated, if possible, to inactivate \\nHIV. All organ donors must be screened. \\nOccupational risk in the health care setting can be controlled by the implementation \\nof safe working practices to prevent accidental injury and contamination with blood and \\nbody fluids. The use of gloves, masks and eye protection is important in situations such \\nas surgical procedures where bleeding and spattering are possible. The risk must be \\nassessed in other situations.

Clinical features/Symptoms \\nDisease \\n- Small pox \\n- Vaccinia \\n- Buffalo pox \\n- Monkey pox \\n- Cow pox \\n- Milker's node \\n- Orf \\n- Molluscum contagiosum \\n- Yabapox \\n- Tanapox \\nThe small pox virus had no animal reservoir and spread from person to person \\nby the respiratory route. After infecting mucosal cells in upper respiratory tract without \\nproducing symptoms it spread to the regional lymph node and after a transient viraemia, \\ninfected cells throughout the body. Multiplic,!tion of virus in these cells led to a second \\nand more intense viraemia which heralded the onset of clinical illness. During first few \\ndays of fever the virus multipled in skin epithelial cells, leading to the development of \\nfocal lesions and characteristic rash. Macules progressed to papules, vesicles and pustules \\nleaving permanent pockmarks particularly on the face. Two kinds of small pox were \\ncommon in the first half of the 20th century. These were called:218 \\n(A) Variola major/classical small pox \\n(B) Variola minor/Alastrim \\nTEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nVariola major had case fatality rates varying from 10-50% in the unvaccinated \\nvariola minor caused a much milder disease and had case fatility rates of less than 1 %. \\nThe viruses are very similar but can be distinguished in the laboratory by restriction \\nenzyme fragment length polymorphisms of their genome. The last natural case of variola \\nmajor detected was Saiban Bibi, a Bangladeshi woman found with small pox on karimganj \\nrailway platform in Assam on 24th May 1975. The last case of variola minor occurred \\nin Merca, Somalia in October 1977. The incubation period is around 12 days. \\n3. Morphology \\nPoxviruses are the largest animal viruses. They are large enough to be seen by light \\nmicroscopy after special staining procedures. In most genera, the virions are brick-shaped \\nwith rounded corners, measuring 250 x 200 x 200 nm in size. They are known as complex \\nviruses. Pox viruses have a biconcave dumb-bell-shaped DNA core and two lateral bodies \\nenclosed in a protein shell about 12 nm thick. It is known as outer membrane, surface \\nof which consists of irregularly arranged tubules. Virions released from the cells are \\nenclosed within an envelope which consists of host cell lipids and several virus-specified \\npolypeptides, including the haemagglutinin. Their DNA genome range in mass from 85 \\nM Da (parapoxvirus) to 185 M Da (avipoxviruses). The vaccinia virus genome has 186.000 \\nbase pairs (123 MDa). The pox virus genome is distinct in that covalent links join the \\ntwo DNA strands at both ends of the molecule, the genome thus being a single \\nuninterrupted molecule that is folded to form a linear duplex structure. The characteristic \\nfeatures is, identical sequences being present at each end of the genome. \\n4. Physical and Chemical Properties \\nPox virus are stable and if protected from sunlight may remain viable for months \\nat room temperature. In the cold or when freeze dried, they survive for years. They are \\nsusceptible to UV light and other irradiations. They are resistant to 50% glycerol and 1 % \\nphenol but readily inactivated by formation or oxidizing disinfectants. The virion contains \\na multiplicity of enzymes and entire multiplication of virus takes place in the cytoplasm \\nof infected cell. All pox virus share a common nucleoprotein antigen. \\n5. CONTROL OF SMALL POX \\nBefore Vaccination \\nBefore the introduction of vaccination, the control of small pox relied on two \\napproaches, variolation and isolation. Variolators aimed to induce immunity equivalent \\nto that after natural infection. Susceptible individuals were deliberately infected with \\nsmallpox pus or scabs by scratching the skin or by nasal insufflation. Although the virus \\nwas not attenuated, infections had lower case fatality rates and were less likely to cause \\npermanent pock marks than those acquired naturally. Variolation was first recorded in \\nChina nearly 1000 years ago, and was practiced in many parts of the world. VariolatorsTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 219 \\nwere active until very recent times. In Afghanistan, Pakistan and Ethiopia their activities \\ncaused problems towards the end of the small-pox eradication programme in the 1970s \\nbecause they spread virus in a way that evaded the measures erected to control natural \\nvirus transmission. \\nVaccination \\nEdward Jenner vaccinated James Phipps with cowpox virus on 14 May 1796 and \\nchallenged him by variolation some months later. He repeated this 'trial', as he called \\nit, in other children, and the description of these events in his 'Inquiry' in 1798 led to \\nthe rapid world wide acceptance of vaccination. Introduction of the vaccine virus into \\nthe epidermis led to the development of a local lesion and the induction of a strong \\nimmunity to infection with small pox virus that lasted for several years. Although the \\nessentials of Jennerian vaccination remained unchanged for the rest of its history, early \\nvaccinators developed their own vaccine viruses, which became known as vaccinia. The \\norigin of these viruses is obscure, and modern vaccinia viruses form a distinct species \\nof orthopoxvirus, related to but very clearly distinct from the viruses of both cowpox and \\nsmallpox. \\nSmall pox was brought under control by: \\n1. routine vaccination of children-compulsory in some countries \\n2. Odtbreak control by isolation and selective vaccination \\nThis was achieved gradually in Europe, the former USSR, North and Central \\nAmerica, and Japan, and the virus had been eradicated from all these areas by the mid-\\n1950s. In 1959 this achievement prompted the world health organization (WHO) to adopt \\nthe global eradication of smallpox as a major goal. At this time 60% of the world's \\npopulation lived in areas where small pox was endemic. A slow reduction in disease \\nwas maintained for the next few years, but epidemics continued to be frequent. \\nConsequently the WHO initiated its intensified small pox eradication programme. This \\nstarted on 1st January 1967 when the disease was reported in 31 countries. It had the \\ngoal of eradication within 10 years. The goal was achieved in 10 years, 9 months and \\n26 days. From a starting point of 10 million to 15 million cases annually and against \\na background of civil strife, famine and floods, success came because of a major \\ninternational collaborative effort-aided by some virus-specific factors. At the beginning \\nof 1976 small pox occurred only in Ethiopia. Transmission was interrupted there in \\nAugust of that year, although an importation of virus into Somalia and adjacent \\ncountries had occurred by then. This was the last outbreak. The last case occurred on \\n26 October 1977. In the final years of the programme its emphasis moved from mass \\nvaccination to a strategy of surveillance and containment. This strategy rapidly interrupted \\ntransmission because: \\n. (i) cases were easy to detect due to the characteristic rash \\n(ii) patients usually transmitted disease to only a few people-and only to those in \\nclose face-to-face contact. \\n(iii) only person with a rash transmitted infection.220 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe WHO Global commission for the eradication of small pox formally certified that \\nsmallpox had been eradicated from the world on 9 December 1979. The use of smallpox \\nas a biological weapon has been raised. It could be a severe threat in unprotected \\npopulations. \\n6. Other poxvirus diseases \\nWith the elimination of smallpox, it has become important to identify and characterise \\nother orthopoxviruses which can infect human beings and causes disease resembling \\nsmallpox (Table) \\nTABLE 11 \\nComparison of properties of some Orthopoxviruses \\nVariola Monkey pox Vaccinia Cow pox Camel \\npox \\nIsolated from Humans Humans, Origin Humans, Camel \\nmonkey, unknown cow \\nanteater \\nPocks on CAM Small, white Small, Pink Large, white Hemorrhagic Small, \\nwhite \\nCeiling temperature on 37.5-38.5 39 41 39.5 38.5 \\nCAM(DC) \\nGrowth on rabbit skin ++ + or ++ + + \\nThymidine kinase sensitivity + \\nPathogenicity for baby mice Low High High High Low \\nAntigens - Vaccinia + + + \\n(specific for) - Variola + + + \\nMonkey pox + \\nMonkey pox: This virus was first isolated in 1958 from an outbreak of pox disease \\nin a captive monkey colony in Copenhagen.

Several cases have been reported from \\nCentral and West Africa. \\nThe cases clinically resembled small pox. However, person-to-person transmission \\nappears to be rare. Serological studies have shown evidence of widespread natural \\ninfection in monkeys in Africa. The virus can be distinguished from variola. \\nBuffalo pox was identified in cattle in India in 1934 and was considered an outbreak \\nof vaccinia in them. Epizootics had occurred in buffaloes and lesions had been observed \\non the hands of persons in contact with infected animals. Two decades after eradication \\nof smallpox and cessation of vaccination, buffalo pox still occurs, proving it to be distinct, \\nfrom variola and vaccinia. Though it resembles them closely, it is possible to distinguish \\nbetween them and in the laboratory. Small pox vaccine does not seem to protect persons \\nagainst occupational buffalo pox.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 221 \\nCow pox and milker's nodes: Both these infections are obtained from cows. Cows \\npox lesions are seen on the udder and teats of cows and may be transmitted to humans \\nduring milking. The lesions in humans usually appear on the hands or fingers and \\nresemble primary vaccinia. The disease is associated with some fever and constitutional \\nsymptoms. Cowpox virus resembles variola and vaccinia antigenically but can be \\ndifferentiated by the hemorrhagic lesions it produces on CAM and rabbit skin. \\nCowpox infection has been observed only in Britain and Europe. There have been \\noutbreaks of fatal cowpox infection in wild animals kept in zoos, including cheetahs and \\nelephants. Natural infection has been observed in domestic cats. It has been suggested \\nthat the primary host of cowpox may not be cows but more likely wild rodents or cats. \\nMilker's node (paravaccinia) is a trivial occupational disease that humans get by \\nmilking infected cows. The lesions are small ulcerating nodules. The virus is unrelated \\nto cowpox and does not grow in eggs. It can be grown in bovine kidney cultures. It \\nresembles the orf virus morphologically. \\nOrf (contagious pustular dermatitis): Orf is a disease of sheep and goats transmitted \\nto human beings by contact. In humans, the disease occurs as a single papulovesicular \\nlesion with a central ulcer, usually on the hand, forearm or face. The virus is unrelated \\nto the variola-vaccinia group and resembles paravaccinia virus morphologically. \\nTanapox: This virus was isolated from epidemics of a febrile illness along the Tana \\nriver in Kenya in 1957. The patients had a single pock-like lesion on the upper part of \\nthe body. The virus is antigenically unrelated to other pox viruses and does not grow \\nin eggs. It can be grows in human and monkey tissue cultures. Monkeys are the only \\nanimals susceptible. The virus is now active in Africa, particularly in Zaire. A similar \\nvirus has been isolated from outbreaks of disese in primate colonies in America. \\nMolluscum contagiosum: This disease, seen usually in children and young adults, \\nis characterized by pink or pearly white wart-like nodules on the skin. Sections of the \\nlesions show large (20-30 Jim) eosinophilic hyaline inclusion bodies which displace the \\nnuclei to the margin. These molluscum bodies are composed of large number of virus \\nparticles, embedded in a protein matrix. Humans are the only susceptible hosts. The virus \\ncannot be grown in eggs, tissue cultures or animals. \\nThe incidence of molluscum contagiosum as a sexually transmitted disease in young \\nadults is increasing. When it occurs in the genital area, it may become inflamed and \\nulcerated and may stimulate HSV infections. \\nHERPESVIRUS \\nIntroduction \\nThe herpesvirus family contains over a hundred sps of enveloped DNA viruses that \\naffect humans and animals. Family Herpesviridae has been divided into three sub families. \\nThe virions of this family have the capacity to establish life long latent infections from \\nwhich virus may be reactivated. They are frequently reactivated in AIDS and following \\nimmunosuppressive therapy for organ transplantation or in cancer.222 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMorphology \\nHerpesviruses are 120-200 nm in diameter. They comprise of four distinct structural \\nelements: envelope, tegument, capsid and core. Envelope is the outermost, it is composed \\nof lipid with numerous small glycoprotein peplomers. Tegument is the electron-dense \\nmaterial present between envelope and capsid. It contains several proteins. Inner to the \\ntegument is icosahedral capsid of 100 nm diameter. It has a total of 162 capsomers. Core, \\ninside the capsid, consists of double-stranded, 124-235 kb DNA. With the exception of \\nEpstein-Barr virus, members of the family Herpesviridae can be cultivated in cell cultures \\nand produce giant cells and intranuclear inclusion bodies in infected cells. The envelope \\ncarries surface spikes, about 8 nm long. Between the envelope and the capsid is an \\namorphous structure called the tegument, containing several proteins. \\n-Envelope \\nTegument \\n.JI'!~~i.. ... ~::a- Capsid \\nFig. 11 Herpesvirus \\nHerpesvirus replicate in the host cell nucleus.

There are two \\ntypes of herpes simplex virus: type 1 virus (HSV-l) and type 2 virus (H~V-2). HSV-l infects \\nprimarily the mouth, the eye and the central nervous system (regions of the body above \\nthe waist), but it is also responsible for a proportion of cases of genital herpes. HSV-2 \\ninfects genital and anal regions. \\nPathogenesis \\nThe infections caused by herpes simplex viruses can be divided into primary \\ninfection, latent infection, reactivation and recrudescence. Herpes simplex is one of the \\nmost common viral infections in humans about 60-90% of adults showing detectable \\nantibody. Primary infection is usually acquired in early childhood (between 2- 5 yrs of \\nage) humans are the only natural hosts and the source of infection are saliva, skin lesion \\nor respiratory secretions. Asymptomatic carriers form the more important source of \\ninfection especially in genital infection with type 2 strains. Transmission occurs by close \\ncontact and may be veneral in genitial herpes. The virus enters through defects in the \\nskin or mucous membranes and multiply locally, with cell to cell spread. The virus enters224 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\ncutaneous nerve fibres and is transported intraxonically to the ganglia where it replicates. \\nHerpes virus diseases are more frequent and severe in the HIV infected and other \\nimmunodeficient subjects. \\nPrimary infections \\nHSV is transmitted only by contact. The portal of entry in primary infection is the \\ndamaged skin or mucosa and the classic lesion is a vesicle beneath the keratinized squamous \\nepithelial cells. The infection of epithelial cells is cytolytic, the cells lose adhesion, \\noccasionally become multinucleate as a result of virus-induced cell fusion and contain \\neosinophilic intranuclear inclusions. The vesicle and surrounding tissue contain a dense \\ninfiltrate of inflammatory cells, mostly mononuclear. The vesicle drains and the lesion crusts \\nbefore healing occurs, sometimes with residual scarring, and draining lymph nodes are \\ncommonly enlarged during this process. Recurrent lesions are morphologically and \\nhistolOgically similar but are usually less extensive, and lymph node swelling is inapparent. \\nHSV-1 Causes: \\n1. Acute gingivostaomatitis \\n2. Herpetic whitlow \\n3. Keratoconjunctivitis \\n4. Eczema herpeticum \\n5. Encephalitis, and \\n6. Generalized infection \\n1. Acute gingivostaomatitis \\nIt is the most common primary lesion. It leads to acute and painful ulcers, coated \\nwith a greyish slough, inside the mouth on the buccal mucosa and on the gums. The \\nlesions may also involve the tonsils, pharynx or nose. Normally, the disease is self-limiting \\nand lesions disappear in 2-3 weeks. \\n2. Herpetic whitlow \\nIt is an occupational hazard of doctors and nurses, who acquire infection by \\nimplantation of virus from saliva and respiratory secretions of patients. The lesion is \\nsimilar to staphylococcal whitlow, although the exudates is serous rather than purulent. \\nVesicles may also be produced on the skin of head and neck. \\n3. Keratoconjunctivitis \\nInfection of the eye of HSV -1 causes an extremely painful ulceration of cornea and \\nvesiculation of the lids with associated conjunctivitis. In majority of the cases, the primary \\nlesions heal in 2-3 weeks. \\n4. Eczema herpeticum \\nIt is a super infection of eczematous skin. It is mainly seen in young children. Crops \\nof vesicles appear mainly on already eczematous areas with extensive ulceration. This \\nresults in protein loss, dehydration and viraemia. The latter may lead to disseminated \\ndisease with fatal consequences.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 225 \\n5. Encephalitis \\nBoth HSV-1 and HSV-2 can also infect central nervous system leading to herpes \\nencephalitis. The main site of infection is temporal lobe where the disease causes necrosis. \\n6. Generalized infection \\nRarely, primary infection with HSV-1 may lead to generalized disseminated infection. \\nPatient develops acute gingivostomatitis, disseminated vesicular skin lesions, hepatitis \\nand involvement of other organs. \\nHSV-2 causes: \\n1. Genital herpes \\n2. Aseptic meningitis, and \\n3. Neonatal infection \\nIt may rarely cause head and neck infections \\n1. Genital herpes \\nHSV-2 causes one of the most prevalent forms of sexually transmitted diseases. It \\nleads to the development of painful vesicles on the genitalia or anal regions with fever, \\nmalaise and tender, swollen lymph nodes. In the females, lesions may occur on the \\nperineum, vagina, cervix or vulva. In the males, the lesions may occur on the glans, prepuce \\nor shaft of the penis. HSV-2 proctitis has been reported in homosexual men. Majority (80%) \\nof cases of genital herpes are due to HSV-2 and remaining cases are due to HSV-1. These \\ncases are possibly due to orogenital sexual practices. HSV-2 may also be involved in oral \\ninfections. It has also been blamed to cause cervical carcinoma. \\n2. Aseptic meningitis \\nIt may occur as a complication of HSV-2 genital infection. \\n3. Neonatal infection \\nIt is acquired by the neonates usually from their mothers during passage through \\nan infected birth canal, but in some cases it may be acquired in the immediate postnatal \\nperiod from parents and nurses. Prenatally, a very few cases may acquire infection by \\nviraemic transmission across the placenta or by ascending infection from the cervix. This \\nmay result in abortions or congenital defects in the child. If a woman has primary genital \\nherpes at the time of delivery, the risk of neonatal herpes is 30-40%. Therefore, caesarean \\nsection is indicated in such mothers. Most of the cases of neonatal herpes are due to HSV-\\n2, but those acquired postnatally may be due to HSV-1. \\nNeonatal herpes may present as: \\ndisseminated disease, with a case fatality rate of 80% most of the survivors being \\nleft with permanent neurologic or ocular sequelae. \\nencephalitis, with high mortality, and \\ndisease localized to mucocutaneous surfaces such as skin,' eye and mouth. \\nLatent infection \\nDuring primary infection, the virus travels from the site of infection in the mouth226 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nto the trigeminal and probably other cranial and cervical ganglia. In genital herpes, HSV-\\n2 travels to sacral ganglia. Within the sensory ganglia, viral DNA exists as a free circular \\nepisome perhaps about 20 copies per infected cells. \\nReactivation and recrudescence \\nReactivation of the virus is provoked by various stimuli such as common cold, fever, \\npneumonia, menstruation, exposure to sunlight stress, etc In infectious virions migrate \\nalong the nerve axon back to the nerve endings, where infection of epithelial cells may \\nresult in cluster of vesicles at the mucocutaneous junctions of the lips, in the nose, or \\neyes or on areas of skin that have experienced a primary infection. Reactivation recurs \\nsporadically, sometimes often, throughout life. \\nControl \\nHSV infection can be successfully treated with acyclovir (acycloguanosine). It acts \\nby interfering with viral DNA synthesis by inhibiting virus DNA-dependent DNA \\npolymerase. For the treatment of ophthalmic herpes simplex infection, it may be used in \\nthe form of ointment. Oral acyclovir 200 mg 5 times daily for 10 days may be used for \\nthe treatment of primary herpes genitalis and orofacial herpes. For the treatment of herpes \\nsimplex encephalitis, neonatal herpes and disseminated infection in immunocompromised \\npatients, intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg, 3 times daily for 2-3 weeks) may be given. \\nVaricella-Zoster Virus (VZV) \\nThe virus was first isolated by weller in human embryonic tissue cultures. VZV \\ncauses varicella (chicken pox) in children and zoster (shingles) in adults and \\nimmunocompromised patients. Varicella follows primary infection in a non-immune \\nindividual while zoster is a reactivation of latent virus when immunity has fallen to \\nineffective levels. A child can catch varicella from an elderly patient with zoster but the \\nlatter occurs only if the elderly or immunocompromised person had suffered from varicella \\nin early part of his life. VZV is similar to the herpes simplex virus in its morphology. \\nThe virus was 1st isolated by Weller in human embryonic tissue culture. \\nVaricella \\nIt is one of the common childhood exanthemata. Portal of entry of the virus is \\nrespiratory tract. Incubation period is about 2 weeks. The source of infection is a chicken \\npox or herpes zoster patient. The portal of entry of virus is the respiratory tract or conjunctiva. \\nAfter an incubation or period of about 2 weeks (7-23 days) the lesion begins to appear. \\nThe earliest manifestation is a maculopopular rash that progresses within a few hours to \\nthe vesicular stage. Vesicles characteristically are surrounded by a red rim. The lesions then \\nrupture and crust or may become secondarily infected and pustular before healing. \\nPocks are centripetal in distribution i.e. they are more profuse on the trunk followed \\nby neck and proximal areas of limbs. Successive crops of vesicles appear over 2-5 days \\nand as a result at anyone time will have lesions at various stages of development on \\nthe same area of the skin. The accompanying fever is usually low grade. The incidenceTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 227 \\nof complications in children is low, the most common problem being secondary infection \\nof lesions and consequent scarring, a problem that can usually be solved by antibiotic \\ntreatment. \\nInfection of adults is generally more severe than in children, the vesicles heal more \\nslowly, secondary bacterial infection and scarring are more common, and the accompanying \\nfever is higher and more prolonged. Some patients of varicella may develop viral \\npneumonitis, encephalitis, Guillain Barre syndrome and Reye's syndrome. Varicella tends \\nto be more serious in pregnancy, if the patient has not been infected during childhood. \\nVZV can cross the placenta following viraemia in the pregnant woman and infect the \\nfoetus. A syndrome of congenital malformations with hypoplasia of limbs, chorioretinitis \\nand scarring of skin associated with maternal varicella in the first trimester may develop. \\nChicken pox in pregnancy can be dangerous for both mother baby. The disease tends \\nto be more serve in pregnant women, with enhanced risks of complications like pneumonia. \\nThe baby may develop two types of complications, depending on the period of gestation \\nwhen the women develops chicken pox. If maternal varicella occurs during the first half \\nof pregnancy, the fetal infection may usually be asymptomatic. Some infants may develop \\nthe fetal varicella syndrome. While varicella is typically a disease of childhood, herpes \\nzoster is one of old age, being common after the age of fifty years. Herpes zoster usually \\noccurs in persons who had chicken pox several years earlier years after the initial infection, \\nwhen the immunity has waned, the virus may be reactivated and triggered by some \\nprecipitating stimulus, travel along the sensory nerve. \\nZoster \\nZoster or shingles is an endogenous reactivation of virus which has remained latent \\nin one or more sensory ganglia following primary varicella many years earlier. Virus \\ntravels down the sensory nerves to produce painful vesicles in the area of skin (dermatome) \\nenervated from the affected ganglion. Thoracic nerves supplying the chest wall are most \\noften affected. When the ophthalmic nerve of trigeminal ganglion is affected the rash is \\ndistributed on the scalp and forehead. In about half of the patients, the eye is affected \\nleading to corneal ulceration, stromal keratitis and anterior uveitis. \\nThe accompanying pain is often very severe for upto a few weeks, and in herpetic \\nneuralgia, which occurs in half of all patients over 60 years of age, may persist for months \\nwhich may require surgical ablation of the ganglion. Zoster of the seventh cranial ganglion \\nmay lead to Bell's palsy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome which is characterized by facial \\nnerve palsy with a rash on the tympanic membrane and the external auditory canal. Zoster \\nmay also cause encephalitis. In immunocompromised and cancer patients, disseminated \\nzoster is sometimes seen. \\nLaboratory diagnosis \\n1. Direct examination of vesicle fluid by electron microscopy may reveal herpes \\nvirus particles. \\n2. Stained smears from the base of the lesion or sections from biopsy tissue show \\nmultinucleated giant cells containing acidophilic intranucelar inclusion bodies.'. 228 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n3. Rapid diagnosis is possible by using monoclonal fluorescent antibody technique. \\n4. VZV antigens can be detected in vesicle fluid by ELISA. \\n5. DNA can be extracted from virions in vesicle fluid, amplified by PCR and \\ndetected by nucleic acid hybridization. \\n6. The virus can be isolated from vesicle fluid in human embryonic lung fibroblasts \\nculture. Cytopathic effect is focal with refractile ballooned cells. It develops \\nslowly over a period of 2 or more weeks. However, VZV antigen can be \\ndemonstrated in nuclear inclusions by immuno-fluorescence with monoclonal \\nantibody before the end of first week. \\n7. Recent infection can be diagnosed by ELISA test for varicella-zoster specific \\nIgM antibody in patient serum. \\nAcyclovir and vidarabine given intravenously are effective in the treatment of severe \\nvaricella and zoster (e.g. in the immunocompromised patients). \\nA live attenuated vaccine from Oka strain of VZV, developed by serial passage in \\ncultured human and guinea-pig fibroblasts is available. It is indicated for active \\nimmunization against varicella in healthy subjects from the age of 12 months onwards. \\nA single vaccine dose protects about 90% of recipients for several years. The vaccine \\ninduces fever and a few skin papules, occasionally in normal children but much more \\nfrequently in immunocompromised children. For instance, a significant minority of \\nchildren with leukaemia, or on steroid therapy may develop mild varicella following \\nvaccination. The vaccine may also establish latent infection in dorsal ganglia and may \\nlead to zoster in the years ahead, but such reactivation is less frequent than that following \\nnatural varicella infection. \\nEpstein-Barr Virus (EBV) \\nThe EBV virus is ubiquitous in all human population. EBV has been named after \\nthe virologists (Epstein and Barr) who first observed it under electron microscope in \\ncultures of lymphoblasts from burkitt's lymphoma. EBV replicates in epithelial cells of \\nnasopharynx and salivary glands, especially the parotid, lysing them and releasing \\ninfectious virions into saliva. B lymphocytes appear to become infected when they infiltrate \\ninfected nasopharyngeal mucosa. Inside B cellG, EBV normally fails to replicate but \\nestablishes life long latency. In these cells, EBV genome persists as multiple full-length \\ncopies in the form of circular episomes. EBV has oncogenic properties and a proportion \\nof infected B lymphocytes undergo transformations and transform cells in vitro too. \\nActivated B lymphocytes secrete immunoglobulins especially IgM. \\nEBV possess envelope glycoprotein gp 350/220, which mediates attachment of the \\nvirus to CD21 receptors present on the susceptible cells. Most shedding of virus takes \\nplace in the oral cavity, therefore, transmission of virus requires salivary contact, either \\nthrough kissing or contaminated eating utensils. This accounts for infection mononucleosis \\nbeing called the kissing disease. The source of infection is tissues the saliva of infected \\nperson who shed the virus in orapharangial secretion for months following primary \\ninfection and intermittently thereafter intimate oral contact as in kissing, appears to beTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 229 \\nthe predominant mode of transmission. Most infections are symptomless, especially when \\nacquired during childhood. However, in adolescents it may cause infectious mononucleosis \\nor glandular fever, infections in immunocompromised hosts and when EBV exerts its \\noncogenic potential, it may cause Burkit's lymphoma, B cell lymphoma and nasopharyngeal \\ncarcinoma. \\nInfectious Mononucleosis (Glandular fever) \\nIt is a primary EBV infection seen mainly in the 15-25 years age group. EBV is \\ncommonly transmitted by infected saliva and initiates infection in the oropharynx. Viral \\nreplication occurs in epithelial cells of the pharynx and salivary glands. Many people \\nshed low levels of virus for weeks to months after infection. Following replication in \\nepithelial cells, the virus infects B lymphoid cells, where it persists in a latent state. In \\nnormal individuals, most virus-infected cells are eliminated but small numbers of infected \\nlymphocytes persist for the life-time of the host. \\nEBV-infected B cells synthesize immunoglobulins. Autoantibodies are typical of the \\ndisease. Heterophile antibody that reacts with antigens on sheep erythrocytes is the classic \\nautoantibody. In addition, many autoantibodies react with cytoskeletal components. EBV \\ninfection causes activation of many B cells that are not infected, and these may be the \\nsource of autoantibodies. \\nAfter an incubation period of 4-7 weeks, patient presents with sore throat due to \\nexudative tonsillitis, generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, malaise, headache, sweating, \\nfatigue and gastrointestinal discomfort. In some cases spleen and liver are often enlarged. \\nA faint transient morbilliform rash may be seen. A maculopopular rash may appear, \\nespecially following treatment with ampicillin due to immune complexes with antibody \\nto ampicillin. The disease usually lasts for 2-3 weeks. However, some patients develop \\ncomplications such as Guillain Barre syndrome. Bell's palsym meningoencephalitis, \\ntransverse myelitis, haemolytic, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, carditis, nephritis, pneumonia \\nand splenic rupture. \\nInfections in Immunocompromised Host \\n• EBV causes X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome in male members of certain \\nfamilies with an X-linked recessive immunodeficiency with a reduced ability \\nto synthesize interferon. About half of the boys die, within a month, from sepsis \\nor haemorrhages and remainder develop and die from B celllymphoproliferation \\nwith associated hypogammaglobulinaemia and later lymphoma. \\n• EBV may cause progressive lymphoproliferative disease in transplant recipients, \\nimmunodeficient children and AIDS patients. \\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) \\nIn vivo, CMV replicates in epithelial cells in salivary glands, kidneys and respiratory \\nepithelium. In vitro, they can be isolated on human fibroblast cells. An individual infected \\nwith CMV carries the virus for life and may shed it intermittently in saliva, urine, semen, \\ncervical secretions and breast milk. The virus is found in 0.3-2.4% of population that have230 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nbeen sampled throughout the world. Infection is transmitted by close contact between \\nindividuals and blood transfusion. It may be acquired at any time, i.e. prenatal, perinatal \\nand postnatal. CMV are the largest viruses in the herpesvirus family being 150-200 nm \\nin size. Cytomegaloviruses have been identified in human beings, monkeys, guinea pigs \\nand some other. CMV spreads slowly and probably requires close contact for transmission. \\nIt may spread through salivary or other secretions or by sexual contact. A special method \\nof transmission is by blood transfusion or organ transplants. They are highly infectious \\nin early infancy. \\nPrenatal (intrauterine) infection \\nCMV is the most common agent to cause intrauterine infection and prenatal damage \\nto foetus leading to congenital abnormalities. Approximately 1 % of all babies become \\ninfected in utero. Maternal viraemia following primary CMV infection or a reactivation \\nduring pregnancy may result in foetal infection. Majority (95%) of these are without \\nobvious symptoms at the time of birth and 5% symptomatic infants have cytomegalic \\ninclusion body disease. This infants show signs of growth retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, \\njaundice, thrombocytopenia, microephaly, encephalitis and chlorioretinitis. Of the remaining \\n95% about 15% develop deafness and mental retardation. \\nPost natal infection \\nThis is acquired from infected maternal genital secretions or from breast feeding. \\nPost natal infection \\nThis may be acquired by kissing (from saliva), sexual intercourse or artificial \\ninsemination (from semen), blood transfusion and organ transplantation. \\nInfections acquired it may cause hepatitis in young children. In adults and older \\nchildren, it may cause a syndrome resembling EBV infectious mononucleosis, but with a \\nnegative Paul-Bunnell test and no pharyngitis or lymphadenopathy. CMV may cause widely \\ndisseminated infection in immunocompromised individuals such as graft recipients and \\nAIDS patients leading to interstitial pneumonia, chorioretinitis, hepatitis, arthritis, chronic \\ngastrointestinal infection, encephalitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and transverse myelitis. \\nTreatment \\nFor the treatment of severe CMV infections such as pneumonia, chorioretinitis and \\ncolitis in AIDS patients or in other immunocompromised patients, ganciclovir is the drug \\nof choice. \\nTo produce zoster lesions on the area of the skin or mucosa supplied by it.

It infects dividing CD4 + T lymphocytes. \\nInfected T cells show ballooning with nuclear and/ or cytoplasmic inclusions. Macrophages \\nare also infected. These comprise an important reservoir of HHV-6. It can be isolated from \\nsaliva, thus suggesting that salivary glands may act as major reservoir and the saliva \\nas main route of transmission. It can be cultured on transformed B lymphocytes, NK cells, \\nglial cells, fibroblasts and epithelial cells. \\nMost HHV-6 infections appear to be symptomless. They may, however, causes: \\n1. Exanthema subitum or Roseola infantum: This is a mild facial rash occurring \\ncommonly between 6 months and 3 years of age with sudden onset of fever. \\n2. Mononucleosis with cervical lymphadenopathy: This may occur in a few adults \\ndeveloping primary infection. \\nLaboratory diagnosis \\nHHV-6 can be isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in early febrile stage \\nof the illness by co-cultivation with cord blood lymphocytes. Virus antigen can be detected \\nin the infected cells by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies. Virus genome \\ncan be amplified by PCR. Both virus antigen and antibodies can be detected, in patient \\nserum by ELISA. \\nHuman Herpesvirus 7 \\nHuman herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) was discovered in 1990. Like HHV-6, it may also \\ncause roseola infantum. It is proposed that a new genus Roseolovirus may be created \\nfor HHV-6 and HHV-7, which belong to the sub family betaherpesviriane. Both HHV-\\n6 and HHV-7 infect T lymphocytes using the same CD4 receptors on these cells. \\nHuman Herpesvirus 8 \\nHuman herpesvirus 8 (HHV -8) was identified in 1994. It has been blamed to cause \\nKaposi\\'s sarcoma, which is a commonest tumour in HIV-infected .individuals. DNA \\namplification by PCR is the method of detection of HHV -8. \\nCercopithecine Herpes Virus 1 \\nCercopithecine Herpes Virus 1 or simian herpes B virus or herpes virus simiae is \\nsimilar to herpes simplex virus. It commonly infects old World (Asiatic) macaque monkeys \\ncausing a mild vesicular eruption on the tongue and buccal mucosa similar to primary \\nherpetic stomatitis in humans. Human infection with herpes B virus may be acquired from \\na bite or from handling infected animals. The typical lesions produced are vesicles on \\nthe buccal mucosa, which ulcerate shedding the virus and infecting contacts. Infection \\nhas also been transmitted in the laboratory from infected monkey kidney cell cultures. \\nAfter 5-20 days of exposure patient develops local inflammation at the site of entry, \\nusually on the skin, accompanied by itching, numbness and vesicular lesions. It may be \\nfollowed by fatal ascending myelitis. Diagnosis can be made by:232 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n• electron microscopy of vesicle fluid. \\n• isolation of the virus from blood, vesicle fluid, conjunctival swab and CSF, and \\n• DNA amplification by PCR. \\nAdeno Virus \\nMembers of family Adenoviridae are nonenveloped, icosahedral viruses containing \\nlinear double-stranded DNA that replicates in the nucleus of the infected cell. The family \\ncomprises of two distinct genera: Mastadenovirus and Aviade1lovirus. They possess \\nmammalian and avian adenoviruses respectively. There are 47 serotypes of human \\nadenoviruses, which have been assigned to 6 (A-F) sub-genera. Adenovirus infections are \\ncommon world wide mostly in children. Adenoviruses cause infection of the respiratory \\ntract and eyes and less often of the intestine and urinary tract. \\nHuman adenovirus are classified into six groups (called subgroups as sub genera) \\nbased on properties such as hemagglutination fibre length, DNA fragment analysis and \\noncogenic potential. \\nSub genus \\nA \\nB \\nC \\nD \\nE \\nF \\nMorphology \\nTABLE 13 \\nClassification of Human Adenoviruses \\nSerotype \\n12, 18, 21 \\n3,7,11,14,16,21,34,35 \\n1,2,5,6 \\n8-10,13,15,17,19,20,22-30,32,33,36-39,42-47 \\n4 \\n40,41 \\nTotal \\nAdenoviruses are icosahedral Vinons \\ncontaining double-stranded DNA.

Fig 12 : Morphology of adenovirusTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 233 \\nCultivation \\nHuman adenoviruses can be grown on monolayers of HeLa, HEp-2, KB and human \\nembryo kidney cells. Cytopathic effects may take 1-4 weeks and consist of cell rounding \\nand aggregation in grape-like clusters. Infected cells swell and become balanced and show \\ncharacteristic basophilic intranuclear inclusions in stained preparation. \\nPathogenesis \\nAdenoviruses may infect via the conjunctiva or the nasal mucosa. Faecal-oral spread, \\nparticularly among children can also occur. They multiply initially in the conjunctiva, \\npharynx or small intestine and spread to preauricular, cervical and mesenteric lymph \\nnodes. Most of the enteric and some of the respiratory infections are sub clinical. In \\nchildren, asymptomatic infection of tonsils and adenoids, leading to respiratory carriage, \\nand Peyer\\'s patches, leading to gut carriage, may persist for weeks or months. \\nMost of the adenovirus infections are caused by adenoviruses serotypes 1-8. \\nSerotypes 40 and 41 may cause infantile gastroenteritis, 8, 19 and 37 lead to eye infections \\nand serotypes 19 and 37 may also cause genital infections. Five serotypes (43-47, subgenus \\nD) have been recovered from the faeces of AIDS patients. However, their role in these \\npatients is not known. Adenovirus infections lead to lasting immunity to reinfection with \\nthe same serotype. \\nClinical syndromes \\nIncubation period is 5-8 days after which it may lead to: \\nAdenovirus cause infections of the respiratory tract, eye bladder and intestine more \\nthan one type of virus may produce the same clinical syndrome and one type of virus \\nmay cause clinically different diseases. The following syndrome have been recognized: \\n1. Respiratory infections \\n• Pharyngitis: Serotypes 1-7 are usually responsible for pharyngitis particularly \\nin young children. \\n• Pneumonia: Pneumonia in infants and young children may be caused by any \\nof the common serotypes particularly serotypes 1,2, 3 and 7. In military recruits, \\npneumonia may be caused by serotypes 4 and 7. In infants and young children \\ntype 7 may lead to more serious and even fatal pneumonia. \\n• Acute respiratory disease: This syndrome is characterized by fever, chills, \\npharyngitis, cervical lymphadenitis, non productive cough and malaise. This \\noccurs usually in outbreaks in military recruits when they assemble in camps. \\nIt is generally caused by adenoviruses serotypes 3,4, 7, 14 and 21. \\n2. Ocular infections \\n• Pharyngoconjunctival fever: This syndrome of febrile pharyngitis and \\nconjunctivitis occurs in outbreaks in children. It is usually caused by adenoviruses \\n3, 4, 7 and 14. This is seen in civilian population. \\n• Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis: It is a severe and highly contagious infection \\ninvolving all age groups. It often occurs in epidemic form ahd is characterized234 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nby follicular conjunctivitis and progresses to involve the cornea. It was first \\nassociated with adenovirus type 8, but other serotypes (e.g, 3,4,7, 19 and 37) \\nhave also been incriminated in this syndrome. \\n3. Genitourinary infections \\n• Cervicitis and urethritis: These venereal infections are caused by serotype 37. \\n• Acute haemorrhagic cystitis: It is mainly seen in infants and young children \\nand is caused by serotypes 11 and 21. \\n4. Enteric infections \\n• Infantile gastroenteritis: Serotypes 40 and 41 may cause infantile gastroenteritis \\nin up to 10% of the cases. \\nSome human adenoviruses produce carcinomas if injected into new born hamsters, \\nmice or rats. Infection of cultured hamster or rat cells, in vitro, also results in transformation. \\nHowever, there is no evidence that this can occur in man too. \\nEpidemilogy: Adenovirus are endemic and types 1-7 spread readily between \\nindividuals presumably by droplets. Faecal oral transmission can also occur and probably \\ndoes in areas with poverty poor hygene and over crowding. Type 40 & 41 which are \\nwidespread are causes of diarrhoea even in highly developed countries, also spread via \\ndroplets. \\nAdeno associated viruses \\nEM of adenovirus preparation have shown small icosahedral viral particles 20-25 \\nnm in diameter. They are unable to replicate independently as they lack enough DNA \\nor they contain insufficient single stranded DNA. They can multiply only in cells \\nsimultaneously infected with adenoviruses and are called adeno associated viruses (AA V) \\nor adenosatellite viruses. They have been classified as the genus dependovirus (referring \\nto their dependence on adenoviruses) under the family parvoviridae. Type 1, 2 and 3 of \\nhuman origin and cause natural infection while type 4 is of simian origin. Their \\npathogenic role is uncertain. \\nControl \\nThere are no anti viral drugs available that are unequivocally effective for the \\ntreatment of adenoviral infections. Ribavirin, ganciclovir, vidarabine and cidofavir have \\nall been shown to have antiviral activity in vitro and there are anecdotal report of their \\ntherapeutic use in immuno compromised patients with variable success. \\nPOLYOMA VIRUS \\nPolyomavirus The name is derived from \\'poly\\' (many) and oma (tumour). The \\nviruses are species specific, recognized members of this group include the mouse \\npolyomavirus, SV40 of monkeys and two viruses of man JC virus and BKV. Both named \\nafter the initials of the people from whom they were first isolated. SV 40 stands for simian \\nvirus 40. Its double stranded DNA has been exploited the most as vectors for gene transfer \\ninto animal cells.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 235 \\nDuring 1950\\' s the widespread use of monkey kidney cells for isolating polioviruses \\nand preparing vaccine brought to light many viruses that caused in apparent infections, \\nnot until the cells were explanted into culture vessels did cytopathic effects become \\nobvious. These agents were termed \\'Simian viruses\\' one of them that induced a vacuolated \\nor foamy appearance in the cytoplasm was termed SV 40. \\nPolyomaviruses: SV 40 \\nSome viruses of the polyomavirus family induce tumors in animals. One of these \\nDNA tumor viruses was first isolated from monkeys, and it was thus called simian virus \\n40 or SV40. Virus SV 40 was one of the first genetic elements to be studied by genetic \\nengineering techniques and has been extensively used as a vector for moving genes into \\neukaryotic cells. \\nThe SV 40 virion is a non enveloped particle 45 nm in diameter with an icosahedral \\nhead containing 72 protein subunits. Unlike RNA viruses, there are no enzymes in the \\nvirion. The genome of SV 40 consists of one molecule of double-stranded DNA of 5243 \\nbp. The DNA is circular and exist in a supercoiled configuration within the virion. The \\ncomplete base sequences of SV 40 has been determined. \\nSV 40 nucleic acid is replicated in the nucleus, while the proteins are synthesized \\nin the cytoplasm. Final assembly of the virion occurs in the nucleus.\" The replication of \\nthese viruses can be divided into two distinct stages, early and late. During the early stage, \\nthe early region of the viral DNA is transcribed. A single RNA molecule, the primary \\ntranscript, is made by cellular RNA polymerase, but it is processed into two mRNAs, a \\nlarge one and a small one. Introns are present in the SV40 genome, so they are excised \\nout of the primary RNA transcript. In the cytoplasm, the mRNAs are capped and translated \\nto yield two proteins. One of these proteins, the T-antigen, binds to the site on the parental \\nDNA that is the origin of replication, this initiates viral genome synthesis. \\nThe genome of SV40 is too small to encode its own DNA polymerases, so host DNA \\npolymerases are used. Replication occurs in a bidirectional fashion from a single origin \\nof replication. The process involves the same events that have already been described for \\nhost cell DNA replication. \\nLate SV40 mRNA molecules are synthesized using the strand complementary to that \\nused for early mRNA synthesis. Transcription begins at a promoter near the origin of \\nreplication. This late RNA is then processed by splicing, capping, and polyadenylation \\nto yield mRNA corresponding to the three coat proteins, VP1, VP2, and VP3. SV 40 coat \\nprotein mRNAs are then transported to the cytoplasm and translated into the viral coat \\nproteins. The latter are then transported back into the nucleus where virion assembly takes \\nplace. Release of new SV40 virions occurs by cell lysis. Within the permissive monkey \\ncells two genes are expressed immediately after infection. These early genes represent two \\ntumour causing antigens, namely small tumour (t) and a large tumour (T) proteins. \\nSome polyomaviruses cause cancer. When a virus of the polyomavirus group infects \\na host cell, one of two modes of replication can occur, depending on the type of host \\ncell. In some types of host cells, known as permissive cells, virus infection results in the \\nusual formation of new virions and the lysis of the host cell. In other types of host cells,236 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nknown as non permissive, efficient multiplication does not occur. Instead, the virus DNA \\nbecomes integrated into host DNA, analogous to a prophage in the process genetically \\naltering the cells. Such cells can show loss of growth inhibition and become tumor cells, \\na process called transformation. As in certain tumorigenic retroviruses, expression of \\nspecific polyomavirus genes leads cells to the transformed state. \\nMost double-stranded DNA animal viruses, such as SV40, replicate in the nucleus. \\nSV40 has a tiny genome and employs the strategy of overlapping genes to boost its genetic\\xad\\ncoding potential. Some of these viruses cause cancer. \\nHEPATITIS VIRUSES \\nThe term \\'viral hepatitis\\' refers to primary infection of the liver by anyone of a \\nheterogenous group of \\'hepatitis viruses\\' which currently consist of types A, B, C, D, E \\nand G. Type F had been proposed for a putative virus believed to cause transfusion \\nassociated hepatitis. \\nHepatitis virus are taxonomically unrelated except type B. Which is a DNA virus \\nall others are RNA virus. The differentiation is based on their serological and molecular \\nmarkers. Hepatitis F proved to be a mutant of type B virus and not a separate entity. \\nTherefore, it has been deleted from the list of hepatitis viruses. Non viral causes of hepatitis \\ninclude Leptospira, Treponema pallidum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Toxoplasma gondii and \\nEntamoeba histolytica. In the United States, hepatitis B, A and C account for about 40%, \\n30% and 20% respectively. In about 2% cases, hepatitis D occurs in concert with hepatitis \\nB. Only a handful of hepatitis E cases are reported every year, none originating in the \\nUnited States. All are in travellers coming back from countries where the virus is endemic. \\nAll types of viral hepatitis produce clinically similar illnesses. These range from \\nasymptomatic and inapparent to fulminant and fatal acute infections common to all types, \\non one hand, and from sub clinical persistent infections to rapidly progressive liver disease \\nwith cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma, common to the blood-borne types (HBV, \\nHCV & HDV), on the other. Without specific virological tests, it is not possible to determine \\nwhich hepatitis virus is responsible for a case of hepatitis. On the basis of epidemiological \\nand clinical criteria, two types of viral hepatitis are known one type occurred sporadically \\nor as epidemics, affecting mainly children and young adults and transmitted by fecal\\xad\\noral route. This is called infective or infectious hepatitis called type A hepatitis. Second \\ntype of viral hepatitis, transmitted mainly by inoculation was originally observed in \\npersons receiving serum inoculation or blood transfusion called as serum jaundice, serum \\nhepatitis transfusion hepatitis called as type B hepatitis. Soon a type C virus was identified \\nas causing many transfusion associated hepatitis cases. A defective virus which depends \\non the helper functions of type B virus was called delta or type D hepatitis viruses another \\ntype of hepatitis transmitted by the facial oral route prevalent only in developing nations \\nis due to E virus. The sixth member of this group hepatitis G virus can also cause hepatitis \\nbut its role is not yet been understood. \\nBoth HA V & HEV are shed in high titres in the faeces of infected individuals. In \\neach case, the virus present in faeces is replicated primarily in the liver & reaches the \\nintestinal tract following secretions from the hepatocytes into biliary canaliculi andTABLE 14 ..., \\n::z: Hepatitis viruses m \\n> \\nFeature Hepatitis A virus Hepatitis B virus Hepatitis C virus Hepatitis D virus Hepatitis E virus Hepatitis G ~ \\nrs:: virus > t\"\" \\nYear of identification 1973 1965 1989 1977 1980 1995 <: \\nFamily Picomaviridae Hepadnaviridae Flaviviridae Unclassified Caliciviridae Flaviviridae .... \\n~ \\nc::: \\nGenus Hepatovlrsu Orthohepadnavirus Hepacivirus Deltavirus Unnamed Hepacivirus C/l \\nm \\nC/l \\nGenome ssRNA dsDNA ssRNA ssRNA ssRNA ssRNA \\nGenome size 7.5 kb 3.2 kb 9.4 kb 1.7 kb 7.6 kb 9.4 kb \\nVirion 27nm, icosahedral 42 nm, spherical 30-60 nm, spherical 36-38 nm, spherical 27-38 nm, icosahedral? \\nEnvelope No Yes (HBsAg) Yes Yes (HBsAg) No ? \\nStability Heat & acid-stable Acid-stable Ether & acid-sensitive Acid-sensitive Heat-stable ? \\nTransmission Faecal-oral Parental, sexual Parental, sexual Parental, sexual Feacal-oral Parental, \\nsexual \\nVertical transmission \\n- Intrauterine No Yes Possible but rare Possible but rare Yes ? \\n- Perinatal No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \\n- Early post natal infection Possible but rare Possible but rare Possible ? ? ? \\nIncubation period 2-6 weeks 6 weeks-6 months 6-8 weeks 6 weeks-6 months 2-8 weeks ? \\nOnset Acute Insidious or acute Insidious Insidious or acute Acute ? \\nAge preference Children, young adults Young adults, babies, Any age but more Any age Young to middle age ? \\ntoddlers common in adults adults \\nAntigens HAV HBsAg, HBcAg, .

The absence of a lipid envelope is an important factor \\nin this process, as it renders both HA V and HEV stable when suspended in bile. In \\ncontrast, the other human hepatitis viruses possess an outer envelope and are likely to \\nbe rapidly inactivated in bile. The newly replicated HA V and HEV particles \\nhave a direct route to the outside environment that is denied to other hepatitis \\nviruses. \\nHepatitis A virus (HA V) \\nIt is a subacute disease of global distribution affecting mainly children and young \\nadults. HAVis a 27 nm non enveloped RNA virus belonging to the picornavirus family. \\nOnly one serotypes of the virus is known. Natural infection with HAVis seen only in \\nhumans. Type A hepatitis occurs sporadically or as outbreaks which may be caused by \\ncontaminated food, water or milk. In India, type A hepatitis is the most common cause \\nof acute hepatitis in children but is much less frequent in adults. \\nHepatitis A virus (HA V) was previously classified as enterovirus type 72. HAVis \\na nonenveloped 27 nm icosahedral virus containing linear, single-stranded RNA, 7.5 kb \\nin length and of positive polarity (Table). It has only one serotype. HAVis one of the \\nmost stable viruses infecting humans. It can withstand heating at 60°C for one hour and \\ntreatment with 20% ether, acid (pH 1.0 for 2 hours) and many disinfectants. Inactivation \\nof viral activity can be achieved by boiling for 1 minute, by contact with formaldehyde \\nand chlorine, or by ultraviolet irradiation. It can be transmitted to chimpanzes and several \\nspecies of marmoset monkeys and can be grown in cell cultures of primate and human \\ncells. HAVis the only one of the human hepatitis viruses that can be cultivated in vitro. \\nPathogene\\'sis \\nHAV is shed early in the stools of infected individuals, 1-2 weeks prior to the onset \\nof symptoms, and persists for the first several days after the transaminase levels peak. \\nThere is very little virus in the serum and hardly any at all in other body fluids which \\nexplains the epidemiology of the disease as faecal-oral enteric infection. Transfusion\\xad\\nassociated hepatitis A is exceedingly rare. It probably multiplies first in the intestinal \\nepithelial cells and then spreads to the liver via the blood. Viral antigens can be seen \\nin the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. \\nHA V occurs throughout the world and is endemic in countries with substandard \\nhygiene and sanitation, so the vast majority of native population have detectable anti\\xad\\nHAV by the age of 10 years. In developed countries, acute hepatitis A tends to be a sporadic \\novert febrile illness. \\nHepatitis A is an acute self-limiting disease with an incubation period of 2-6 weeks. \\nThe onset is abrupt with fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea and lethargy which comprise \\nthe prodromal (preicteric) stage. Hepatomegaly, due to cell necrosis, causes blockage of \\nthe biliary excretions resulting in jaundice. It may also produce pain in the right upper \\nabdominal quadrant. The fulminant form of hepatitis A and liver failure can occur in \\nless than 0.5% cases. Complete recovery occurs in 8-12 weeks. Hepatitis A has no appears \\nadverse effect on the outcome of pregnancy. Transmission during birth by exposure toTHE ANIMAL VIRUSES 239 \\nmaternal faeces or by breast-feeding has been reported. Type A hepatitis occurs sporadically, \\nwhich may be caused by contaminated food, water or milk. \\nThe severity of the disease varies with age. Only 5% of the children under 3 years \\nof age develop jaundice, while more than 50% of adults develop it. Fatality rate is also \\nmore in adults. In contrast to hepatitis B, hepatitis A infection does not produce \\nextrahepatic manifestations, no carrier state and is not associated with cirrhosis or \\nhepatocellular carcinoma. In India, most individuals are infected early in life, up to the \\nage of 15 and the disease is mild. However, over the next several decades, as standards \\nof hygiene including water supply improve, HA V will become a disease of adults in India, \\nas it is in the US. \\nProphylaxis \\n1. Proper collection, treatment and disposal of sewage. \\n2. Bathing and cultivation of shellfish for human consumption should not be \\nallowed near sewerage outlets. \\n3. Passive immunization with normal human immunoglobulin (NJG) gives protection \\nto sero-negative individuals for a period of 4-6 months. It is recommended for the personnel \\ntravelling to highly endemic areas of the tropics and for the control of outbreaks in \\ninstitutions such as homes for the mentally handicapped. Hepatitis A vaccine consisting \\nof formalin inactivated preparation of virions grown in human fibroblasts or monkey \\nkidney cell lines, adsorbed to alum as an adjuvant can be used for active immunization. \\nTwo doses injected one month apart with or without a booster after 6 months elicit a \\ngood immune response in 99% of vaccines lasting for some years. Because of the low \\nyield of virus from cultured cells the vaccine is costly. It may be given to high risk \\nindividuals like long-term visitors to countries in which HAVis endemic, sewage workers, \\nsexually active homosexual men and intravenous drug users. \\nHepatitis B Virus (HBV) \\nType B hepatitis is the most widespread and most important type of viral hepatitis. \\nTotal 1/3 of the world populations is estimated to be infected by HB virus. A quarter \\nof these develop serious liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and primary \\nhepatic cancer. \\nThe family Hepadnaviridae contains 5 hepatotropic viruses specific for man (HBV), \\nwood chuck (WHV), ground squirrel (GSHV), duck (DHBV) and heron (HHBV). All these \\nviruses are highly species specific, for example, the heron HBV does not infect ducks, \\nand the wood chuck virus does not infect ground squirrels. These viruses contain double\\xad\\nstranded DNA genomes and induce persistent infections in their natural hosts. HBV, WHV \\nand GSHV have been associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Only \\nHBV causes human infection, therefore, only this virus will be discussed further. \\nMorphology \\nHBV or Dane particle is a complex 42 nm double shelled particle.

It encloses an inner icosahedral 27 nm nucleocapsid (core). It contains \\nhepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg). Inside the core is the genome of HBV and a DNA\\xad\\ndependent DNA polymerase. The HBV genome consists of a 3.2 kilobase pair molecule \\nof circular dsDNA of most unusual structure. The plus strand is inco\"mplete leaving 15-\\n50% of the molecule single-stranded. The minus strand is complete and contains four \\noverlapping open reading frames (genes) coding for multiple proteins. \\n1. The P gene (or POL), which comprises 80% of the genome and overlaps all the \\nother genes, encodes DNA polymerase with three distinct enzymatic functions (DNA \\npolymerase, reverse transcriptase, and RNase H) \\n2. 5 gene encodes the envelope protein, which occurs in three forms a large protein, \\ntranslated from pre-51, pre-52, plus 5 regions of the genome and occurs in the envelope \\nof infectious virions; a middle-sized protein comprises the product of pre-52 plus 5; and \\nfinally the most abundant product is the 5 protein, the basic constituent of non-infectious \\nHBsAg particles, the product of 5 gene only. \\n3. The C gene has two initiation sites that divide it into a pre-C and a C region, \\nproducing two distinct proteins, HBeAg and HBcAg respectively.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 241 \\n4. Gene X, spanning the cohesive ends of the genome encodes for HBxAg, which \\ncan transactivate the transcription of cellular and viral genes, its clinical relevance is not \\nknown. \\nFrom the core protein is derived hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg). It is associated with \\nthe virion and is also found free in the plasma, especially when there is active viral \\nreplication. \\nAlong with the mature virions, two sub virion morphologically forms are formed \\nin large excess. (1) Spherical particles with a diameter of 22 nm and (2) Elongated tubules \\nof similar diameter. Both these pleomorphic structures are composed of HBsAg, are devoid \\nof HBcAg and nucleic acid. They are not infectious and consists solely of surplus virion \\nenvelope. They normally occur in large (100 to 1,000 fold excess over the mature 42 nm \\nvirions. \\nHBsAg carries a group-specific antigen \\'a\\' and two type -specific antigens, \\'d\\' or \\n\\'y\\' and \\'w\\' or \\'r\\'. Thus there are four antigenic types of HBsAG - adw, adr, ayw and \\nayr. Type ayw is predominant in Africa, Russia and India, particularly in parenteral drug \\nusers. Type adw is predominant in Europe and USA particularly in homosexual men and \\ntype adr is predominant in Asia. The w antigen has additional four variants and \\nadditional antigens such as \\'q\\', \\'x\\' and \\'g\\' have been identified, but they have not been \\ncharacterized. HBV is present in the blood mainly in the form of HBsAg and to smaller \\nextent as Dane particles. \\nHBV has not been cultivated in the laboratory. Experiments on chimpanzee \\ninoculation reveal that the virus gets inactivated by heating at 60°C for 10 minutes and \\nby treatment with hypochlorite (10,000 ppm available chlorine) and 2% glutaraldehyde \\nin 10 minutes. \\nPathogenesis \\nThere are three important modes of transmission of HBV infection: parenteral, \\nperinatal and sexual. \\n1. Parenteral transmission: HBV is present in the blood and in body fluids such \\nas semen, vaginal secretions, menstrual discharge, saliva, colostrums and breast milk. The \\nconcentration of HBV in blood and body fluids is much greater than HIV. Less than 1 \\nIII of blood contaminating a syringe or needle, can readily transmit hepatitis B from one \\nindividual to another. Transmission of infection may result from accidential inoculation \\nof minute amounts of blood or fluid containing HBV during medical, surgical or dental \\nprocedures. Needlestic injuries, use of contaminated needles and syringes, intravenous \\nand percutaneous drug abuse, ear and nose piercing, tattooing, acupuncture, sharing of \\nshaving razor and kissing can transmit HBV infection. HBsAg has been demonstrated \\nin several species of mosquitoes and bed bugs, but transmission of infection by arthropods \\nhas not been authenticated. Professionals occupationally at risk include dentists, surgeons, \\npathologists, mortuary attendants and technicians working in serology, haematology, \\nblood bank biochemistry, microbiology and haemodialysis units. \\nEpidemiology: Hepatitis B occurs throughout the world. There is no seasonal242 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\ndistribution. The infection is usually sporadic, though occasional outbreaks have occurred \\nin hospitals, orphanages and institutions for the mentally handicapped. \\nThe prevalence of hepatitis carriers varies widely in different countries, in relation \\nto their living standards. The overpopulated under developed regions have high endemicity \\n(carrier rate more than 8% as in equatorial Africa, South East Asia, China, parts of South \\nAmerica); low endemicity in the developed countries (carrier rate less than 2% in Western \\nEurope, North America, Australia) and intermediate endemicity in other areas (carrier rate \\n2 to7%, as in Eastern Europe, the middle east south Asia and parts of South America). \\nIndia falls in the intermediate group, with higher carrier rates in the southern part of \\nthe country and lower rates in the northern part. \\nThe rich and the poor countries also differ in the age and modes of infection. In \\nthe former, infection occurs mostly in adolescents and young adults through contaminated \\nsyringes and needles, typically among drug addicts, and through sex, particularly by \\nhomosexual intercourse. In the poor countries, infection occurs usually at younger ages, \\neither perina tally from mother to baby, or horizontally among children. \\nNatural infection occurs only in humans. There is no animal reservoir. The virus \\nis maintained in the large pool of carrier whose blood contains circulating virus for long \\nperiods, in some even lifelong. A carriers is a person with detectable HBsAg in blood \\nfor more than 6 months. Following infection, about 5-10% of adults, 30% of children and \\n90% of neonates become carriers. The carrier state is more common among males. There \\nare over 350 million carriers now worldwide. Of them, about 45 million are in India, which \\nhas the second largest carrier pool, next only to China. \\nTransfusion of carrier blood, once the most widely known mode of infection has \\nlargely been eliminated wherever donor screening is strictly enforced. Therapeutic and \\nprophylactic preparations from pooled human blood and serum have led to hepatitis, but \\nthis risk is now\\'minimal, with screening of donors and production techniques ensuring \\nvirus inactivation. However HBsAg screening is not a totally fail safe method as infection \\nhas occurred even with HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive blood, which may have had \\nundetectable amounts of virus. \\nMany other therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic and even non medical procedures \\nare now the main modes of infection. HBV is very highly infectious, far more than HIV. \\nAny object or procedure than can convey minute traces of infected blood or other material, \\nas little as 0.00001 ml, can be infectious. These include shared syringes, needles and other \\nsharp items or endoscopes, personal articles such as razors, nail clippers and combs, and \\npractices such as acupuncture, tattooing, ritual circumcision, ear or nose piercing, and \\nfield camps for surgery or disease detection by blood testing where separate sterile articles \\nmay not be available. Professionals using sharp articles like barbers, dentists and doctors \\nmay unwittingly transmit the virus if great care is not taken. \\nInfection by direct contact with open skin lesions such as pyoderma, eczema, cuts \\nand scratches is very common among young children in developing countries as also \\nthrough household transmission where opportunities exist for contact with blood or saliva \\namong members.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 243 \\nHBV has been shown to survive in mosquitoes and bed bugs for about 2 weeks \\nafter blood meal, but no virus multiplication occurs. They do not appear to transmit the \\ninfection. \\nCongenital or vertical transmission is quite common from carrier mothers. The risk \\nto babies is high if the mother is HBeAg positive (60-90%) and low if negative (5-15%). \\nTrue congenital infection (in utero, transplacental) is rare. Infection is usually acquired \\nduring birth by contact of maternal blood with the skin and mucosa of the fetus, or in \\nthe immediate postnatal period. infection by ingestion has been reported, but its efficiency \\nis very low. However it is safer if carrier mothers do not breast feed when proper nutrition \\nof their babies can be otherwise ensured. HBV infected neonates generally do not suffer \\nfrom any clinical illness, but remain carriers for life and some of them may develop \\nhepatocellular carcinoma after many decades. \\nSexual transmission of HBV occurs everywhere, but is more important in the \\ndeveloped countries, particularly in the promiscuous homosexual. The risk of transmission \\nby heterosexual and homosexual contact increase with the number of partners and the \\nduration of such relationships. HBV infection has occurred after artificial insemination. \\nSemen donor screening a therefore obligatory. \\nCertain groups and occupations carry a high risk of infection. These include medical \\nand paramedical personnel, staff or blood banks, dialysis units, medical laboratories and \\nmental health institutions, barbers and sex workers. Dentists and doctors have been \\nresponsible for small outbreaks. In non-endemic countries like Britain HEV carriers are \\nbarred from invasive medical plactice. Carriers are also not permitted to be medical \\nstudents. \\nThe only safe and effective measure for prevention is universal active immunization. \\nIts success has been demonstrated in some highly endemic areas like Taiwan where the \\ncarrier rate fell from 18% in 1986 to 8% in 1993 following immunization. In 1992, the \\nWorld Health Assembly recommended the integration of hepatitis B vaccine into the \\nnational immunization programmes of all nations by 1997. More than 80 countries have \\nconformed. India is one of the few countries yet to initiate this measure mainly because \\nof the high cost of imported vaccine. Now that the vaccine is manufactured in India, and \\nis available at lower cost, it should be possible to include this is the national immunization \\nschedule. \\n2. Perinatal transmission: HBV can be transmitted from carrier mothers to their \\nbabies during the perinatal period. Transmission probably occurs when maternal blood \\ncontaminates the mucous membranes of the new born during birth. Infection may also \\nresult from haematogenous transplacental transmission, breast-feeding and close postnatal \\ncontact between infant and the infected parent. Perinatal infection and infection during \\nthe first year of life have important consequences because 90% of these infants become \\nchronic carriers, as compared to 10% of those infected after the age of 6 years. Such \\nchronicity increases the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. \\n3. Sexual transmission: Since HBV is present in semen and vaginal secretions, \\ntherefore, it can be transmitted by sexual contact. Sexually promiscuous individuals244 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nparticularly male homosexuals are at very high risk. Most of the HBV infections are \\nsubclinical, particularly in childhood. \\nThe course of acute HBV infection can be divided into three phases: preicteric, icteric \\nand convalescent. \\n(A) Preicteric (prodromal) phase: After an incubation period of 6 weeks to 6 months \\npatient develops malaise, anorexia, weakness, myalgia, nausea, vomiting and pain in the . \\nright upper abdominal quadrant. A minority of patients develop arthralgia, urticarial or \\nmaculopapular rash, polyarteritis nodosa and glomerulonephritis. These features may be \\nrelated to circulating immune complexes. \\n(B) Icteric phase: Two days to two weeks following the initial symptoms patient \\ndevelops jaundice, pale stools and dark urine (bilirubinuria). Hepatocellular damage is \\ndetectable biochemically before the onset of jaundice and persists after it has resolved. \\n(C) Convalescent phase: This phase is long and drawn out with malaise and fatigue \\nlasting for several weeks. The duration of uncomplicated hepatitis is rarely more than \\n8-10 weeks, but mild symptoms may persist for more than one year. The incubation period \\nis long (1-6 months). About 90-95% of adults with acute hepatitis B infection recover within \\n1-2 months of onset and eliminate the virus from the body within about 6 months \\nremaining immune thereafter. Mortality is 0.5 -2% but may be more in post transfusion \\ncases. \\nHBV infection occurs virtually in every country of the world. The carrier rate in \\nIndia is estimated to be 5%. Mild cases that do not result in jaundice are termed anicteric. \\nLess than 1 % of the iceteric cases die of fulminant hepatitis, 90-95% recover with complete \\nregeneration of the damaged liver within 2-3 months. The remaining patients progress \\nto chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatoma cells often \\ncontain HBV DNA, but the patient is usually negative for HBcAg and other indications \\nof ongoing viral replication. Integration of HBV DNA fragments into the hepatocyte \\ngenome is a frequent event during HBV infection. \\nHepatitis B carriers \\nHBV replicates within hepatocytes viral DNA exist in hepatocyte nucleus in the \\nfree extrachromosomal state or integrated with the cell chromosome. DNA is synthesized \\nfrom an RNA template by reverse transcriptase. \\nAbout 5-10% of HBV infections result in chronic carrier state. The latter may be \\ndefined as persistence of HBsAg in the circulation for more than six months. Carriers \\nare of two types: \\n1. Super carriers: They have HBeAg, high titres of HBsAg and DNA polymerase \\nin their blood. HBV may also be demonstrable in their blood. Very minute amount of serum \\nor blood from such carriers can transmit the infection. \\n2. Simple carriers: These are more common types of carriers who have low level \\nof HBsAg and no HBeAg, HBV and DNA polymerase in the blood. They transmit the \\ninfection only when large volumes of blood are transferred as in blood transfusion.THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 245 \\nTABLE 15 \\nSerological Markers of Hepatitis B Inf~ction \\nClinical condition Serological marker \\nHBsAg HBeAg Anti-HBs Anti-HBe Anti-HBc HBV DNA \\nIgM IgG \\nIncubation period \\nAcute hepatitis \\nChronic active hepatitis \\nAsymptomatic carrier state \\nPast infection \\n+ \\n+ \\n+ \\n+ \\nImmunization without infection -\\nProphylaxis \\n+ \\n+ \\n+ \\n+ \\n+ + + \\n+ + + \\n+ + \\n+ + \\n+ \\nMeasures for the control of HBV infection are the same as those for HIV infection \\ni.e. screening of blood donors, use of sterile disposable syringes and needles by the medical \\npersonnel and parenteral drug users, reduction of the number of sexual partners, the use \\nof condoms, etc. Medical personnel should wear gloves, gowns, masks and eyeglasses \\nto prevent exposure to blood and body fluids, avoidance of mouth - pipetting, eating or \\nsmoking in the place of work and proper hand washing after work.

Passive immunization is also effective in reducing the risk of the \\ncarrier state in babies born to infectious mothers. HBIG must be given as early as possible \\nbut not later than 12 hours after birth. When this is repeated at monthly intervals for \\nup to six months, the proportion of babies who become carriers can be reduced by about \\n70%. \\nGreater protection is provided by combined passive and active immunization in post \\nexposure prophylaxis. It is advisable to give the injections into different sites. Babies also \\nrespond to vaccine. The protective efficacy of the combined treatment is 90%. \\nlike: \\nActive Immunization: Immunization against HBV is required for high risk individuals \\n• health care personnel especially those in direct contact with blood and sharp \\ninstruments. \\n• patients & health care personnel of institutions for the mentally retarded. \\n• patients requiring repeated transfusion of blood and blood products.246 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n• patients on maintenance dialysis. \\n• patients receiving prolonged inpatient treatment \\n• patients who require frequent tissue penetration \\n• parenteral drug users \\n• sexually promiscuous individuals and prostitutes, and \\n• spouses of those known to be infected with HBV. \\nFollowing vaccines are available: \\n1. Plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine: It consists of purified 22 nm particles of \\nHBsAg, prepared from the plasma of symptomless carriers. The particles are separated \\nby ultracentrifugation and treated with proteinase, 8 M urea and formaldehyde. The \\nchemical treatment inactivates HBV, HIV and other contaminating viruses. The product \\nis immunogenic and safe. This vaccine is still being produced and used, particularly in \\ndeveloping countries where the need is greatest. \\n2. Recombinant yeast hepatitis B vaccine: It is produced by cloning the HBsAg \\ngene in yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisae and the HBsAg particles produced are extracted and \\npurified for use as vaccine. This vaccine is safe, antigenic, free from side effects and as \\nimmunogenic as plasma-derived vaccine. \\nBoth vaccines are absorbed with aluminium hydroxide as adjuvant, stored in cold \\nbut not frozen and are injected intramuscularly into the deltoide regions in a course of \\nthree doses given at 0, 1 and 6 months. Care should be taken to avoid injection into fat \\nas this may produce poorer seroconversion rates. \\n3. Recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell hepatitis vaccine: Expression \\nsystem of CHO cells has been successfully used and the product is commercially available. \\nT~is is the first vaccine using mammalian cell expression system. \\n4. Synthetic peptide vaccines: As the name indicates these are chemically synthesized \\npolypeptide vaccines. These are safe and cheap. These are still under ~xperimental stage. \\n5. Hybrid virus vaccine: Potential live vaccines using recombinant vaccinia virus \\nhave been prepared for hepatitis B, influenza, rabies, epsteinbarr and human \\nimmunodeficiency viruses. Recombinant vaccines can be generated by incorporating \\nforeign genes (HBsAg sequences in case of HBV) into vaccinia virus DNA. Animal cells \\nare first infected with vaccinia virus. Subsequently, a plasmid containing the foreign gene \\nof interest and promotor and thymidine kinase sequences from vaccinia virus is introduced. \\nDuring replication of vaccinia virus DNA, the plasmid sequences are also replicated and \\nchimeric viral DNA containing the foreign gene is produced. Recombinant vaccinia virus \\nexpresses proteins (HBsAg in case of HBV) encoded by foreign gene. The advantages of \\nvaccinia virus recombinant vaccine include low cost, long shelf-life and possible use of \\npolyvalent antigens. \\nHepatitis C Virus (HCV) \\nHCV infection is seen only in humans. The source of infection is the large number \\nof carriers about 200 million world wide. A virus of growing importance, hepatitis C virus, \\n•THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 247 \\nbelongs to the family Flaviviridae. It measures 30-60 nm in diameter. It can be inactivated \\nby exposure to chloroform, ether and other organic solvents and by detergents. Its genome \\nconsists of a single 9.4 kb molecule of ssRNA of positive polarity (Table). A comparison \\nof HCV genomic sequences from around the world has shown substantial heterogeneity \\nof nucleotide sequences within several regions of the viral genomes. On the basis of these \\ngenomic differences, HCV has been classified into 11 genotypes and each genotype has \\nseveral subtypes. This makes vaccine development difficult. Only a polyvalent vaccine \\ncontaining several genotypes is likely to be protective. HCV is difficult to grow in tissue \\nculture. It has been proposed that hepatitis C & G should be placed in a separate genus \\nof the family Flaviviridae to be called Hepacivirns. \\nHCV transmission occurs by needlestick injuries or cuts with sharps, use of \\ncontaminated needles and syringes, transfusion of unscreened blood and sexual intercourse. \\nHCV can be transmitted in utero, during parturition and by breast milk. Transmission \\nby saliva and tears cannot be excluded. HCV transmission from a conjunctival blood \\nsplash has also been reported. Infection is mainly by blood transfusion and other modes \\nof contact with infected blood/blood products. HCV is reported to be an important cause \\nof chronic liver disease in South India. \\nIncubation period of hepatitis C averages 6-8 weeks though it may range upto several \\nmonths. About 75% infections are subclinical. The danger from hepatitis C is not the acute \\ndisease but the persistence of infection. As compared to hepatitis B, clinical infection with \\nhepatitis C is generally less severe, has shorter preicteric period, milder symptoms, absent \\nor less marked jaundice, somewhat lower serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels \\nand the case-fatality rate from fulminant hepatitis is 1 % or less. \\nHowever, 85% or more of the acute HCV infections become chronic. The affected \\nindividuals have persistence of the virus in their blood, elevated ALT levels for at least \\na year or two or more and they are at risk, just as in hepatitis B, of developing cirrhosis \\nand hepatocellular carcinoma. \\nDiagnosis of HCV infection can be established by detection of anti-HCV by ELISA, \\nviral genome by PCR, and by immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization on biopsy \\nand autopsy specimens. \\nProphylaxis \\nHCV infection can be prevented by screening of blood donors, (ivoidance of use of \\nunsterile needles for intravenous drug abuse, tattooing and for medical and dental \\nprocedures. Many of the public health measures adopted to prevent transmission of human \\nimmunodeficiency virus and HBV by parenteral routes will assist efforts at controlling HCV. \\nHepatitis D Virus (HDV) \\nIn 1977 Rizzetto and Colleagues in Italy identified a new viral antigen in the liver \\ncell nuclei of patients infected with hepatitis B virus. The HOV is a defective satellite virus \\nrequiring HBV as helper virus. It is sphereical , 36-38 nm in diameter with HBsAg coat \\n& HOAg nucleoprotein. The genome consists of a single small circular molecule of minus ~ \\nsense RNA of 1.7 kilobase pairs. It encodes its own nucleoproteins, the delta antigen o~248 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nHDAg, but the outer capsid (HBsAg) of HDV virion is encoded by the genome HBV \\ncoinfecting the same cell. Replication of HDV requires the concomitant expression of HBV \\ngene products, therefore, HBV is necessary for the production of HDV virions. It belongs \\nto the genus Deltavirus. Its mode of transmission is same for HBV. Two types of infection \\nviz coinfection and super infection. In coinfection delta and HBV are transmitted together \\nat the some time. In superinfection delta infection occurring in a person already harbouring \\nHBV. Coinfection clinically presents mild to fulminant disease super infection leads to \\nserious and chronic illness. \\nPathogenesis \\nHOV is transmitted principally by blood and blood products, but also by sexual \\ncontact. Vertical transmission is also possible. \\nTwo types of HDV infections are possible: \\n1. Simultaneous coinfection with HBV & HDV in the same inoculum. It most \\ncommonly results from parenteral transmission, for example, in intravenous drug users. \\nThe clinical and biochemical features of such infection resemble those of actue hepatitis \\nB alone. However, coinfection with HBV and HDV may be more severe than the disease \\ncaused by HBV alone. \\n2. Superinfection of an HBsAg carrier by HDV. It is commoner and more serious \\nbecause a large number of hepatocytes are already producing HBsAg, and HDV can \\nreplicate without delay with a relatively short incubation period. It leads to severe liver \\ndamage, fulminant HBsAg positive hepatitis and elevated mortality (upto 20%) \\nIn simultaneous acute HBV & HDV infections, IgM anti-HBc will be detectable, while \\nin acute HDV infection superimposed on chronic HBV infections, anti-HBc will be of IgG \\nclass. \\nLaboratory Diagnosis \\nIn patients with HBV-HOV coinfections, shortly before tlle end of incubation period, \\nHBsAg appears in the serum and towards the end of incubation period HDAg appears \\nwhich can be detected by ELISA or immunoblotting and HDA RNA can be detected by \\nhybridization to a radio labeled RNA probe. In the later stages of \\nacute disease, anti-HD IgM appears followed by anti-HDIgG. These can be detected by \\nELISA. \\nProphylaxis \\nHDV infection can be prevented by prevention of coinfection witll HBV or of \\nsuperinfection of HBV carriers and hence requires all the measures that apply to the \\nprevention of HBV infection, including vaccination against HBV, HOV vaccine might be \\nof use in patients chronically infected with HBV. \\nHepatitis E Virus (HEV) \\nHepatitis E virus belongs to the family CaIiciviridae. Virions of HEV are spherical,THE ANIMAL VIRUSES 249 \\nnon enveloped and 27-38 run in diameter. They possess single-stranded positive sense \\nRNA genome of 7.6 kb which is surrounded by icosahedral capsid with characteristic \\nsurface depressions. HEV is a spherical non enveloped virus, 32-34 run in diameter with \\nsingle stranded RNA genome. The surface of virion shows indentation and spikes. The \\nvirus is very labile. \\nPathogenesis \\nA substantial proportion of cases of acute viral hepatitis occurring in young to \\nmiddle-aged adults in Asia and the Indian subcontinent appear to be caused by HEV. \\nHepatitis E has been shown to occur in epidemics, endemics and sporadic forms almost \\nexclusively in the less developed parts of the world. It is primarily associated with \\ningestion of faecally contaminated drinking water. It was first documented in New Delhi, \\nIndia, in 1955, when 29,000 cases of icteric hepatitis were identified following widespread \\nfaecal contamination of the city's drinking water. A similar epidemic of hepatitis E \\noccurred between December 1975 and January 1976 in Ahmedabad city, India, again due \\nto contaminated water supplies. Many similar water-borne outbreaks have been recorded \\nsubsequently from Indian subcontinent (Nepal and Pakistan), Southeast Asia (Burma and \\nIndonesia), Central Asis (Kirgiz Republic and China), Africa (Algeria, Ivory coast, Chad, \\nSudan & Somalia) and North America (Mexico). \\nIncubation period of hepatitis E ranges from 2-8 weeks, with an average of 5-6 weeks. \\nIt occurs predominantly in the 15-40 years age group. Clinically, the disease closely \\nresembles that of hepatitis A. however, bilirubin levels tend to be higher and jaundice \\ndeeper and more prolonged. The case-fatality rate is 0.5-3% but in infected pregnant \\nwomen it varies from 10-20%. Like hepatitis A, hepatitis E does not progress to chronic \\nhepatitis, cirrhosis, cancer or carrier state. In contrast to HA V, HEV has considerable \\nimplications in pregnancy. It may cause intrauterine and perinatal infections. HEV \\ninfection during pregnancy may cause a high rate of abortion and intrauterine death and \\nincrease perinatal mortality in babies born to women with fulminant hepatitis. \\nProphylaxis \\nHepatitis E can be prevented by improved standards of sanitation and provision \\nof chlorinated water throughout the developing world. During the epidemic, take boiled \\nwater and only cooked food. No vaccine or effective antiviral drugs exist. \\nHepatitis G Virus (HGV) \\nHepatitis G virus represents a newly discovered virus. It has been proposed that \\nhepatitis C and G should be placed in a separate genus of the family Flaviviridae to be \\ncalled Hepacivirus. HGV is distinct from HCV and newly discovered GBV-A and GBV\\xad\\nB agents, however, GBV-C represents an isolate of HGV. Both the GBV-A and GBV-B \\nviruses are considered animal viruses while HGV jGBV-C has been found in humans and \\nin experimentally infected animals. HGV was cloned from the serum of a patient suffering \\nfrom chronic hepatitis who had a history of parenteral exposure. He was negative for \\nHBV and initially also negative for HCV, but later on was found to have an HCV variant250 TEXT BOOK ,OF MICROBIOLOGY \\ngenotype IV. In order to identify the new virus, nucleic acid from the plasma of the patient \\nwas first amplified using a modified polymerase chain reaction and then cloned into an \\nexpression vector. The recognition of the clone producing viral antigen was done by \\nimmunological methods. \\nThe genome of HGV consists of 9.4 kb molecule of ssRNA of positive polarity. Its \\nstructure resembles that of HCV, but it has <25% homology with HCV. HGV replicates \\nin peripheral blood cells, however, its replication in the liver is not known. The virus \\nis transmitted parentally (exposure to blood through transfusions, haemodialysis, or \\nsharing equipment in injecting drugs use), sexually and for mother to child. More than \\n30% of transfusion recipients and upto 80% of injecting drugs users are HGV marker \\npositive. HGV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) share same infection routes, and \\na significant proportion of HIV-infected subjects are HGV-coinfected. \\nThe virus is present worldwide. Majority of the individuals with HGV infection have \\nno detectable evidence of liver disease. There have been, however, cases of acute, fulminant \\nand chronic hepatitis where HGV is presently the only explanation for their liver disease. \\nThere is no evidence of a causal relationship between HGV infection .and hepatocellular \\ncarcinoma. HGV infection results frequently in chronic viraemia. It often subsides after \\nseveral years and anti-HGenv antibody develops. \\nHGV infection is mainly detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction \\n(RT-PCR). Recently, an immunoassay has been developed to detect anti-HGenv, Serum \\nHGV RNA indicates viraemia, whereas anti-HGenv is associated with recovery. These \\ncan be found respectively in <2 % and 9% of healthy blood donors. Prevalence increases \\nin association with HCV or HBV infection. HGV infection can be prevented by employing \\nthe same measures as for HBV, HCV and HIV. \\n000ARCHAEA \\nThe term Archaea (Greek archaios = ancient) is a group of prokaryotes which is \\nquite different from Eubacteria in several morphological and biochemical traits. The \\narchaebacteria are not a homogenous group but is a collection of disparate phenotypes: \\nthe methanogens, the extreme halophiles (organism that can grow in concentrated salt \\nsolutions) and extreme thermophilic sulphur metabolizing species. \\nMorphologically it canbe spherical, rod-shaped, spiraL lobed, plate shaped, irregularly \\nshaped or pleomorphic. Some are single celled, whereas other form filaments or \\naggregates. They range in diameter from 0.1 to 151-lm and some can grow in 200l-lm \\nin length. \\nArchaea are generally found in extreme aquatic and terrestrial habitats. They are \\noften present in anaerobic, hypersaline or high-temperature environments and also in \\ncold environments. Archaea constitute upto 34% of prokaryotic biomass in Costal \\nAntarctic surface waters and few as a syptbiont in animal digestive systems. \\nPHYLOGENY \\nPhylogenetically the domain Archaea tree splits into two major phyla called the \\nCrenarchaeota and Euryarchaecota. Two other phyla called Korarchaeota and \\nNanoarchaeota branch of close to the root. Phyla Crenarchaeota contain mostly \\nhyper thermophilic species whose optimum growth temperature is greater than BODe. \\nThese hyperthermophiles are chemolithotrophic autotrophs and these organisms are, \\nthe only primary producers in these harsh environments. The 165 rRNA sequencing \\nsuggest that these organisms are more slowly evolving than other lineages in the \\ndomain. \\nPhyla Euryarchaeota includes methanogenic Archaea-whose metabolism is linked252 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLQG¥ \\nto the production of methane (CH 4) and extreme halophiles.

Sometimes they are found in extreme cold environments. \\nThe extreme environment conditions include high temperature, low temperature, \\nlow acidic pH value, high alkaline value, high salt concentration, low water \\navailability, high irradiation which include hot springs, salt lakes, antarctic \\ndesert soils. \\n(3) They are Gram positive or Gram negative and may be spherical, rod shaped, \\nlobed, spiral or plate like or pleomorphic. The size ranges from 0.1-15 J.Ull. \\n(4) They multiply by binary fission, budding, fragmentation or other mechanisms. \\n(5) Nutritionally they are either aerobic, facultative anaerobic or strictly anaerobic, \\nchemolithoautotroph to organotrophs. The autotroph has the ability to fix CO 2 \\nby reverse TCA cycle or by reductive acetyl CoA pathway-leading to \\nproduction of glucose via pyruvate. \\n(6) The Gram positive forms have a thick wall made up of N-acetylglucosamine \\nand L-amino acids while N-acetyl muramic acid and D-amino acids are absent \\nand hence they are resistant to lysozyme and penicillin. The Gram negative254 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\narchaebacteria have a relatively thick protein or glycoprotein cell wall but the \\nouter membrane is absent. \\n(7) The plasma membrane of archaea differs from that of eubacteria and \\neukaryote in having branched chain hydrocarbon attached to glycerol, \\nconnected by ether links (not straight chain fatty acids connected by ester \\nlinks as in eubacteria). \\n(8) The archaebacterial chromosome is a single circular DNA molecule as in \\neubacteria but smaller in length (mol. weight of 0.8 to 1.1 x 109 daltons, \\ncompared to 2.5 x 109 dalton). \\n(9) The T \\\\jI C arm of archaeal tRNA lacks thymine and contains pseudouridine \\nor 1-methyl pseudouridine. \\n(10) The first amino acid to initiate a new polypeptide chain is methionine in \\narchaeobacteria where as it is N-formylmethionine in eubacteria. \\n(11) The eubacteria are sensitive to chloramphenicol while the archaebacteria are \\nnot. While the diphtheria toxin affects archaebacteria but not eubacteria. \\n(12) The variation in G + C content is great (21-68% of molecular weight) \\n(13) The archaeobacteria have few plasmids. \\n(14) The archaebacterial mRNA is more similar to eubacteria than to eukaryotic \\nmRNA. \\n(15) Some methanogens have histone like protein that bends with DNA to form \\nnucleosome like structure. \\n(16) The archaebacteria, specially methanogens contain unusual coenzymes which \\ndo not occur in eubacteria like coenzyme F420, F430, Methanofuran, \\nMethanopterin, and co-enzyme -M. \\n(17) The extreme halophiles are only photosynthetic archaebacteria and convert \\nlight energy into chemical energy by means of a proton pump based on a \\npigment bacteriorhodopsin. \\nTHE ARCHAEBACTERIAL CELL WALL \\nAs we know that archaebacteria are either Gram + ve or Gram -ve. Thus there \\nis considerable variety in the cell wall of archaebacteria. The cell wall structurally and \\nchemically differ from that of eubacteria. The Gram positive archaebacteria have a single \\nuniform thick homogenous cell wall layer like of eubacteria while the gram negative \\narchaebacteria lack the outer membrane and complex peptidoglycan network like that \\nof Gram negative eubacteria. \\nChemically the archaebacterial cell wall differ from eubacteria. They do not contain \\nmuramic acid and D-amino acid (characteristic feature of eubacterial peptidoglycan) but \\ncontain NAG (N-acetyl glucosamine) and L-amino acid. Some methanogens like \\nMethanobacterium contain a peptidoglyan like material called pseudopeptidoglycan or \\npseudomurin which contains an alternating repeats of N-acetyl glucosamine and N\\xad\\nacetyltalosamino uronic acid (unique to archaebacteria) which has L-amino acids in itsARCHAEA 255 \\ncross links and 13 (1-3) glycosidic bonds instead of 13 (1-4) glycosidic bonds. Because \\nof their structural difference the cell walls of archaebacteria are resistant to the action \\nof lysozyme. \\nMethanosarcina sps. contain a complex polysaccharide the major sugar in this being \\ngalactosamine, glucuronic acid and glucose. Halococcus an extreme halophile contains \\na sulphated polysaccharide made of sugars glucose, mannose and galactose. Along with \\nthis a great amount of negatively charged acidic amino acids which serve to balance \\nthe abundance of positive charges generated by the high concentration of sodium in \\nthe organism's environment (about 20-25% NaCl). \\nMethanococcus and Methanomicrobium lack carbohydrates in the cell walls and \\ncontain only protein. Sulfolobus cell walls are made of glycoprotein and can remain, intact \\nin boiling detergent solutions. The cell wall of Pyrodictium (which can with stand 110°C \\nthe most thermophilic organism) is also made of glycoprotein. \\nIn the Gram negative archaebacteria the outer membrane is absent and have a \\nrelatively thick protein and glycoprotein outside the plasma membrane. The layer is \\n20- 40 nm. The chemical content varies considerably some methanogens, Halobacterium \\nand several extreme thermophiles viz. Sulfolobus, Thenlloproteus have glycoproteins in \\ntheir walls. In contrast, other methanogens Methanococcus, Methallomicrobium and \\nDesuifurococcus have protein walls. \\nARCHAEBACfERIAL LIPIDS AND MEMBRANE \\nThe plasma membrane of archaebacteria differs from that of eubacteria and \\neukaryotes. The plasma membrane lipids of archaebacteria have branched chain \\nhydrocarbon attached to glycerol by ether links rather than fatty acid connected by ester \\nlinks as in eubacteria. Sometimes two glycerol groups are linked to form an extremely \\nlong tetraethers. Glycerol diethers and glycerol tetraethers are major classes of lipid \\npresent in archaebacteria. \\nThe lipids are polar lipids which are present in archaebacterial membrane like \\nphospholipids, sulfolipids and glycolipids. About 7-30% of membrane lipids are nonpolar \\nlipids (the derivative of squalene). The C 20 diethers can be used to make a regular bilayer \\nmembrane while a more rigid monolayer membrane is constructed of C 40 tetraethers \\nlipids which increases the membrane's mechanical strength and resistance to chemical \\nagent. \\nIn thermoacidophiles one or two cyclopentane ring commonly occurs in C 40 chains \\nand two-OH (adjacent) groups on glycerol moiety are ether linked to these hydrocarbon \\nchains. Thus archaebacterial membranes may contain a mix of diethers, tetraethers and \\nother lipids like thermoacidophiles contain many dibiphytanyl tetraethers, halophiles \\ncontain many diphytanyl diethers and methanagens contain both diphytanyl diethers \\nand dibiphytanyl tetra ethers. The presence of ether linked lipid is such a unique \\ncharacteristic of archaebacteria that this distinctive feature has been used as a biomarker \\nfor detecting archaebacteria in paleontological studies of rocks, sediments cores and other \\nfossil materials.256 \\n(A) \\n(B) \\nTEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nGlycerol Fatty acids \\nr--------------------------------------~ 10 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 \\n: III '\\\\1 '\\\\ I '\\\\ I '\\\\ I '\\\\1 '\\\\1 '\\\\1 '\\\\1 \\nH2C-0~C CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 \\n:0 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 \\n: III '\\\\1 '\\\\ I '\\\\ I ,\\\\1 \\\\1 \\\\1 ,\\\\1 '\\\\1 \\nHC-OrC CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 \\nt---------------------------------10 \\nI II \\nI \\n~C-OTP-O-R \\nI I \\nL----JO \\nGlycerol Fatty acids \\n~----.------------------------------~ I CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 \\nI I I I I I \\nI H 2C-0..1.CH2 CH CH 2 CH CH 2 CH CH 2 CH \\n: '\\\\1\\\\1\\\\1\\\\1'\\\\1\\\\1\\\\1\\\\ \\nI CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 \\nCH 3 CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 \\nI I I I \\nHC-0.LCH 2 CH CH 2 CH CH 2 CH CH 2 CH \\n: '\\\\1 \\\\1 '\\\\1 \\\\1 '\\\\1 \\\\1 '\\\\1 \\\\ \\nI CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 \\n~------------------------------\\n10 \\nIII \\nI \\nHC-OTP-O-R \\n2 I I \\nL ____ JO \\nFig. 3 : Structure of membrane lipids.

The second edition of \\nBergey's Manual divides the archaea into two phyla the Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota \\neach with several orders. The classification was based on rRNA data. The term \\nCrenarchaeota [Greek Crene, spring or fount and archaeos) and Euryarchaeota [Greek \\nEurus wide and = archaios = ancient or primitive) divided the archaea at the phyla \\nlevel. The Crenarchaeote are thought to resemble the ancestor of the archaea and almost \\nall the species are thermophiles or hyperthermophiles. The phylum Crenarchaeota is \\ndivided into one class. Thermoprotei and four order Thermoproteales, Sulfolobales, \\nDesulfurococcales and Calidisphaerales. \\nThermoproteales contains Gram-ve, anaerobic to facultative hyperthermophilic rods. \\nThey often grow chemolithoautotrophically by reducing sulphur to hydrogen sulfide. \\nMembers of the order Sulfolobales are coccus shaped thermoacidophiles. The order \\nDesulfurococcales contain Gram negative coccoid or disk shaped hyperthermophiles. \\nThey grow either chemolithotrophically by hydrogen oxidation or organotrophically by \\neither fermentation or respiration with sulphur as the electron acceptor. \\nThe Euryarchaeotes are given the name because they occupy different ecological \\nniches and have a variety of metabolic patterns. This phylum is very diverse with seven \\nclasses. (Methanobacteria, Methanococci, Halobacteria, Thermoplasmata, Thermococci, \\nArchaeglobi and Methanopyri), nine orders and 15 families. Methanogens are the \\ndominant physiological group and largest group with a great practical importance \\nbecause methane is a clean burning fuel and an excellent energy source. \\nPHYLUM-CRENARCHAEOTA \\nMost of the Crenarchaeotes are extremely thermophilic and many are acidophilic \\nand sulphur dependent. Almost all are strict anaerobes. They grow in geothermally \\nheated water or soils that contain elemental sulphur. The sulphur may be used either \\nas an electron acceptor in aerobic respiration or as an e- source by lithotrophs. The \\nmembers are scattered all over the world for ego the sulphur rich hot springs in \\nYellowstone National park, Wyoming and water surrounding areas of submarine \\nvolcanic activity. Such habitats are called Solfatara. These archaea can be very \\nthermophilic and often are classified as hyperthermophiles. The phylum include a single \\nclass Thermoprotei, with 4 orders, Thermoproteales, Calidisphaerales, Desulfurococales \\nand Sulfoiobaies. \\nThermoproteus the member of order Thermoproteales is a long thin rod that can \\nbe bent or branched. Its cell wall is composed of glycoprotein. It is strict anaerobic and \\ngrows at temperature from 70-97°C and pH values between 2.5 to 6.5. It is found in \\nhot springs and other hot aquatic habitats rich in sulfur. It can grow organotrophically \\nand oxidize glucose, amino acids, alcohols and organic acids with elemental sulfur as \\nthe electron acceptor. CO or CO 2 act as sole carbon source. \\nSulfolobus is a facultative chemoautotroph found extensively all over the world in \\nhot acid springs and soils. The cells are irregularly lobate spherical.

Although \\nit can grow on organic compounds (organotrophically) but in its natural habitats it \\nprobably grows as a respiratOlY chemoautotroph. Geothermal steam or hot water leaches \\nmuch amounts of iron and sulphide which is rapidly oxidized to elemental sulphur \\nby oxygen or ferric ion, either chemically or biologically: This bacterium rapidly oxidizes \\nH 2S. This ability of Sulfolobus to oxidize Fe+2 to Fe+3 anaerobically has been used quite \\nsuccessfully in high temperature bioleaching of iron and copper ores. Sulfolobus cells \\nare spherical, Gram - ve, aerobic irregulary lobed and cell walls are mainly composed \\nof protein. Cells adhere tightly to sulphur crystals where they can be visualized \\nmicroscopically using fluorescent dyes. Their cell wall contains lipoprotein and \\ncarbohydrate but lacks peptidoglycan. Oxygen is the normal electron acceptor. Sugar \\nand amino acid such as glutamate also serve as carbon and energy sources. They are \\ngenerally classified as thermoacidophiles. \\nPyrodictium: It is a sub-marine volcanic extreme thermophile which is of great \\ninterest because of its ability to grow at temperature upto 110°C (Optimum 105°C). Cells \\nof Pyrodictium are irregularly disc-shaped and grow in cultures as a mold like layer \\nupon sulphur crystals on the medium. The cell mass consists of a network of fibres \\nto which cells are attached. The fibres are hollow and consist of proteinaceous subunits \\nsimilar to that of flagellin protein of eubacterial flagellum. It is strict anaerobe that grows \\nlithotrophically on H2 and S at 82-110°C. The cell envelope consists of glycoprotein. \\nPicrophilus: The genus was isolated from moderately hot solfataric fields in Japan. \\nIt lacks a regular cell wall but has an S-layer outside its plasma membrane. The cells \\ngrows as irregularly shaped cocci, 1.5 flm in diameter and have large cytoplasmic cavities \\nthat are not membrane bounded. The genus is aerobic and grows between 47-65°C. The \\noptimum pH is 0.7 \\nPhylum-Euryarchaeota \\nThis phylum is very diverse phylum with many classes (nine according to 2nd \\nedition of Bergey's manual), viz. Methanobacteria, Methanococci, Methanomicrobia, \\nHalobacteria, Thermoplasmata, Thermococci, Archaeoglobi, Methanopyri. \\nMethanogens occur in various anaerobic habitats rich in organic matter with non\\xad\\nmethanogenic bacteria ferment to produce H2 and CO 2, Thus the methanogens form \\nthe consortia in association with other microorganisms which not only provide CO 2 and \\nfatty acids required. The habitat like marshes, swamps, pond and lake mud marine \\nsediments, the intestinal tract of human and animals, the rumen of cattle and anaerobic \\nsludge digesters in sewage treatment systems are ideal for these archaebacteria. These \\nmicrobes are unable to use carbohydrate, proteins or other complex organic substrates. \\nThe methanogens obtain energy by converting CO 2, H 2, formate, methanol, acetate \\nand other compounds to produce either methane or CO 2, This is the largest group of \\narchaea which differ greatly in overall shape, 16srRNA sequence, cell wall chemistry \\nand structure, membrane lipids. For example methanogens construct three different types \\nof cell wall. The most complex is that of group I which is rigid and composed chiefly \\nof pseudomurin (it contain N-acetyl talosaminuronic acid instead of N-acetylmuramicARCHAEA 261 \\nacid and lack D-amino acids). In appearance the wall resembles those of Gram + ve \\neubacteria. In groupes II the wall is flexible and composed chiefly of proteins with traces \\nof glucosamine. While the group III has the most complex cell wall. It is flexible \\ncomposed of at least two layers, an inner electron dense of unknown chemistry and \\nouter one appearing like a membrane in cross section but composed entirely of protein. \\nThe order Methanobacteriales consists of the genera Methanobacterium, \\nMetJumobrevibacter, Metlumosphaera and Methanothennus. The Methanomicrobiales contains \\nsarcinoid forms and some spirilla. The sarcinae can utilize acetate and sometimes methyl \\namines for methane production. They contain cytochrome b or c or both. The most \\nunusual methanogenic group is the genus Methallopyrus which is extremely thermophilic, \\nrod shaped methanogen from marine hydrothermal vent.

It absorb IR \\nradiation and is a green house gas and this significantly promote future global warming. \\nHalobacteria \\nThe extreme halophiles or halobacteria (class Halobacteria) is another group of \\narchaea, currently with 15 genera. It has a single family Halobacteriaceae. They are \\naerobic chemoheterotrophs and require complex nutrients usually proteins and amino \\nacids for growth. All the members of this family are obligate halophiles growing in \\nmedia containing at least 15% NaCl. These members are found in the ecosystem which \\nhave extremely high NaCl concentration like salt lakes, the dead sea and salt preserved \\nfoods. The salt lakes occur in arid regions where evaporation exceeds fresh water inflow, \\nor a lake which is fed by a salt spring. The cell wall of these organism is so dependent \\non the presence of NaCl that it disintegrate when NaCl concentration drops to about \\n1.5 M. The cell wall of HalococclIs are composed of a complex heteropolysaccharide which \\nis stable even at low salt concentration. The major component of cell wall of Halobacterium \\nis a large acidic glycol protein. Its glycan component consist of 22-24 disaccharide linked \\nvia - 0 - glycosidic bond to threionine residues, 12-14 trisaccharide. Also o-li:lked to \\nthrionine and a single heterooligosaccharide in N-glycosidic linkage to aspargine. In \\naddition to the glycoprotein the cell envelope contains nonglycosylated protein and \\nglycolipid. They can also grow in food products such as salted fish and cause spoilage. \\nThey can reach such high population levels that salts lakes, salterns and salted fish \\nactually turn red. The best studied member of the family is Halobacterium salinarium \\nwhich is especial because it can trap light energy photosynthetically with the help of262 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\na special pigment called bacteriorhodopsin. Bacteriorhodopsin is a protein pigment, \\nbecause . of its functional similarity to the visual pigment of eye called rhodopsin, \\nconjugated to bacteriorhodopsin is a molecule of retinal, a carotene like molecule which \\ncan absorb light and catalyse the transfer of protons across the cytoplasmic membrane. \\nThe cell membrane of Halobacterium appears purple due to the presence of the pigment \\nbacteriorhodopsin. When a cell containing the pigment are exposed to light the pigment \\nbleaches. During this bleaching H+ (protons) are extruded to the outside of the membrane \\nand generate a proton motive force which drives ATP synthesis. The absorption spectra \\nof bacteriorhodopsin appears at 570 nm. The Halobacteria also contain cytochrome and \\nferredoxins. The genus Halobacterium has four rhodopsins each with separate function. \\nHalorhodopsin uses light energy to transport chloride ions into the cell and maintain \\na 4-5 M intracellular KCI concentration. Two other rhodopsin act as photoreceptor one \\nfor red and one for blue light. \\nThe halobacteria are Gram negative with the shape ranges from rod to disc shaped, \\npolarly flagellated cells viz. Halobacterium or immotile cocci (Halococcus). The colonies \\nare red to orange in colour because of carotene like pigments. \\nThe genome of Halobacteriwn and Halococcus contain two components with different \\npercentage of G + C values. Majority of DNA has a G + C content of 66-68%. The \\ntotal genome size of Halobacterium is 2.5 x 109 which contains a large number of different \\nrepeated sequences upto 5,000 bp in length. \\nThe group thermococcales are strictly anaerobic and can reduce sulfur to sulfide. \\nThey are motile and have optimum growth temperature 88-100°C. It contains two genera \\nThermococcus and Pyrococcus. This group is also known as extremely thermophilic SO \\nmetabolizers. \\nThe group Archaeoglobales has a single family with single genus Arcllaeoglobus. \\nThis group is also known as sulfate reducing archaea. The organism is Gram -ve, \\nirregular coccoid. Cells with cell wall containing glycoprotein subunits. It can extract \\nelectron from a variety of electron donars (like H 2, lactate, glucose) and reduce sulfate, \\nsulfite or thiosulfate to sulfide. The species is extremely thermophilic (optimum 83°C). \\nIt possess the methanogen, coenzyme F420 and methanopterin. \\nEVOLUTION \\nEvolutionarily all the organism of the group archaea is assumed to be descendent \\nfrom a common ancestor the progenote (the organism might be primitive, cellular, with \\nrudimentary not well coordinated translation apparatus or might be an archae bacterium). \\nAs a group they are collection of diverse groups of organism. The unifying feature being \\ntheir adaptation to extremes of environmental conditions like extreme pH, temperature, \\nsalinity. Considering that early earth had such extreme environmental condition \\narchaebacteria appears to be the early forms of life on earth. It is suggested that \\narchaebacteria are more primitive than eubacteria and evolved at slower rate than both \\ni.e. the eubacteria and eukaryotes. \\nDODMYCOPLASMA \\nIn living organisms, some diseases are caused by very small microorganism called \\nMycoplasma. These organism are the smallest free living cell known much similar to \\nother microorganism like bacteria, chlamydea, rickettsia and viruses. \\nMycoplasmas and prokaryotes, without cell wall have been placed under the class \\nmollicutes (Latin mollis = soft, pliable + cutis = stain) and the order Mycoplasmatales. \\nMycoplasmas or mollicutes (soft skin) are without cell wall and are \\'bounded by triple \\nlayered membrane. They are smallest microorganism which have been known to cause \\na number of diseases in animals and human being. Louis Pasteur first noticed them \\nwhile observing the causative agent of pleuropneumonia in culture. He was unable to \\nisolate them in a pure culture medium. Nocard and Roux (1898) of Pasteur\\'s laboratory \\ncultured the microorganism in media containing serum and demonstrated that the \\npleomorphic microbes could produce the \\ndisease in inoculated healthy cattle. These \\nwere pleomorphic and were called PPLO \\n(Pleuropneumonia like organism).

They are sensitive to supersonic vibrations \\ndesiccations and most of the physical environment factors. \\n(6) The colony of mycoplasma on solid agar medium appears as just like fried \\negg under stereo microscope. The colony shows spherical or hemispherical portion in \\nthe centre, which is surrounded by stlrface growth towards periphery. The typical colony \\nis biphasic with a fried egg appearance (characterized by opaque, granular central area \\nwith a transleucent peripheral zone). \\n(7) They are susceptible to lysis by osmotic shocks caused by sudden dilution of \\nthe medium with water.MYCOPLASMA 265 \\n(8) They can be cultivated in vitro on non-living media of rich composition as \\nfacultative anaerobes or obligate anaerobes. \\n(9) The genome size of mycoplasmas are about 1/5 to 1/2 thz size of those of \\nbacteria. \\n(10) Genetic material is naked circular chromosome of fibrillar (double stranded) \\nDNA, about 3 nm thick with a molecular weight ranges from 44 x 10 to 1200 x 10 \\ndaItons. Guanine: cytosine ratio of DNA ranges from 24-10%. \\n(11) The mode of multiplication is presumed to be by budding or binary fission. \\n(12) Chemically they are much closer to bacteria because they possess 4% DNA \\nand 8% RNA, 70s ribosomes are present in the cytoplasm. \\n(13) Cells are non-motile but gliding motility has been observed in a few species. \\n(14) Mesosomes are not found in the cells of mycoplasma, but plasm ids are found \\non the basis of dry matter 50-80% proteins, 8-17% RNA and 4-7% DNA is present. \\n(15) They do not show response towards Gram staining i.e. they are Gram negative \\nin nature. Stevens & Fox (1979) suggested a rapid and simple technique called Dien\\'s \\nstain for staining technique. \\n(16) They are insensitive to penicillin, vancomycin and cephaloridine (which effect \\non cell wall) but are sensitive toward tetracycline & chloremphenicol (which effect on \\nmetabolic activities) and they have harmful effect on them. \\nCLASSIFICA nON \\nIn 1966, International Committee of Nomenclature of Bacteria, separated mycoplasma \\nfrom bacteria and placed them in class-Mollicutes. (Mollis = flexible, + cutis = stain). \\nEdward & Friendt (1970) have classified Mycoplasma or PPLO under different groups \\non the basis of sterol requirement. \\nClass - Mollicutes \\nOrder - Mycoplasmatales \\nFamily - includes 3 families \\n(i) Mycoplasmataceae - e.g. Mycoplasma \\n(ii) Acholeplasmataceae - e.g. AcllOleplasma \\n(iii) Spiroplasmataceae - e.g. Spiroplasma \\nCELL STRUCTURE \\nThe ultra structure of cell of Mycoplasma appears as prokaryotic unicellular \\nmicroorganism. The outer most boundary of cell is a unit plasma membrane which is \\nthree layered made up of lipoprotein. The chemical nature of lipoprotein consist of \\nphospholipids and cholesterol. This unit membrane is 80-100Ao in thickness and \\nselectively permeable. The membrane surrounds the cytoplasm which is packed with \\n70s ribosomes, R.N.A., naked circular chromosome of fibrillar double stranded DNA \\nof about 3 nm thick, one or more electron dense areas and some empty vacuoles.266 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nOn the basis of dry weight the chemical composition of Mycoplasma is as follows:\\xad\\nProtein - 50-80% \\nLipid - approx 40% \\nRNA - 8-15% \\nDNA - 4-6% \\nMesosomes are not found in the cells of Mycoplasma but plastnids are found 40 \\ndifferent types of enzymes are found in cytoplasm. \\nBecause the Mycoplasma are able to pass through many filters and grow in media \\nwhich do not contain living tissue. They are therefore considered to be microorganism \\nintermediate between bacteria and viruses chemically they are much closer to bacteria. \\nBecause of their special cell structure and physiology various scientist has named \\nMycoplasmas with different nomenclature viz. Joker of microbiology, jocker of plant \\nkingdom, Prokaryote without cell wall, and Bacteria with their coats off. \\nReproduction \\nMorowitz and Tourtelotte (1962) reported the absence of sexual and asexual \\nreproduction in Mycoplasma, but they reproduce by (i) Fragmentation (ii) Budding (iii) \\nYoung elementary bodies \\nFormation of elementary body is an important mode of reproduction in Mycoplasma. \\nThe cells of Mycoplasma laidlawii show unequal division at the time of multiplication, \\nas a result of which elementary bodies of 330-450 Ilm size are formed. They are very \\nminute and can live freely. They are known as primary bodies. These primary bodies \\nincreases in size and shape accordingly called as secondary and tertiary structures. Inside \\nthese larger bodies the elementary bodies are formed and this stage is known as \\nquarternary structure and after the rupturing of larger bodies these are released and \\nthis quarternary structure develops into complete mycoplasma cell. \\nECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF MYCOPLASMA \\nMycoplasma causes many diseases in plants animals and human beings. The \\nimportant ones, caused in plants are as follows: \\nMycoplasmal Plant Diseases : \\n• Little leaf disease of Brinjal. \\n• Bunchy top of Papaya. \\n• Witches broom of Legumes. \\n• Yellow dwarf of Tobacco. \\n• Sandal spike disease. \\n• Sesamum Phyllody. \\n• Stripe disease of Sugarcane. \\n• Witches broom of Potato.MYCOPLASMA 267 \\n• Clover virescence. \\n• Clover phyllody disease. \\n• Cotton virescence. \\nSymptoms of Mycoplasmal Plant Diseases \\n(i) Plant associated with mycoplasma are infected in the sieve tubes of the plants \\ncauses upsetting the hormonal balance resulting in witchs broom growth (all \\nthe axillary buds grows and convert into bunch). \\n(ii) In some cases flower leaf assume the shape of foliage leaves (phyllody) and \\nvarious intermediate stage between flowers and leafy sprouts can be found \\n(antholysis). In many cases no anthocyanin are formed in petal. \\n(iii) Degenerative processes in the sieve tubes of infected plant causes plant \\nstunting, wilting or leaf yellowing and reduction of leaf size. \\n(iv) Colour breaking in the calyx portion of infected flower causes greening of all \\nflower parts (virescence) and transferred into green leaf like structure (Phyllody). \\n(v) Stem become flat in infected plant. \\n(vi) Excessive callose formation and cell necrosis occurs in the sieve tubes of \\ninfected plant which can be visible under a fluorescence microscope after \\nstaining with aniline blue (serves as indirect indication for the presence of \\nmycoplasma). \\nTransmission of Disease \\n(i) Plant mycoplasmas are known to be transmitted by certain insect vectors (leaf \\nhopper) of cicadellidae and psyllidae. Once mycoplasma invade the insects \\nsalivary glands the vectors can transmit these organisms with the help of their \\nsaliva to healthy plants. \\n(ii) By grafting, mycoplasma can be transferred to healthy plant. \\n(iii) With the aid of Cuscuta, mycoplasma can be transferred from diseased to \\nhealthy plants. (with the help of haustoria) but this type of. transmission does \\nnot occur in nature. \\n(iv) An aphid named Acnjthosiphon pisum transmit mycoplasma in Pisum sativum. \\nMycoplasmal Human Diseases \\n(i) Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes the disease primary atypical pneumonia (PAP) \\nin the mouth, pharynx and genitourinary tract. \\n(ii) Ureaplasma ueralyticum have been found in women experiencing repeated or \\nhabitual reproduction failure. \\n(iii) Two species of mycoplasma viz. M. hominis and M. fermentants has been found \\nresponsible for infertility in men. \\n(iv) M. orale and M. salivarium are found responsible for respiratory tract infection. \\n(v) Mycoplasma have also been found in cases of arthritis and inflammation of \\nthe middle ear.268 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMycoplasmal Animal Diseases: \\n(i) Inflammation of genitals in animals is caused by Mycoplasma bovigenitalillm. \\n(ii) Bovine pleuropneumonia in animals is caused by Mycoplasma mycoides. \\n(iii) Agalactia of sheep and goat is caused by Mycoplasma agalactiae. \\n(iv) Sinubitis in hen is caused by Mycoplasma melegridis. \\nThermoplasmas are heat loving mycoplasma. The optimum temperature for growth \\nis 59°C. They are Gram variable. \\nThe genus Thermoplasma grows at a temperature of 55-59°C (max. 62°q and pH \\n2 (minimum 1 to max. 4). The genus is distinct from other extreme thermophiles as \\nit resembles the eubacterial genus Mycoplasma in lacking a cell wall and forming fried \\negg colony. It grows in refuse piles of coal mines which contain iron pyrites (PeS) which \\noxidized to sulphuric acid by lithotrophs. Thennoplasma lacks a cell wall but cell \\nmembrane contains large amounts of lipopolysaccharide and glycoprotein (diglycerol \\ntetraethers). The DNA is stabilized with a histone like protein, thus resembling the \\nchromosome of eukaryote. \\nSpiroplasma are spiral form mycoplasmas. The helical filamentous forms are motile \\nand show rapid rotary or screw motion and slow undulation motion. They are gram \\npositive. \\nMycoplasma resembles L-form in (i) having similar ultrastructure (ii) soft pleomorphic \\ncells devoid of mucopeptide wall (iii) not osmotically fragile (iv) growth on media \\nwithout osmotic protection. They differ from L-forms in the following characters : (i) \\nwhile the L-forms revert to normal cells when the antibiotic is removed, mycoplasma \\nnever synthesizes the wall and (ii) while L-forms are non-pathogenic, mycoplasmas are \\nimportant pathogens. \\nL- form was isolated by Kleinberger Nobel in 1935. The cells were called L- forms \\nafter Lister Institute in London where they were isolated. L-forms are spheroplast like \\nstructure lacking cell wall. These naked protoplast can also be isolated from Salmonella, \\nE. coli and Proteus (both Gram positive and Gram negative) as well as from other bacteria \\nby cultivation on serum agar with penicillin (100 Ilg/ ml) in laboratory conditions. They \\nproduce fried egg type colonies which resemble those of mycoplasma species. Two types \\nof L-forms have been isolated. \\nThe L-form colonies can be lifted and cultured at higher concentration of penicillin \\nas at lower concentrations the L-forms revert to normal bacterial cells with walls. L \\nforms resemble protoplasts and sphaeroplasts in (a) lack of flagella. (b) inability to \\nsporulate (c) lack of some or all cell wall antigens (d) revers on to normal cells when \\nantibiotic treatment is stopped. \\nThe L-forms do not multiply by binary fission. They increase in size (upto 50Il) \\nand than form large number of small (0.1-0.31l) units called elementary corpuscles by \\nfission or budding. \\nThese similarities suggest that in nature, mycoplasma might have originated from \\nL-forms by loss of the capacity of reversion to normal cells. Thus L-forms are closest \\nto mycoplasma, could be thought of as their proginator. \\n000PHYTOPLASMA \\nPhytoplasmas were earlier known as mycoplasma like organisms (MLOs) because \\nof their similarities with mycoplasmas when observed under electron microscope. These \\nare plant parasitic prokaryotes that lack a cell wall and occur in phloem elements of the \\nshoots. The most common symptoms of affected plants are yellowing, phyllody and \\nwitches\\' broom. In India, these have been reported on citrus and coconut plants. \\nMOLLICUTES \\nPresence of cell wall is the fundamental characteristic of bacteria, absence of wall \\nin certain prokaryotic organisms incited some workers to work out their systematic \\nposition. Nocard and their collaborators first cultured a wall less contagious microbe, \\ncausing pleuropneumonia of cattle, on artificial broth in 1898. They observed small \\ncolonies with dark center and light peripheral area that resembled with fried eggs. Like \\nviruses, these microbes were filterable. Cell wall free and filterable prokaryotes discovered \\nuntil 1930s were named as \"Pleuro-Pneumonia like Organisms\" or \"PPLOs\". \\nIn 1960s, these wall-less prokaryotes were given the collective term \"Mycoplasmas\" \\n(Greek noun mycos meaning fungus and the Greek noun plasma meaning something \\nformed or moulded) since it was proposed that all such similar organisms be assigned \\nto the genus Mycoplasma. This terminology became obsolete when new microorganisms \\nsuch as Acholeplasma and Ureaplasma, etc., were being isolated and characterized. Therefore, \\na revised classification scheme was devised whereby all filterable, wall-less prokaryotes \\nwere covered under a broad system called the class-MoIlicutes (from the Latin adjective \\nmollis meaning pliable and the latin noun cutis meaning skin). \\nMollicutes are the smallest biologically self-replicating cells with their diameter \\nbetween 0.30 /lm and 0.80 /lm. Out of all living organisms, the Mollicutes have s~aIIest \\nreported genomes. The size of their genome is as small as 400 MDa. MoUicutes have270 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nevolved specifically from a branch of the phylogenetic tree containing Gram positive \\nbacteria with an unusually low (23-46%) G + C ratio. Although they are equipped with \\nDNA and RNA for performing protein synthesis, but their limited biosynthetic capabilities \\ncreate a huge dependence on their environment. The pleomorphic characteristics of \\nMollicutes range from coccoid to filamentous form, but often demonstrate the characteristic \\n\"Y\" shape appearance. They are able to pass through 0.45 ~m and 0.22 ~m filters \\ncommonly used in biological sterilization. Mycoplasma was the common term for all cell \\nwall less organisms belonging to the Class-Mollicutes. This class encompasses eight \\ngenera, Spiroplasma, Ureaplasma, Mycoplasma, Ac1lOleplasma, Anaeroplasma, Asteroplasma, \\nElltomoplasma and Mesoplasma. \\nPHYfOPLASMAS \\nMany yellowing diseases of plants were thought to be caused by viruses because \\nof the symptoms and mode of transmission and reproduction of the causative organisms. \\nDoi et al proposed that some yellowing disease could be the result of cell wall less \\nprokaryotes instead of viruses. This idea led to the discovery of pleomorphic, wall free \\nprokaryotic endoparasites residing in the phloem of diseased plants. Cell wall free \\nprokaryotes infecting plants were previously termed as \"Mycoplasma like Organisms\" or \\nII MLOs\" , because of their structural resemblance to mycoplasma. Mycoplasmas cause \\nvarious kinds of disorders in humans and animals and are sensitive to tetracycline and \\npenicillin both, whereas MLOs are sensitive to tetracycline only. In contrast to mycoplasma, \\nthe plant parasitic MLOs cannot be cultured in vitro in cell free media. In the last decade \\nevidences provided by fluorescence and electron microscopy and application of molecular \\ntechniques resolved that MLOs are the mollicutes quite distinct from mycoplasmas. This \\nfinding led to a proposal that the term MLOs be replaced with the generic name of \\nPHYTOPLASMA. \\nPhytoplasmas are the smallest known phloem-limited plant pathogenic unicellular \\nobligate endoparasites. These are bacteria-like prokaryotic organism surrounded by \\nplasma membrane that lack true nucleus and membrane bound organelles. Their mode \\nof multiplication is through binary fission. Phytoplasmas have no characteristic cell wall \\nand have neither been isolated, nor purified, nor cultured on an axenic medium so far. \\nThese are pleomorphic that can stretch and can cross the sieve plates to migrate towards \\nthe roots in autumn and towards the shoot in spring. \\nPhytoplasmas are thought to be evolved from the Gram positive bacteria, they have \\na DNA genome which is A-T rich, some Phytoplasmas have the lowest G-C content (23 \\nto 26.3%) of any living organism. The size of genome of these microbes ranges from 640 \\nto 1185 kb. Phytoplasmas have a long incubation period that can spread as epidemic \\ncausing significant economic damage. Symptoms on infected plants become evident only \\none or two years after infection, when the disease has already spread to other plants. \\nPhytoplasmas are considered to be quarantine organisms in the European Union. \\nTransportation of Phytoplasma infected plants is forbidden even if the specific vector \\nspecies is absent in the importation area.PHYrOPLASMA 271 \\nOccurrence and Maintenance \\nLike mycoplasma, phytoplasmas are organ/ tissue specific. They are found more \\nfrequently in the roots, but can also be found in many places in the plant. Phytoplasmas \\nare obligate endoparasites located inside the cell walls of their hosts, either as extra\\xad\\ncytoplasmic in mature sieve tubes of or as intra-cytoplasmic in young sieve tubes. Since \\nleaf hoppers and plant hoppers are their vectors, therefore, these have been discovered \\nin their body parts also. Phytoplasmas have not yet been grown in vitro on cell free nutrient \\nmedia in the laboratories. All efforts to culture these microorganisms under artificial \\nconditions have been failed. Phytoplasmas are maintained in the host plants. This can \\nbe achieved by tissue culture techniques, by grafting infected twigs on susceptible plants, \\nor by insect transmission. \\nDetection \\nUnlike typical bacteria, phytoplasmas cannot be cultured on artificial media in the \\nlaboratory. However, they can be determined with phytoplasma-specific stains such as \\nDAPI (4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) a nucleic acid stain, which stain bacteria in phloem. \\nDienes\\' stain is metabolized by phytoplasmas that produces blue colour. Healthy phloem \\ndoes not impart colour. Dienes\\' stain is more specific than DAPI. Phytoplasmas are \\ndetected by grafting infected twigs to susceptible host plants such as Periwinkle (Catharallthus \\nroseus). These can also be detected using light or electron microscopy, molecular techniques \\nincluding DNA probes, enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assays (ELISA) and DNA \\namplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). \\nVectors \\nPhytoplasma vector species belong to hemipters that are phloem-feeding insects. \\nThree families Oassidea, Cixidae and Psyllidae) contain the known vector species. It has \\nbeen found that phytoplasmas circulate, multiply and persist in the body of leafhopper \\nvectors. It is considered that phytoplasmas are not transmitted vertically to the progeny \\nof infected specimen. Among plant hoppers, species in the cixiid family are known to \\ntransmit phytoplasma belonging to \"stolbur\" group. Among psyllids, several species have \\nbeen shown to transmit diseases of fruit trees. Leafhoppers, and psyllids are the most \\ncommon vectors of phytoplasma. \\nSpread and Transmission \\nPhytoplasmas are completely dependent on their host for existence, as these as \\nobligate endoparasites. They live in phloem of the plants. Phytoplasmas generally move \\nto a new area by grafting, planting infected cuttings, by parasitic plants such as Dodder \\n(Cuscuta Spp) and by leafhoppers, which migrate annually. Phytoplasmas are phloem\\xad\\nlimited and cannot be transmitted through seeds. It is unlikely that phytoplasmas could \\nsurvive the desiccation usually associated with seed formation. \\nDisease Symptoms \\nSymptoms on plants include virescence (the development of green flowers), phyllody272 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(the development of floral parts into leafy structures), sterility of flowers, proliferation of \\nadventitious or axillary shoots resulting in witches-broom appearance, abnormal elongation \\nof internodes resulting in slender shoots, generalized stunting (eg. small flowers, leaves, \\nshortened internodes), unseasonal discoloration of leaves or shoots (eg. yellowing, purple \\ndiscoloration), leaf curling or cupping, bunchy appearance of growth at the ends of stem, \\nbrownish discoloration of phloem tissues, and generalized decline (stunting, die back of \\ntwigs of trunks, lethal yellowing). \\nDiseases associated with the presence of phytoplasmas in phloem typically exhibit \\nan array of symptoms mentioned above. \\nIdentification \\n(1) Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using polyclonal and monoclonal \\nantiseara; \\n(2) Dot hybridization assay, using cloned phytoplasma DNA and their complementary \\nRNA probes; \\n(3) Southern hybridization assay, by analyzing RELP of part of or total genomic \\nDNA using selected cloned DNA probes, including highly repetitive sequences in the \\ngenome; \\n(4) Polymerase chain rea,ctions (PCR), using primers based on cloned DNA fragments \\nspecific to a given phytoplasma or a subgroup and \\n(5) RELP analysis of DNA sequences with various degrees of conservation, using \\nvarious conserved sequences such as 16s rRNA gene, ribosomal protein, operon, tuf gene \\nand other chromosomal DNA fragments. \\nClassification \\nPhytoplasma diseases were initially classified eiUler on the basis of the symptoms \\n(decline, proliferation and virescence) they develop, or type of plants infected by them, \\nor type of insect vectors (leafhoppers, plant hoppers and psyllids) that transmitted them \\nto the plants. In the previous decade, identification of phytoplasma has been resolved \\nthrough novel techniques of restriction endonuclease digestion of PCR-amplified rDNA \\nproducts, electrophoresis of digests on agarose or polyacrylamide gel, and comparison \\nof resulting fragments with those of known phytoplasmas. In 1993, Lee et al identified \\na total of 16 groups of 16SrDNA on the basis of dissimilarities of restriction sites detected \\nby rDNA RELPs. \\nGarrity et al divided the domain bacteria into 23 phyla of which 13th phylum \\nPirmicutes comprises of three classes (namely Clostridia, Mollicutes and Bacilli). The class\\xad\\nMollicutes, consists of wall less bacteria and has been divided into five orders: the order \\nAcholeplasmatales has a single family Acholeplasmataceae that comprises only two \\ngenera-Acholeplasma and Phytoplasma. \\nDomain: Bacteria (23 phyla) \\nPhylum: Pirmicutes (3 classes)PHYrOPLASMA \\nClass: Mollicutes (4 orders) \\nOrder: Acholeplasmatales (1 family) \\nFamily: Acholeplasmataceae (2 genera) \\nGenus: Phytoplasma \\nPhytoplasma 16SrI \\nPhytoplasma 16SrII \\nPhytoplasma 16SrIII \\nPhytoplasma 16SrIV \\nPhytol\\'lasma 16SrV \\nPhytoplasma 16SrVI \\nPhytoplasma 16SrVII \\nPhytoplasma 16SrVIII \\nPhytoplasma 16SrIX \\nPhytoplasma 16SrX \\nPhytoplasma 16SrXI \\nPhytoplasma 16SrXII \\nPhytoplasma 16SrXIII \\nPhytoplasma 16SrXIV \\nAster yellows group \\nPeanut WB group \\nX-disease group \\nCoconut lethal yellows group \\nElm yellow group \\nClover proliferation group \\nAsh yellows group \\nLoofah witche\\'s-broom group \\nPigeon pea witche\\'s-broom group \\nApple proliferation group \\nRice yellow dwarf group \\nStolbur group \\nMexican Periwinkle virescence group \\nBermuda white leaf group \\nPhytoplasma 16SrXV Hibiscus witche\\'s broom group \\n273 \\nSeemuller et al (1998) described eight more genera which are given below and were \\nnot mentioned in the previous classification AUSGY-Australian Grapevine Yellows.

Phytoplasma infected plants are passed through seed cycle, \\nsince Phytoplasmas are not seed transmitted. Remission of symptoms \\nand curing a plant can be achieved through the application of the antibiotic tetracycline. \\nConventional control methods include sanitary selection, in some cases pruning of \\nbranches of woody plants with localized symptoms, destruction of phytoplasma reservoir \\nplants, monitoring of vector species, thermotherapy, cross protection and genetic selection \\nfor tolerant of resistant varieties. \\nLittle Leaf of Brinjal or Egg Plant \\nLittle leaf of brinjal (Solanum melongena) is found throughout India and other \\nneighbouring countries. This disease was first reported from Coimbatore by Thomas and274 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nKrishnaswami (1939). Almost all brinjal varieties are susceptible to this disease. The \\ndisease is a serious threat for the crop grown. When young plants are attacked they do \\nnot produce flowers and fruits. The disease can cause upto 64% reduction in plant \\nproductivity. The mycoplasma can affect at least 13 plants genera in 5 families include \\ncultivated and wild egg plants, datura, tomato, tobacco etc. \\nSymptoms \\nThe main symptom is production of very short and small leaves. The petioles are \\nso much reduced in size become narrow, soft, smooth and yellowish in colour. Newly \\nformed leaves are further reduced in size. The inter node become shortened and at the \\nsame time large number of axillary buds are stimulated to grow into short branches with \\nsmall leaves. This gives the plant a bushy appearance and plant fail to form flowers and \\neven if flowers are formed they remain green and leaf like. Virescent (a coloured tissue \\nthat develops chloroplast and becomes green), and phylloid flowers (floral coloured parts \\ndevelop chloroplast and become green) is common fruit setting is seldom. \\nVerma et al. (1969) showed that the disease symptoms are associated with MLO\\'s \\n(now phytoplasma). MLB\\'s were described as spherical to ovoid structure (40-300 nm) \\nand were present in the phloem cells of diseased plants. The phytoplasma are also seen \\nin the body organs of vectors. \\nIn nature the causal agent of the disease is transmitted by the leaf hopper vector \\nCestius phycitis and also by Empoasca devastans. Vector acquire MLO\\'s after several days \\nof feeding and transmit MLO\\'s after an incubation period of 10-45 days. The incubation \\nperiod is required for the multiplication and distribution of MLO\\'s in the insect body. \\nDuring the off season of brinjal crop the causal agent survives on weed hosts (Solanum \\nxallthocarpum) and then it is transmitted to the main crop by the insect vectors. Bitter gourd, \\nwater melon, carrot, sunhemp are good hosts of the vector and beet, castor, soybean are \\nsuitable for oviposition. \\nControl \\nNo effective control measures against the pathogen is known. Antibiotic treatment \\nwith tetracycline is reported to control the disease eradication of weed hosts and diseased \\nbrinjal plants and control of insect vectors by insecticide is the only recommendations \\nin India. The Indian variety Brinjal round is tolerant. \\n000GENERAL ACCOUNT OF CYANOBACTERIA \\nThe two divisions of algae contain prokaryotic algae which are now usually called \\nbacteria in view of their cell structure being very similar to eubacteria. Thus cyanophyta \\n(= Cyanophyceae) are called cyanobacteria and Prochlorophyta (= Prochlorophyceae) \\nare termed Prochlorobacteria. \\nThe Division - Cyanophyta (Cyanobacteria) are the blue greens, the most primitive \\nof algal organisms. They have existed on the surface of the earth since the early \\nPrecambrian. Blue green algae are kept under the class myxophycae or cyanophyceae of \\nthe algae division. They are commonly called as blue-green algae due to the presence \\nof water soluble accessory photosynthetic pigments named C-phycocyanin and C\\xad\\nphycoerythrin which impart blue-green colour to the algae. Along with this certain \\ncharacteristics Xanthophylls viz myxoxanthin, and myxoxanthophyll, oscillaxanthin, \\nzeaxanthin are present in addition to chlorophyll -a and 13 - carotene etc. Fritsch (1945) \\nclassified the blue green algae into class myxophycae. He also called this algae as the \\nmembers of class schizophyceae (Schizo = fission) and phycochromophyceae. An eminent \\nIndian phycologist Prof. T.V. Desikachari (1959), Morris (1973) and Round (1973) kept \\nthis algae in Division Cyanophyta but Chapman (1962) gave them a separate name \\nMyxophycophyta. But according to recent trend these members are kept under the \\nmembers of prokaryota and called as cyanobacteria. \\nGENERAL CHARACfERS OF CYANOBACTERIA \\n(1) They have a prokaryotic cell organisation. \\n(2) They lack the membrane bound cell organelles such as chloroplast, mitochondria, \\nE.R., nucleus. They lack definite chromosome however DNA fibrils are present. \\n(3) Photosynthetic pigments include chlorophyll-a, 13- carotene, xanthophylls276 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(lutein and zeaxanthin) and biliproteins (C-phycocyanin and phycoerythrin). \\nNo distinct plastid, the photosynthetic pigments are located on photosynthetic \\nlamellae (thylakoid) generally scattered in the peripheral protoplast. \\n(4) Thallus bears a specialized gliding movement. \\n(5) Reserve food material is cyanophycean starch and cyanophycean granules. \\n(6) According to Fischer (1897) the cytoplasm of cell is divided into two parts \\nthe outer or peripheral chromoplasm and the central colourless centroplasm. \\n(7) Many members of class cyanophyta are involved in nitrogen fixation viz. \\nNostoc, Anabaena, Calotlzrix and Cylindrospermum. \\n(8) All the members of this class screate mucilage and usually possess a mucilage \\nsheath. This muciliage may be yellow, brown, red or purple in colour. \\n(9) Many floating and planktonic algae member of this class bears gas vacuole. \\nFor example in Nostac, Calothrix, Phormidium etc. The gas vacuole provide \\nbuyoancy to the floating algae. \\n(10) Vegetative reproduction is by means of hormogonia, endospore, and nanocytes \\nlike structure. \\n(11) No asexual reproduction is reported. \\n(12) No sexual reproduction.

Majority of genera are found \\nboth in fresh as well as in brackish (saltish) water. \\nHigh temperature, intense light and humid environment is required for the growth \\nof thallus. According to Desikachari (1959) about 160 genera and 1500 species are \\nreporated from the tropical areas. In India the members are represented by 85 genera \\nand 750 species. The members of blue green algae are found in hot and humid \\nenvironment, moist or alkaline land, along with this they require high intensity of light. \\nThe members of blue green algae grow extensively in the paddy fields of tropical and \\ntemperate climate region eg-Anabaena, Nostoc, Tolypothrix, and Cylindrospermum grow \\nactivily and fix atmospheric nitrogen. \\nSome members of cyanobacteria are found in fresh water lakes, ponds and various \\ntypes of water reservoirs. Many members grow extensively on the surface of fresh water \\nand form water blooms. eg-MicrOCljstis and Arthospira. Such algae growth emit bad odour \\nand render water obnoxious and undrinkable. \\nSome blue green algae when abundant, may also impart their colour to water. For \\nego Trichodesmium erythraeum is responsible for red colour of the red sea. The red colour \\nis due to the presence of red pigments in the cell, and the extensive growth of this \\nalgae impart the expression of red coloured water of the sea.GENERAL ACCOUNT OF CYANOBACTERIA 277 \\nSome blue green algae live symbiotically with different organisms, ex- Anabaena \\nand Nostoc in Anthoceros (Bryophyta) thallus and Anabaena in Cycas (corolloid) root.

Filamentous \\nforms may be unbranched or branched, heterotrichous or even pseudo parenchymatous. \\nArchitecturally the thallus may be a solitary cell or a colony. \\n(1) Unicellular: The thallus is a unicell which may be spherical or oval eg\\xad\\nChroococcus, Synechococcus and Gloeocapsa. Actual unicellular forms however are not many \\nbecause the copious secretion of mucilage by the daughter cells results in the daughter \\ncells, remaining together after division. \\n(2) Colonial forms: In cyanobacteria the cells after division remain attached by \\ntheir walls or are held in a common gelatinous matrix to form a loose organisation \\nof cells which is termed as a colony. The colony is of two types: \\n(a) Palmelloid: The thallus structure resembles the algae Palmella eg- Microcystis \\nand Gleocapsa. \\n(b) Dendroid: The thallus is found in Chamaesiphon. \\n(3) Filamentous: The cells are arranged end to end in a row which is a result of \\nrepeated cell divisions in a single plane and in a single direction forming a chain or \\na thread. It is known as the trichome. The trichome together with its mucilaginous sheath \\nis called a filament. In most cases a single filament has a single trichome, but in some \\ncases more than one trichome may occur within the common sheath. The cells of trichome \\nmay show little or no differentiation into base and apex ex. : Oscillatoria or it may have \\na broad base while its apex tapers to a hair like structure. Ex- Rivularia.278 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe trichomes of some members are \\'homocystous\\' i.e. made up of uniform cells \\ne.g. Oscillatoria but trichomes of majority of algae are \\'heterocystous\\' i.e. it contain some \\nspecial cells called \\'heterocyst\\' at one or both ends or at regular intervals along their \\nlength ego Rivularia. \\nTrichomes may be branched or unbranched: \\n(a) Unbranched: Trichomes are unbranched (simple) in some members (e.g. \\nAnabaena, Nostoc, Oscillatoria) simple trichomes may be either free floating (e.g. Spirulina) \\nor aggregated into colonies (eg. Anabaena and Nostoc). Some time unbranched trichomes \\nshow false branching (eg. Scytonema). A cell of a trichome dies and one or both ends \\nof the trichome at the point of the dead cell grow out as false branches. \\n(b) Branched: Trichome are of the following three types:-\\nMicrocystis Aphanocapsa \\n(8) \\n\\'.; .. ::: .... -:i--------I!~~:~ \\':.\\':.:~~ .. \\'\\\\ \\nfif.Ji::~;·;!ti \\'::::\\' : .. i! \\n:IIIQ~:. ~.\" I: \\'. \". \\'.:;, (\\\\Zjl \". .: I ,I ... ,: \\'>\"\\'____.

Siphonaceous \\nand true parenchymatous forms are lacking in cyanophyta. \\nCELL STRUcrURE \\nFollowing structures are found in a prokaryotic cyanophyceae cell. \\n(1) Sheath: Cell in some species possess an external diffluent delicate mucilaginous \\nsheath. The sheath is usually thick and slimy but in a few forms such as Allacystis montana \\nit is extremely delicate. The secretion of copious mucilage is an important characteristics \\nof the blue green algae and earned for them the name myxophyceae which means slime \\nalgae. Sheath serves to hold the cell colonies together. The sheath may become lamellated \\nor stratified and sometimes pigmented. In the later case it is usually yellowish or \\nbrownish in colour. Usually it is colourless. The slimy nature of the sheath endows the \\ncell with great water absorbing and water retaining capacity favouring its survival under \\nconditions of dessication. \\n(2) Cell wall: Cell possess a distinct cell wall which is relatively thick and two \\nlayered i.e. outer and inner layers. The members of order stigonematales bear well \\ndeveloped pit connections between the cells.280 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nCell wall is found between the mucilagenous sheath and cell membrane. Pectin \\nis found in the form of Calcium and Magnesium pectate. According to Carr and Whilton \\n(1973) cell wall is a tough and complex structure and divided into four layers viz. LI, \\nLII, LIII and LIV respectively. The outer layer bears cellulose, hemi-cellulose, muramic \\nacid and amino acids while the inner membrane had alanine, glucosamine, glutamic \\nacid and dipicholinic acid. The longitudinal wall of Oscillatoria bears pores. Some \\nendosymbionts viz. Cyanophora and GlalLcocystis lacks cell wall and contain plasma \\nmembrane made up of lipoprotein. \\n(3) Protoplast: The protoplast of cyanophyta is a less differentiated structure as \\nit lacks an organized nucleus with distinct surrounding membrane, endoplasmic \\nreticulum, membrane bound plastids, mitchondria, golgi apparatus, and sap vacuole. \\nCytoplasm undergoes no cyclosis and streaming movements. Under light microscope \\nthe cytoplasm appears to be divided into two region: a centrally located clear area \\nsurrounded by a denser portion. The former is called centroplasm and the latter \\nchromo plasm. The two regions are not separated from each other by any membrane \\nor other structure. \\n(i) Chromoplasm: This is the outer pigmented zone of the cell protoplast. The \\nstructure of chromo plasm is considered homogenous, finely alveolar, or reticular \\nstructure. The chromplasm contains a considerable amount of imbibed water and sticks \\nto the wall. The osmotic pressm~ of the cell is low. Chromoplasm contains a number \\nof non-living inclusions in the form of small, spherical or irregularly shaped granules. \\nMajority of them are the nature of reserve food materials which may be of proteinaceous \\nor carbohydrate nature. The carbohydrate are stored in the form of a unique kind of \\nstarch known as cyanophycian starch. The proteinaceous granules are named the \\ncyanophycean granules. In some species oil droplets as well as lipids occur in the \\nchromoplasm. \\nSome planktonic species such as Anabaena and Polycystis the chromoplasm contains \\nclusters of gas or pseudovacuoles. These are gas containing cavities within the protoplast. \\nThe walls of these vacuoles are freely permeable to the common gas. The gas filled \\npseudo-vacuoles make the algae thallus buoyant and thus rise to the surface of water. \\nThe pseudo vacuoles provide a buoyancy-regulating mechanism enabling the planktonic \\nspecie~ to poise at particular depth. \\nThe pigments under light microscope appear to be in solution in the chromoplasm. \\nThe pigments are chI-a, ~-carotene, xanthophylls and phycobilins. Phycobilins are blue \\nC-phycbcyanin and red C-phycoerythrin. Xanthophyll are zeaxanthin, myxoxanthophyll, \\nmyxoxanthin and oscilloxanthin. The phycobilins are water soluble whereas the chlorophyll \\nand carotenoid are fat soluble. \\nThis accounts for the many hues in the chromo plasm from dark-green to blue green, \\nolive green, grey-green, yellow, brown, purpled orange or red in some blue green algae \\nsuch as ChroococcllS turgidus. \\n(ii) Centroplasm: It forms the central area of the protoplast of a cyanophyte cells. \\nIt forms about 1/4 to 1/2 the volume of the cell and consist of a relatively dense massGENERAL ACCOUNT OF CYANOBACTERIA 281 \\nof material which is considered nuclear in nature. The nuclear material is arranged in \\na loose reticulum and includes fibrils in which DNA and RNA are present. In modern \\nterminology genophore is the name suggested for such a primitive nucleus. The division \\nis amitotic. \\nStarch granUle \\nCell wall \\nPyrenoid \\nre \\nFig. 2 : Cell structure \\nPHOTOSYNTHETIC PIGMENTS AND CHROMATIC ADAPTATION \\nEmbedded in the cytoplasm within the plasma membrane are elongate flattened \\nsacs named the lamellae or thylakoids. They are not seen under light microscope. The \\nlamellae tend to be concentrated and organized in parallel arrays near the periphery \\nof the protoplast. EM show that the thylakoid contain pigments and thus constitute the \\nphotosynthetic apparatus of the cyanophyte cells. Each thylakoid is bounded by two \\nunit membranes with a small flattened area in between. The thylakoid bears the \\nphotosynthetic pigment like chI-a, p-carotene and lipid globules. Phycobilisomes particles \\nare present on the surface of thylakoid. The particles contain the water soluble pigment \\nC-phycocyanin and C-phycoerythrin. Bisalputra et al. (1969) suggest that the photo \\nsynthetic lamellae provides the sites for cellular respiration also and hence should be \\ntermed as photosynthetic respiratory membrane. These membrane can change their \\npositions under certain conditions unlike other algae. In some blue green algae the visual \\ncolour of thallus depends upon the quality and type of light. For example in the presence \\nof red light the thallus of Oscillatoria appears green in colour while in yellow light it282 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nappears blue and green in the presence of red light. Thus this quality of thallus to change \\nits colour according to the colour of light it receives is called as complementary chromatic \\nadaptation or the Goidukov phenomenon called after the name of its russian discoverer, \\nGoidukov (1902, 1906 to 1923). This chromatic adaptation helps the algae to maximum \\nutilize the available light for photosynthesis. \\n(5) Nucleoid: It is found in the centroplasm portion of the cell. The DNA fibres \\nare spreaded irregularly in the nucleoid. The fibres lack histones and protamines. The \\ngenome is 2nm in width and 1.6 x 109 dalton in its molecular weight. According to \\nHerdman (1974) the genome of cyanobacteria varies from 1.2 x 109 to 7.4 X 109. It means \\nthat about 2 to 6 replicas can be made of this genome. \\n(6) Other Cell Inclusion: Irrespective of the above structures the cyanophycean \\ncell contain other cell inclusion like cyanophycean granules, polyhedral RNA containing \\nstructure polyphosphate structures, alpha and beta particles. 70S ribosomes etc. Along \\nwith this polyglucoside granules are attached with the thylakoids. According to Lang \\n(1972) these are combined forms of glycogen particles and polyphosphate structures \\nalong with this gas vacuoles or pseudovacuoles are also found. \\n(I) Gas Vacuoles or Pseudovacuoles \\nRecent observations have shown that the gas vacuoles or pseudo-vacuoles common \\nin planktonic Oscillatoria and Anabaena species are of irregular shape and consist of \\ncylindrical vesicles with conical ends stacked in arrays. These vesicles are bound by \\nsingle membrane. The membrane is permeable to common gases. Fogg (1972) has shown \\nthat the gas-vacuoles are more commonly \\nproduced under low intensity of light and \\nthen suddenly collapse under high intensity \\nof light. This results due to increased rate of \\nphotosynthesis which produces more quantity \\nof sugar and increases the osmotic pressure \\nso that there is a quick collapse of the gas- Cell wall \\nvacuoles at the surface level of water in the Plasmalemma \\nplanktonic species. After collapse the filaments \\nsink down at the bottom of water-reservoir. \\nThus gas vacuoles have a great ecological \\nimportance and serve to regulate the \\nbuoyancy of the planktonic forms. According \\nto Pringsheim (1966) the gas vacuoles are \\nproduced under anaerobic conditions in \\nOscillatoria agardltii. \\n(II) Heterocyst \\nCertain members of the genera \\nNostocales and Stigonematales (which include \\nfilamentous forms) except Oscillatoriales \\nproduce enlarged, thick walled, pale yellowish \\nspecialized cells in addition to the vegetative Fig. 3 : Ultrastructure of heterocystGENERAL ACCOUNT OF CYANOBACTERIA 283 \\ncells. These large empty looking specialized cells are called the heterocysts. The \\nheterocysts are peculiar in blue green algae. They may be terminal or intercalary in \\nposition in filamentous algae. \\nThe heterocyst develops from an ordinary vegetative cell particularly the recently \\ndivided one usually one of the daughter cell called the proheterocyst develops into a \\nheterocyst and the other into a vegetative cell. The contents become uniform and pale \\nin colour. The end walls become rounded. The other changes takes places are : \\n(i) Secretion of an inner non cellulose polysaccharide wall layer external to the \\noriginal cell membrane. \\n(ii) Formation of pore either at one or both poles of the new wall layer. \\n(iii) Establishment of protoplasmic connections with the neighbouring vegetative \\ncells through the polar pores. \\n(iv) Filling of polar pores towards maturity by mucilage which looks like shinning \\nnodules under the microscope. \\n(v) The cell contents become homogenous with chemical changes in the nucleic \\nacids. \\n(vi) Gradual loss of photosynthetic pigments except carotelloids. \\n(vii) Recent studies using electron microscope reveal that the process of transformation \\nof a vegetative cell into a heterocyst involves gradual enlargement of the entire \\ncell and cell wall becomes many layered. The photosynthetic lamellae become \\nreoriented and form a complex reticulation. \\nPHYSIOLOGY AND NATURE OF HETEROCYST \\n(i) Fritsch (1951) called the heterocyst of cyanophyta as \\'a botanical enigma\\'. \\n(ii) According to Geitler et al \"the heterocyst are archaic reproductive cells, now \\nlargely functionless but at time still fulfilling their old role. \\n(iii) Wolk (1966) & Fay et al (1968) says heterocyst playa role in sporulation. This \\nfound support from the fact that the vegetative cell near the heterocyst \\nsporulate earlier and that heterocyst is removed, there is no sporulation in \\nAnabaena cycadeae. \\n(iv) During 1969 evidence suggested that the heterocyst provide the site for the \\nfixation of atmospheric nitrogen since the enzyme nitrogenase essential in the \\nprocess of nitrogen fixation is found to be present only in heterocysts and not \\nin vegetative cell. \\n(v) Stewart (1972) believe that all nitrogen fixing blue green algae are heterocystous. \\nAll these condition sufficiently prove that the heterougst are solely meant for the \\nfixation of elementary nitrogen. \\nAccording to Fogg following factors control the production of heterocyst: \\n(i) Heterocyst formation increases under conditions of low light intensities. Blue \\ngreen light inhibit while red light promote heterocyst formation.284 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(ii) The increase in the amount of phosphate in the medium leads to increase in \\nheterocyst production. \\n(iii) The concentration of nitrogen in the medium above a certain level results in \\ncomplete inhibition of heterocyst production. \\nFUNCTIONS OF HETEROCYST \\nVarious function suggested by different workers are:-\\n(i) They are considered as a weak link of the filament or tricho·me. Thus trichome \\nbreaks down from the heterocyst portion and help in the vegetative reproduction \\nor in hormogonia formation. \\n(ii) Heterocyst also helps in the formation of endospore. For example in Nostoc \\nCOllll1lUne and Anabaena cycadacearum heterocyst helps in asexual reproduction. \\n(iii) Some consider them to be the store houses of reserve food materials. \\n(iv) In Nostoc commune and Gloetrichia raciborski they act as vestigial spores, which \\ngerminate and form new trichome on germination. \\n(v) R.N. Singh (1961) and Fogg (1974) declared that the heterocysts are the site \\nof nitrogen fixation in filamentous algae. \\n(vi) According to Serpette (1948) heterocyst provide strength to the thallus. \\n(vii) They promote the formation of akinete in the thallus. \\n(viii) They are the site of oxyrespiration. \\n(ix) In Calotlm·x weberi heterocyst act as a secondary reproductive structure. \\n(x) According to Cannabacus (1929) there is a very close relationship between \\nthe heterocyst and gas vacuole formation. \\nNUTRITION IN CYANOBACTERIA \\nThe cyanobacteria in general are obligate photoautotrophs because they can\\'t grow \\nin darkness even in the presence of organic nutrients in the substrate. The reserve food \\nmaterial is stored in the form of cyanophycean starch (a product of photosynthesis). \\nSimon (1971) suggest that these cyanophycean starch granules are made up of \\npolypeptide which contains only two amino acids viz. Arginine and Aspartic acid. \\nThe capacity of cyanobacteria to assimilate and metabolise exogenous organic \\ncompound is very limited and they can\\'t use organic compounds as a source of energy. \\nMovements: Despite the fact that blue green algae lack flagellated motile cells yet \\nsome genera like Oscillatoria, Spirulina and other show creeping or gliding movement \\nin longitudinal direction of the longitudinal axis of a filament when in contact with \\na solid or semi-solid substrate. The movement is also accompanied by a clockwise or \\nanti clock wise rotation of a trichome and is specific for a species. The filaments are \\nusually in contact with a solid or semisolid substratum and their free ends show a slow \\nor jerky but pendulum like oscillations. In Oscillatoriaceae the velocity of movement \\nis usually well over 2 ~m sec-I and ranges up to 11 ~m sec-I. The path covered by filament \\nis not straight but a curved one.GENERAL ACCOUNT OF CYANOBACTERIA 285 \\nReproduction \\nThe cyanobacteria reproduce by simple and primitive methods of reproduction \\nwhich are vegetative and asexual. Sexual reproduction is absent however genetic \\nrecombination has been reported by Kumar (1962) and Bazin (1968). Shestakov and \\nKhyen (1970) have reported genetic recombination in Allacystis ridulalls. \\nVegetative Reproduction \\nIt is generally by fission, fragmentation and by the formation of hormogonia. \\n(i) Fission: The unicellular cyanophyceae (ex. SYllecllOcystis) reproduce by this \\nmethod called binary fission. This is the chief method of multiplication in the unicellular \\nforms. The nuclear division (either by amitosis or mitosis) precedes the cell division. \\nThis is followed by cytokinesis. Under E.M. the cytokinesis reveals in filamentous algae \\nas the involution of plasma membrane. This involution latter grows inward in the middle \\nof the cell forming a_ cross plate between the two halves of the nuclear material. This \\ndivides the protoplast into two equal halves. With the centripetal growth of the cell \\nmembrane a ring-like septum arises from the inner layer of the cell wall and gradually \\ngrows inwards like a diphram with a decreasing aperture splitting the cross plate into \\ntwo layers. Each daughter protoplast comes to possess a continuous plasma membrane. \\nThe completed septum or cross wall then thickens and finally divides into two layers, \\nthe ends of which are continuous with the inner layer of the parent cell wall. A \\nconstriction appears at the surface of the cross wall of the dividing cell exposing the \\nfission between the daughter cells externally. As the daughter cells grows they set up \\nthe turgar pressure which pulls on their walls at the region of contact. The separation \\nof daughter cells thus start at the periphery which proceeds towards the axis of the \\ndividing cell gradually separating the two-daughter cells functioning as independent \\nindividuals. \\n(2) Fragmentation: This plays an important role in non-filamentous and filamentous \\ncolonies. Reaching a certain size, the colony breaks up into small parts. Each part/ \\nfragment is the beginning of a new colony which increases in size by repeated cell \\ndivision. \\nThe fragmentation may also occur by mechanical means. It may result from the \\nbites of the animals feeding on trichomes or stress caused by water currents or death \\nof certain cells. \\n(3) Hormogonia: The trichomes of filamentous genera breaks up within the \\ngelatinous sheath into short sections or segments of one-many uniform living cells. These \\nshort length cells of trichome are called hormogonia or hormogones. The hormogones \\nare delimited either by the formation of heterocyst or by the development of bi-concave \\nseparation disc or necridia (dead cell). \\nIn genera with terminal or no heterocysts the hormogonia are delimited by the \\nformation from time to time of bi-concave, gelatinous separation discs (necridia) between \\nsome of the cells of the trichome. A living cell here and there in the trichome undergo \\nlysis. Its protoplast breaks down to form viscous substance. The mucilage filled dead286 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\ncells are called necridia. The necridium loses turgidity with the result that the mutual \\npressure on the walls of the adjacent cells is released. They bulge out and becomes \\nconvex. These biconcave dead cells are also called the biconcave separation discs because \\nthese provide weak links and thus serve to break the trichome into hormogones. The \\nhormogones may be 2-3 cells or several cells long. \\n(a) 8p m l \\n(d) \\nEndospore in \\nDermocarpa \\n(b) (a-b) Fonnation of honnogonia (~( \\nin oscillatoria Endospore ill Chamaesiphon \\nFig. 4 : Member of Cyanophyceae showing different method \\nof vegetative reproduction \\nAsexual Reproduction \\nThe member of cyanophyceae reproduce by the formation of non-motile, asexual \\nspores which are of various sorts. \\n(1) Akinetes: These are thick walled \\'resistant resting\\' cells which are frequently \\ndeveloped singly next to a heterocyst. These spore like structure contain the entire \\nprotoplast of the cell and have the original parent cell wall as tile outer portion of the \\nspore wall. \\nSeenayya and Suba Raju (1970) observed that phosphorous deficiency of water \\nresulted in increased production of akinete bearing trichomes in Annbaenopsis raciborskii. \\nThese akinetes are modified ordinary vegetative cells. Cell increase in size and \\naccumulates food reserves. They are yellow brown i.n colour cell wall is highly resistant \\nand is often differentiated i.nto two layers. \\nWith the onset of conditions (favourable) akinetes absorb moisture, the thick, \\nresistant wall softens and the protoplast awakens to activity. Prior to emergence through \\nthe end of the softened or ruptured akinete wall the protoplast may undergo many \\ntransverse divisions or it may not undergo the first transverse division and protrudes \\nout of the ruptured wall. The germling (the filamentous forms) behaves like a \\nhormogonium. \\nAkinete formation: The initial step is the cell enlargement which is the first step \\ntowards differentiation of vegetative cell into akinete. This is followed by condensation \\nof the mucilaginous sheath and formation of a dense fibrillar layer over the cell surface. \\nSimultaneously there is deposition of several additional spore wall layers between the \\nfibrillar layer and inner investment and of cyanophycean granules in the periphery of \\nthe cytoplasm. The mature akinete retains cyanophycean and also the thylakoid, \\npolyhedral bodies, lipid deposits and nucleoplasm regions.GENERAL ACCOUNT OF CYANOBACTERIA 287 \\nAkinetes \\n(b) Anabaena \\nFig. 5 : Cyanophyceae-Distribution of Akinctes \\n(2) Endospores: These are small spores formed endogenously within a vegetative \\ncell of the unicellular or cushioned forms of chamaesiphonales which do not form \\nhormogonia. At the time of endospore formation the vegetative cell increases in size. \\nThe protoplast divides by the method of successive bipartition. A large number of small, \\nuninucleated daughter protoplasts are formed. Each daughter protoplast secretes a wall \\naround it to become an endospore. The endospore wall is secreted on liberation. The \\nspore wall is quiet distinct from the wall of parent cell. The liberated endospore \\ngerminates immediately without a resting period. ego Dermocarpa pacifica. \\n(3) Exospores: In Chamaesiphon the cell wall ruptures at the distal end of the \\nvegetative cell. The spores are successively pinched off at the exposed end of the \\nextruded protoplast. They are called exospores. Each exospore is surrounded by a \\ndelicate membrane. \\n(4) Nannocytes: Some non-filamentous blue-green algae such as Microcystis the cell \\ncontent divide repeatedly without any cell enlargement. The successive division follow \\nclosely one upon the other. Numerous daughter cells are produced in each parent cell. \\nThese are called nannocytes. These nannocytes are naked protoplast. They are extremely \\nsmall in size, closely packed which germinate in situ to give rise to new typical colonies. \\n(5) Hormospores or Hormocyst: Some members like Wiestiella produces a thick \\nwalled cells in the hormogonia segment. These structures are known as hormospores \\nwhich on germination give rise to new thallus.288 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nI Endospores \\n8 c \\no \\nFig. 6 : Cyanobacteria showing various types of spores. \\n(a) & (b) Endospores (c) Exospores (d) Hormospores \\nSexual Reproduction or Genetic Recombination \\nTrue sexual reproduction is totally absent in cyanophyceae. Kumar (1962) reported \\na type of genetic recombination in the member AnaClJstis nidulans. It is a type of \\nparasexuality. It is also found in Anabaena and Cylindrospermum. There is a transfer of \\ngenetic material between two mating cells. The transfer process is slow in comparison \\nto the bacteria. \\nClolssification: According to G. Smith, the cyanophyceae is divided into three main \\norders which differ from one another in their vegetative structure and methods of \\nreproduction. These three orders are : \\n(i) Chroococcales \\nIncludes unicellular fresh water \\nor united to form non \\nfilamentous colonies. \\nCovered with mucilage, \\nReproduction by cell division \\nor fragmentation.

They include several physiologically and \\nmorphologically distinctive photosynthesizing bacteria, such as those included in the \\nphyla cyanobacteria, chlorobi (green sulphur bacteria) and chloroflexi (green nonsulphur \\nbacteria). The cyanobacteria produce oxygen during photosynthesis, and the green sulphur \\nand green non-sulphur bacteria do not produce oxygen. \\nThe gram-negative eubacteria include a number of species that are obligately \\nanaerobic. The gram-negative fermentative bacteria are capable of fermenting a wide range \\nof sugars, amino acids and other organic acids, some are capable of fumarate or nitrate\\xad\\nlinked respiration.

The individual fibrils that compose the axial filament \\noriginate near the ends of the cell and are normally more than half the length of the cell. \\nSpirochetes have a typical gram-negative cell wall and a well developed periplasmic space \\nthat encloses the flagella called endoflagella (axial filament). Endoflagella are constrained \\nsomewhat like limbs in a sleeping bag, their flexing propels the cell by rotation and even \\ncrawling motions. \\nThe fibrils of the axial filament have a fine structure essentially the same as that \\nof flagella; a basal body containing a series of disks; a hook; and the filament itself. The \\nnumber of disks varies among the spirochetes: Leptospira typically has two pairs of disks, \\nwhereas most other spirochetes have a single pair of disks. The filaments are often \\nenveloped in a proteinaceous sheath unlike the eubacterial flagellum which, if sheathed, \\nis surrounded by an extension of the outer membrane. The close structural and chemical \\nresemblance between the axial fibril and the flagellum, as well as their similar role in \\nmotility, suggests that they are homologous organelles. The term endoflagella and \\nperiplasmic flagella have accordingly been proposed to describe axial fibrils. \\nThe spirochetes are classified in the order spirochaetales which contain two families \\nand five ganera. The majority of spirochetes are free living saprobes or commensals of \\nanimals and are not primary pathogens. But three genera that contain major human \\npathogens are Treponema, Leptospira and Borrelia. \\nm~~--- Axial filament \\n.......... 1000-_ Cell wall \\nCell membrane \\n\"-?-H--Cytoplasm \\nFig. 1 : Ultrastructure of Spirochetes292 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMovement in Spirochetes \\nSpirochetes are all very actively motile, exhibiting a variety of translational and non \\ntranslational movements. Among the latter are twisting, lashing and writhing movements \\nthat are characteristic of the group. Since these movements are very rapid and since the \\ncells are often so thin as to be at the edge of detection with the light microscope, they \\nlook as if they were instantaneously moving from one position to another. On surfaces, \\nspirochetes can glide, a motility often termed creeping rather than gliding. They also \\nexhibit an \\'inchworm\\' kind of motility, in which one end of the cell attaches to the surface, \\nand the other end attaches nearby: the first end then detaches and reattaches at a distance. \\nRepitition of these steps results in relatively rapid movement. \\nThe axial filament has long been suspected to playa role in motility, suspicion that \\nwas strengthened when the structural resemblance between their constituent fibers and \\nbacterial flagella was recognized. The isolation of immotile mutants with altered axial \\nfibrils confirms the role of endoflegella in motility. \\nNevertheless, it is still unclear how motion is actually effected. Because of the \\nstructural homology between flagella and endoflagella, it is tempting to propose that they \\nshere a similar mechanism, namely rotation from the base of the filament. How endoflagellar \\nrotation would result in cell movement is controversial. However it is clearly not due to \\nrotation of the cell as a whole; rather a helical wave is propagated down the cell. Two \\nfundamental mechanisms are envisaged-rotation of flexible endoflagella may cause the \\nrigid helical murein-bound protoplast to rotate within the outer membrane or rotation of \\nthe rigid helical endoflagella may cause the liable cell body to flex in the form of a helical \\nwave. \\nS.No. \\n1. \\n2. \\n3. \\n4. \\n5. \\nFig. 2 : Movement in spirochete \\nTABLE 1 \\nCharacteristic Features of Spirochetes in Pure Culture \\nCharacters Trepollema Borrelia Leptospira \\nCell diameter 0.1-0.4 llm 0.2-0.5 llm 0.1 llm \\nRelationship to 02 Anaerobe Microaerophile Aerobe \\nEnergy metabolism Fermentative Fermentative Respiratory \\nPercent G + C 22-54 Unknown 35-52 \\nCarbon and energy Sugars or Sugars Fatty acid \\nsource Amino acids or fatty alcohols \\nContd ...GRAM -ve BACTERIA 293 \\n...

One of the first \\ndetectable steps in division is the appearance of a new set of endoflagella originating \\nat the middle of the cell. A septum then is laid down between the basal bodies, and the \\ntwo daughter cells separate. However, such coupling between cell division and cell \\nseparation is not universal, there are strains of spirochaeta that are multicellular filaments \\nup to 250 ~m long.294 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nDiversity of Spirochetes \\nLipids are a major part of the spirochetes cell mass. All but leptospires contain \\nmonogalactosyl-diglyceride as one of their polar lipids; Borrelia also contains cholesterol. \\nThe envelope of many spirochetes contains substantial amounts of. polysaccharide of \\nvarying composition. The presence of 3-0- methylmannose in this carbohydrate fraction \\nis characteristic of Leptospira. \\nSpirochetes are free living and characteristically inhabit anaerobic or microaerobic \\nsediments. They have a high sulfide tolerance, important in sediments that support active \\nsulphur reduction. They ferment carbohydrates via the Embden-Meyer hoff pathway to \\npyruvate, which is cleaned by a clostridial-type classic reaction to acetyl Co-A. Fermentation \\nproducts are ethanol, acetate, CO 2 and H2 \\nTreponema includes a number of parasitic but not pathogenic anaerobes. They \\ninclude both amino acid-fermenting and carbohydrate fermenting strains produce acetate \\nand butyrate as major products, sometimes accompanied by varying amounts of succinate \\nor lactate, and ethanol and butanol. The amino acid fermenting strains produce principally \\nacetate, with varying amounts of propionate, butyrate or lactate. \\nThe Leptospires are the only obligately aerobic spirochetes. They require fatty acids \\nnot only as precursors of membrane lipids, but also as their respiratory substrate, they \\ncannot respire carbohydrates or other compounds. They have a characteristic morphology, \\nthe posterior end of swimming cells is always hooked, while the anterior end is straight \\nor helical, immobile cells may be hooked at both ends. \\nSymbiosis with Invertebrate Animals \\nThe hindgut of termites and wood-eating roaches is a fermentation chamber in \\nwhich ingested cellulose is fermented by the microbial inhabitants. The microbial flora \\nof many of these insects is characterized by flagellate protozoa and by large spirochetes, \\nmany of which are attached to the surface of the protozoa. Several genera have been \\nproposed for these spirochetes; their collective name is pillotinas after the generic name \\nof one of them. In some cases it is clear that the attached pillotinas provide motility for \\nthe host protozoan; the flagella steer, while the propulsive force is due to coordinated \\nswimming motions by the spirochetes.

Rarely, syphilis has \\nbeen acquired by transfusion of infected fresh human blood. \\nPrimary Syphilis: The earliest indication of syphilis infectioll is the appearance of \\na hard canker at the site of inoculation, after an incubation period that varies from nine \\ndays to three months. The canker begins as a small, red, hard, bumps that enlarges and \\nbreaks down, leaving a shallow crater with firm margins. The base of the ulcers beneath \\nthe encrusted surface swarms with spirochetes. The cankers heals spontaneously without \\nscarring in three to six weeks, but this healing is deceptive, because \\nthe spirochete has escaped into the circulation and is entering a period tremendous \\nactivity. \\nSecondary Syphilis: About 3-6 months after the canker (an injurious sore) heals, \\nthe secondary stage appears. By then, many systems of the body have been invaded and \\nthe symptoms are more profuse and intense. Initially there is fever, headache and sore \\nthroat, followed by lymphadenopathy and a peculiar red or brown rash that breaks out \\non all skin surfaces, including the palms and the soles. The major complications develop \\nin the bones, hair follicles, joints, liver, eyes, brain and kidneys. \\nBorrelia \\n[Relapsing Fevers] \\nEpidemic or tick borne relapsing fever is caused by several Borrelia sp. Including \\nB. duttoni, B. hermsii B. parkeri and B. turicatae, and is transmitted to huma~ by soft bodied \\nornithodorus ticks. The natural hosts for these organisms include rodents and other small \\nmammals on which the ticks normally feed. \\nEpidemic or louse-borne relapsing fever is caused by B. recurrentis, an obligate \\nhuman pathogen transmitted from person to person by the body louse, Pediculus humanus. \\nThe spirochetes causing the two forms of relapsing fever differ in their mode of \\ngrowth in the arthropod vector, and this influence the way human infection is initiated. \\nB. recurrentis grows in the haemolymph of the louse but does not invade tissues. \\nAs a result the excrement of the louse is non-infectious and the bacterium is not transferred \\ntransovarially to the progeny. Human infection occurs when bacteria released from \\ncrushed lice gain entry to tissues through damaged or intact skin or mucous membranes. \\nTransovarial transmission to the tick progeny maintains the spirochete in the tick \\npopulation. \\nIn both forms of relapSing fever, acute symptoms, including high fever, rigors, \\nheadache, myalgia, arthralgia, photophobia and cough, develop about one week after \\ninfection. A skin rash may occur and there is central nervous system involvement in up \\nto 30% of cases. During the acute phase there may be up to 105 spirochetes per cubic \\nmillimeter of blood. The primary illness resolves within 3-6 days, and terminates abruptly \\nwith hypotension and shock, which may be fatal. Relapse of fever occurs 7-10 days later, \\nand several relapses may take place. \\nLyme Disease \\nLyme disease is a recently described syndrome, originally called lyme arthritis.

The lesion, called erythema migrans, looks \\nsomething like a bull\\'s eye, with a raised erythematous ring that gradually spreads \\noutward and a pale central region. Other early symptoms are fever, headache, stiff neck \\nand dizziness. If not treated or if treated too late, the disease can advance to the second \\nstage, during which cardiace dysrhythmias and neurological symptoms such as facial \\npalsy develop. After several weeks or months, a crippling polyarthritis can attack joints, \\nespecially in the European strain of the agent Some people acquire chronic neurological \\ncomplications that are severely disabling. \\nRICKETISIA \\nThe rickettsia are named after H.T. Ricketts, who discovered American \\'Rocky \\nMountain spotted fever\\'. This group is also referred to as the \\'Spotted fever\\' (typhus fever) \\ngroup after the disease produced by the best known of these pathogens (Rickettsia \\nprowazekiz). Their natural distribution is by host vectors such as lice, fleas, ticks, mites, \\netc in which they exist as harmless parasites or even symbionts. On being transferred \\nto other animal hosts or humans by bites, scratches or inhalation, they produce very \\nserious disease symptoms. \\'GRAM -ve BACTERIA 297 \\nThe Rickettsias are small rods with the fine structure typical of gram-negative \\neubacteria. The genera Rickettsia and Coxiella are obligate intracellular parasites that differ \\nin their location within the host cell. Both enter their host cells by inducing phagocytosis, \\neven by cells that are not normally phagocytic. Within host cells, the rickettsias reproduced \\nby binary fission. They cling together in pairs after fission. Rickettsias are not motile as \\nno flagella have been observed. They do not produce endospores. The organisms were \\nconsidered to be the product of \\' degenerative evolution\\' of bacteria as a result of obligate \\nintracellular parasitism. The DNA extracted from rickettsias is double stranded the \\norganisms are capable of generating their own ATP as evidenced by oxidation of amino \\nacid and glutamate. \\nCoxiella forms endospores that are resistant to drying and other environmental \\nstresses. They are substantially smaller than the vegetative cells, appear to have a reduced \\nmetabolic rate, and they lack dipicolinic acid, a compound characteristic of the endospores \\nof gram-positive bacteria. \\nThe rickettsias cause several human diseases which are transmitted by arthropod \\nvectors such as fleas, mites, lice and ticks.

Ticks that acquire the infection \\nremain infective for a life time. \\nThe genus Rickettsia is currently divided into two antigenically distinct group and \\nthe spotted fever group, which are very closely related. They have a typical gram-negative \\nbacterial cell wall, including a bilayered outer membrane that contain the lipopolysaccharide \\nantigens that distinguish the two groups. External to the outer membrane there appears \\nto be a slime layer, probably composed of polysaccharides. Electrophoresis has demonstrated \\na number of distinct and common proteins in both groups of rickettsiae. The \\nimmunodominant rickettsial outer membrane proteins A (Omp A)· has been studied \\nprincipally in the spotted fever group rickettsiae. It contains a hydrophilic region of tandem \\nrepeat units that determine the diversity of molecular size and antigens largely by the \\nnumber, order and type of repeat units. Omp B is a typical autotransporter protein and \\nis abundant in both groups of rickettsiae. Omp A and Omp B both contain cross reactive \\nand species-specific epitopes. \\nPathogenesis \\nRickettsiae normally enter the body through the bite and dust from hides or pelts \\nof infected animals may contain large numbers of highly infectious spores from dried fecal \\nmaterial of arthropod parasites such as ticks. They are disseminated through the blood \\nstream, enter endothelial cells by induced phagocytosis, escape from the phagosome, \\nmultiply intracellularly and eventually destroy their host cells. Observations in cell culture \\nsystems suggest that spotted fever and typhus group rickettsiae destroy the host cell by \\ndifferent mechanism. \\nA common target in rickettsial infections is the endothelial lining of the small blood \\nvessels. The bacteria recognize, enter and multiply within endothelial cells, causing \\nnecrosis of the vascular living. Among the immediate pathological consequences are \\nvasculities, perivascular infiltration by inflammatory cells, vascular leakage and \\nthrombosis. These pathologic effects are manifested by skin rash, edema, hypotension \\nand gangrene. \\nIntravascular clotting in the brain accounts for the stuporous mental changes and \\nother neurological symptoms that sometimes occur. \\nSpecific Rickettsioses \\nRickettsioses can be differentiated on the basis of their clinical features and \\nepidemiology as: \\n1.

Humans are the only natural \\nvertebrate hosts. Several animals-guinea pigs, mice, cotton rats and gerbils-may be infected \\nexperiment. The human body louse Pediculus humanus corporis is the vector. The head louse \\nmay also transmit the infection but not the public louse. The lice become infected by feeding \\non rickettsiaemic patients. The rickettsiae multiply in the gut of the lice and appear in the \\nfeces in 3-5 days. Lice succumb to the infection within 2-4 weeks, remaining infective till \\nthey die. The lethal nature of the infection in the louse suggests that the association between \\nR. prawazekii and its vector is relatively recent and not well established. Lice may be \\ntransferred from person to person. Infection is transmitted when the contaminated louse \\nfeces is rubbed through the minute abrasions caused by scratching. The disease starts with \\nfever and chills. A characteristic rash appears on the fourth or fifth day, starting on the \\ntrunk and spreading over the limbs but sparing the face, palm and soles. Towards the second \\nweek, the patient becomes stuporous and delirious. The name typhus comes from the cloudy \\nstate of consciousness in the disease (from typhos, meaning cloud or smoke).300 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nEndemic Typhus \\n[Murine or Fleaborne typhus] \\nIt is a milder disease than epidemic typhus. It is caused by. R. hJPhi which is \\nmaintained in nature as a mild infection of rats, transmitted by the rat flea Xenopsylla \\nc1zeopis. The rickettsia multiplies in the gut of the flea and is shed in its feces. The flea \\nis unaffected but remains infectious for the rest of its natural span of life. \\nHumans acquire the disease usually through the bite of infected fleas, when their \\nsaliva or feces is rubbed in or through aerosols of dried feces. Ingestion of food recently \\ncontaminated with infected rat urine or flea feces may also cause infection. Human \\ninfection is a dead end. Man to man transmission does not occur. \\nThe clinical manifestations of endemic typhus include fever, headache, muscle \\naches, and malaise. After five days, a skin rash, transient in milder cases, begins on the \\ntrunk and radiates toward the extremities. Symptoms dissipate in about two weeks. \\nTetracycline and chloramphenicol are effective therapeutic agents, while various pesticides \\nare available for vector and rodent control. \\nScrub Typhus \\nTsutsugamushi Disease \\nThe illness caused by R. tsutsugamushi. Scrub typhus rickettsias live naturally in \\nthe bodies of chigger mites. Infected mammalian and avian hosts help perpetuate the \\nreservoir. Humans are attacked by chiggers (mite larvae) while passing through forests \\nand parkland. The mite feeds on the serum of warm blooded animals only once during \\nits cycle of development and adult mites feed only on plants. The microbes are transmitted \\ntransovarially in mites. Various rodents and birds act as reservoirs. \\nAt the site of a mite bite, a distinctive black scab develops in one to three weeks. \\nEarly symptoms of fever, headache and muscle aches resemble, those of endemic typhus \\nand in about half the cases, a generalized rash originates on the trunk and radiates \\nperipherally. Severe cases are accompanied by mental confusion, delirium, pneumonia and \\ncirculatory collapse. \\nRocky Mountain Spotted Fever \\nRickettsia of this group possess a common soluble antigen and multiply in the \\nnucleus as well as in the cytoplasm of host cells. R. rickettsii, the etiological agent of Rocky \\nMountain spotted fever, discovered by Ricketts in 1906 in smears from infected animals \\nand patients, and later discovered that it was transmitted by ticks, which therefore act \\nas both vectors and reservoirs. The infection may be transmitted to vertebrate hosts by \\nany of the larval stages or by adult ticks. Ticks are not harmed by the rickettsia and remain \\ninfected for life. The rickettsia are shed in tick feces but transmission to human beings \\nis primarily by bite, as the rickettsia also invade the salivary glands of the ticks. All \\nrickettsia of tllis group pass through natural cycles in domestic and wild animals or birds. \\nPathogenesis: After two to four days incubation, the first symptoms are sustained \\nfever, chills, headache and muscular pain. The distinctive spotted rash usually comes onGRAM -ve BACTERIA 301 \\nwithin two to four days after the prodromium. It starts on the wrist and ankles, moves \\nto the arms and legs, converges toward the chest and eventually covers the entire body. \\nEarly lesions are slightly mottled like measles, but later ones are macular, maculopopular \\nand even- petechial. \\nIn severe cases, the enlarged lesions merge and can become necrotic, predisposing \\nto gangrene of the toes or finger tips. Other grave manifestations of diseases are \\ncardiovascular disruption, including hypotension, thrombosis, and hemorrhage. Conditions \\nof restlessness, delirium, convulsions, tremor and coma are signs of the often overwhelming \\neffects on the central nervous system. \\nQ. Fever \\nAs the etiological agent of the disease was unknown, it was refered to as \\'Query\\' \\nor Q fever. As Burnet identified the causative agent as a rickettsia, it was named R. burnetii, \\nlater named Coxiella burnetti. This is highly resistant due to its production of an unusual \\ntype of spores and it is apparently harbored by a wide assortment of vertebrates and \\narthropods, especially ticks. Arthropod vectors play an essential role in transmitting the \\nrickettsia between wild and domestic animals, but transmission to humans is largely by \\nmeans of environmental contamination and airborne spread. \\nSources of infectious material include urine, feces, milk and air borne particles from \\ninfected animals. The primary portals of entry are the lungs, skin, conjunctiva, and \\ngastrointestinal tract. People at highest risk are farm workers meat cutters, wool and leather \\nworkers and lab technicians. The clinical manifestations typical of Coxiella infection are \\nabrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle ache but rarely are skin rashes seen. \\nTrench Fever: The causative agent is Bartollella Quill ta Il a, like epidemic typhus, \\ncycles between humans and lice, but unlike the typhus rickettsia, does not multiply \\nintracellularly and does not kill the louse vector. Highly variable symptoms can include \\na 5-6 day fever, leg pains, especially in the tibial region, headache, chills and muscle \\naches. \\nCat-scratch Disease: Infection connected with a cat scratch or bite. The symptoms \\nstart after 1-2 weeks, with a cluster of small papules at the site of inoculation. In a few \\nweeks the lymph nodes along the lymphatic drainage swell and can become pus-filled. \\nCHLAMYDIA \\nThe Chlamydias are Gram-negative eubacteria that are obligate intracellular parasites \\nand that like Coxiella, have a life cycle that includes a resistant stage that mediates \\ntransmission. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacterial parasite of humans, animals \\nand birds with tropism for squamous epithelial cells and macrophages of the respiratory \\nand gastrointestinal h·acts. They possess both DNA and RNA, have cell wall and \\nribosomes, replicate by binary fission without an eclipse phase and are susceptible to the \\nusual antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents. \\nChlamydias alternate between two distinct stages: \\n(A) A small metabolically inactive, infectious form called the elementary body that \\nis released by the infected host cell, and302 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(B) A larger noninfectious, actively dividing form called the reticulate body that \\ngrows within the host cell vacuoles. This terminology was devised prior to the full \\nrealization of the bacterial nature of the chlamydias. \\nElementary bodies are tiny, dense spheres shielded by a rigid, impervious envelope \\nthat ensures survival outside the eukaryotic host cell. Reticulate bodies are finely \\ngranulated and have thin cell walls. \\nTo emphasize the homology of cellular processes in the chlamydias and other \\nbacteria, we shall call the actively growing cell (reticulate body)-vegetative cell and the \\ninfectious form (elementary body). \\n(6) The elementary bodies \\nare released from the \\nhost cell \\n(5) The reticulate \\nbodies begin to \\nconvert back into \\nelementary bodies \\n(4) The reticulate body \\ndivides successively, \\nproducing multiple \\nreticulate bodies \\nChlamydiospores \\nHost cell \\n(1) The microbe\\'s infectious \\nform, the elementary \\nbody, attaches to a host \\ncell \\nNucleus \\nVacuole forming -.---......~ \\n(2) The host cell \\nphagocytizes the \\nelementary body, \\nhousing it in a \\nvacuole \\nVacuole \\nrf11,/-:-~+-- Reticulate body \\nFig. 4 : Life cycle of Chlamydia \\n(3) The elementary body \\nreorganizes to form a \\nreticulate body \\nThe chlamydiospore is small, with a rigid cell wall; they lack detectable metabolic \\nactivity.

Following a period of growth \\nand division by binary fission, the vegetative cells convert to chlamydiospores.GRAM -ve BACfERIA 303 \\nThe genus Chlamydia contains four species: C. trachomatis; C. psittaci, C. pneumolliae, \\nwhich can affect humans; and the fourth species; C. pecomm created recently to include \\nsome strains affecting ruminants. \\nDiseases of Chlamydia trachoma tis \\nThe reservoir by pathogenic strains of Chlamydia trachoma tis is the human body. \\nThe microbe shows astoundingly broad distribution within the population, often being \\ncarried with no symptoms. Elementary bodies are transmitted in infectious secretions, and \\nalthough infection can occur in all age groups, disease is most severe in infants and \\nchildren. \\nChlamydial Disease of the Eye: The two forms of chlamydial eye disease, ocular \\ntrachoma and inclusion conjunctivitis, differ in their patterns of transmission and ecology. \\nOcular trachoma, an infection of the epithelial cells of the eye, is an ancient disease and \\na major cause of blindness in certain parts of the world. \\nThe first signs of infectious are a mild conjunctival exudates and slight inflammation \\nof the conjunctiva. This is followed by marked infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages \\ninto the infected area.

The gliding bacteria \\nare a mixed collection of gram negative bacteria that live in water and soil. The name \\nis derived from tendency of members to glide over moist surfaces. There are several \\nmorphologic forms, including slender rods, long filaments, cocci & some miniature tree \\nshaped fruiting bodies. \\nA. Unicellular, rod shaped bacteria, including the mycobacteria, the Cytopllaga group \\nand Flexibacter groups. \\nB. The thread like gliding bacterium Chloroflexus \\nC.

Sulphur-free bacteria existing as trichomes such as Vitreoscilla, Leucotlzrix and \\nSaprospira as well as the mouth Oxcillatoria Simollsiella and Alysiella. \\nE. Cyanobacteria, if they are motile at all, move by gliding. \\nThe Flexibacter species are aquatic bacteria. They are long, very flexible cells but not \\nmulticellular. During continuous cultivation these become shorter and eventually fragment \\ninto coccoid cells. Many forms contain carotenoids and show yellow, pink or orange \\npigmentation. \\nBeggiatoa is a colourless, threadlike sulphur bacterium. The cells are filled with304 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nsulphur droplets, which makes the colourless threads appear white. The threads are motile \\nby gliding, Beggiatoa is an aerobic organism and looks like masses of spider\\'s webs either \\ncovering the black putrid mud of slow moving waters or in the sea when water containing \\nhydrogen sulphide is exposed to atmospheric oxygen. The sulphide is oxidized to \\nsulphate. Thiothrix is not freely motile. Bunches or tufts of trichomes are attached by their \\nbases to solid surfaces. Multiplication is by gonidia, which are formed by the rounding \\noff of apical cells. Conidia can glide over solid surfaces. Thiothrix is much more widespread \\nthan Beggiatoa and grows in waters in which rotting organic material gives rise to \\nhydrogen sulphide. \\nVitreoscilla is a colourless, aerobic, multicellular, filamentous bacterium which moves \\nby gliding and multiplies by fragmentation of the filaments. It can be isolated from cow \\ndung. Leucothrix grows epiphytically on marine algae. The sulphur bacterium Thiosphirillopsis \\njloridana and the organotrophic Saprospira graudis can be compared to the helically wound \\ncyanobacterium Spirulina. \\nMyxobacteria are differentiated from other gliding chemoheterotrophs by their high \\nG + C content and unicellular morphology. They are soil bacteria and are characterized \\nin their natural habitat by the formation of fruiting bodies that are very small. Such fruiting \\nbodies are found in decaying plant material, rotting wood, tree bark and on the faeces \\nof herbivores. The vegetative cells are rods, which are usually quite flexible. \\nThe myxobacteria are soil organisms and are usually detected in nature through \\nthe development of their fruiting bodies on solid substrates. Myxobacteria are strict aerobes \\nthat fall into two nutritional subgroups:-\\n(a) Bacteriolytic and (b) Cellulolytic organism \\nMost of the myxobacteria can lyse bacteria by exoenzymes, whilst only the genus \\nPolyangium contains cellulolytic species. \\nWhat sets the myxobacteria apart from other bacteria is the complexity and \\nadvancement of their life cycle. During this cycle, the vegetative cells swarm together and \\ndifferentiate into a many-celled, colored structure called the fruiting body. The fruiting \\nbody is a survival structure that makes spores by a method very similar to that of certain \\nfungi. These fruiting structures are often large enough to be seen with the unaided eye \\non tree bark and plant debris. \\nOn solid media myxobacteria form very extensive flat colonies. When the vegetative \\ncells inside the colonies aggregate, they differentiate into fruiting bodies that differ in \\nshape, size and pigmentation for the various genera and species of the myxobacteria. \\nDuring maturation, the cells inside the fruiting bodies become dormant i.e., they are \\nconverted to myxospores. \\nThe Cytophaga group contains the genera Cytophaga and Sporocytophaga. In contrast \\nto the Myxobacteriales, the cytophagales do not produce furifing bodies. Genera in the \\norder cytophagales exhibit widely differing morphological forms and modes of metabolism. \\nThey are unified by the presence of gliding motion and lack of fruiting body formation. \\nAs a consequence of teir hydrolyfic activities, these gliding bacteria are important \\necolobically in the decomosition of organic matter.GRAM -ve BACTERIA 305 \\nTHE SHEATHED BACTERIA \\nSome filamentous bacteria form tubular envelops described as sheaths (Sphaerotilus \\nllatalls, Leptothrix ochracea) these sheaths consist of heteropolysaccharide containing \\nglucose, glucuronic acid, galactose and fructose.

Reproduction occurs by the \\nliberation of cells from the open apex of the sheath. Three principal genera, Sphaerotilus, \\nLeptothrix and Haliscomenobacter are distinguishable. Sphaerotilus forms thin sheaths, \\nnormally without encrustations of metal oxides. It is found in slowly running streams \\ncontaminated with sewage or other organic matter, where it grows as long, slimy, attached \\ntassels. It also develops in aerobic sewage digestors. \\nThe formation of a sheath enables these bacteria to attach to solid surfaces. This \\nis important to the ecology of these bacteria because many sheathed bacteria live in low \\nnutrient aquatic habitats. By absorbing nutrients from the water that flows by the \\nattached cells, these bacteria conserve their limited energy resources. Additionally, the \\nsheaths afford protection against predators and parasites. In some cases, the sheaths \\nmay be covered with metal oxides. For example, in the genus Leptothrix, sheaths are \\nencrusted with iron or manganese oxides. In other genera, such as Haliscomenobacter, \\nthis does not occur. In the genus Sphaerotilus, the sheath is sometimes encrusted with \\niron oxides. \\nLeptothrix is common in uncontaminated fresh water containing metal salts, where \\nits sheaths are heavily encrusted with hydrated ferric or manganic oxides.

These include organisms like Beggiatoa (utilizing hydrogen sulfide as \\nenergy source), Nitrosomonas (utilizing ammonia as energy source), Thiobacillus (utilizing \\niron), Nitrobacter (using nitries) etc. These microorganisms have simpler nutritional \\nrequirements and can be grown on defined media.

In simple \\nwords, they remove electrons from inorganic substrates such as hydrogen gas, hydrogen \\nsulfide, sulphur or iron and combine them with carbon dioxide and hydrogen. This \\nreaction provides simple organic molecules and a modest amount of energy to drive the \\nsynthetic processes of the cell. \\nThe chemolithotrophs extract electrons from an inorganic energy source and then \\nuse the electrons to generate ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Molecular oxygen \\ngenerally serves as the terminal electron acceptor. The amount of energy gained in \\nmetabolism depends on the energy source and the terminal electron acceptor. \\nANOXYGENIC PHOTOTROPHIC BACTERIA \\nPlants, algae and cyanobacteria which carry out oxygenic photosynthesis use water \\nas the source of electrons and produce oxygen as a product. The earliest photosynthesizing \\norganisms were likely anoxygenic phototrophs. These use hydrogen sulfide or organic \\ncompounds rather than water as a source of electrons when making reducing power in \\nthe form of NADPH, and therefore they do not generate 02\\' They produce an oxidized \\norganic compound or an oxidized form of sulphur, usually elemental sulphur (5) as an \\nend product. Modern anoxygenic phototrophs are a phylogenetically diverse group of \\nbacteria that inhabit a restricted ecological niche that provides adequate light penetration \\nyet little or no 02; most often, they are found in aquatic habitats such as bogs, lakes \\nand the upper layer of muds. \\nThe photosynthetic systems of the anoxygenic phototrophs are fundamentally \\ndifferent from those of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. They have a unique type of \\nchlorophyll called bacteriochlorophyll. This pigment absorbs wave lengths of light that \\npenetrate to greater depths and are not used by other photosynthetic organisms. By \\nproducing elemental sulphur as a by-product of their photosynthesis, anoxygenic \\nphototrophic bacteria probably caused the huge deposits of elemental sulphur that occur \\nin various parts of the world. Certain lakes in North Africa are now to be in the process \\nof forming new sulphur deposits. They contain large populations of anoxygenic phototrophs, \\nand their bottoms are covered with elemental sulphur. \\nThese bacteria are deeply coloured-red, orange, purple and bright green, because \\nof the chlorophyll and accessory photosynthetic pigments they contain. Water samples \\nfrom deep regions of lakes with an abundance of these organisms are also intensely \\ncolored. \\nPhysiologically, these bacteria carry out photosynthesis anaerobically. The anaerobic \\nphotosynthetic bacteria typically occur in aquatic habitats, often growing at the sediment\\xad\\nwater interface of shallow lakes where there is sufficient light penetration to permit \\nphotosynthetic activity, anaerobic conditions are sufficient to permit the existence of these\\' \\norganisms, and there is a source of reduced sulphur or organic compounds to act as \\nelectron donors for the generation of reduced coenzymes.310 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nTABLE 8 \\nCharacteristics of the Major Groups of Phototrophic Bacteria \\nMetabolism Taxonomic group Photosynthetic pigments Electron donors Carbon source \\nAnoxygenic Purple bacteria Bacteriochlorophyll a or b, H2,H 2S,S Organic C or \\nphotosynthesis carotenoids CO 2 \\nAnoxygenic Green bacteria Bacteriochlorophyll a or b, H 2,H2S,S CO 2 \\nphotosynthesis Carotenoids \\nOxygenic Cyanobacteria Chlorophyll a, ~O CO 2 \\nphotosynthesis* phycobiliproteins \\nOxygenic Prochloro bacteria Chlorophyll a + b, ~O CO 2 \\nphotosynthesis J3-carotenes \\nPurple Halobacterium + Bacteriorhodospin Organic C \\nmembrane \\nmediated \\n* Under some conditions, photosynthesis is anoxygenic, and ~S serves as the electron donor. \\n+ A nonautotrophic archaebacterium \\nThe anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria include the Rhodospirillaceae (purple \\nnonsulphur bacteria), Chromatiaceae (purple sulphur bacteria), Chlorobiaceae (green \\nsulphur bacteria), and Cloroflexaceae (green flexibacteria). \\nMembers of the family Chromatiaceae produce carotenoid pigments and may appear \\norange-brown, red-brown, purple-red, or purple-violet.

The cells of Chromatium, ThiOCljStis, Thiosarcina, Thiospirillum \\nand 171iocapsa do not contain gas vacuoles, but some genera of the family Chromatiaceae, \\nsuch as 171iodichjoll and Thiopedia, do contain gas vacuoles that permit an adjustment \\nof cell buoyancy in a water column to a depth appropriate for light intensity and oxygen \\nconcentration, making anaerobic photosynthetic metabolism possible. \\nThe Chlorobiaceae produce green or green-brown carotenoid pigments and are \\nobligately phototrophic. They assimilate carbon dioxide, utilizing sulfide or elemental \\nsulphur as electron donors, and they deposit sulphur granules extracellularly. Because \\nof their colour and sulphur metabolism, the Chlorobiaceae are called the green sulphur \\nbacteria. All members of the Chlorobiaceae are nonmotile. These bacteria often occur in \\necological situations similar to those of the Chromatiaceae. \\nThe Rhodospirillaceae generally produce red-purple carotenoid pigments. Three \\ngenera are recognized: Rhodospirillum has spiral-shaped cells; Rhodopseudomonas hasGRAM -ve BACTERIA 311 \\nspherical or rod-shaped cells that do not form filaments; and exhibit budding division. \\nMembers of the genera Rhodospirillum and Rhodopseudomonas are motile by means of polar \\nflagella, whereas those of the genus RllOdomicrobium are peritrichously flagellated. Their \\nphotosynthetic development depends on the ability of the cells to photo assimilate simple \\norganic compounds. When sulfide or thiosulfate is utilized as an electron donor, elemental \\nsulphur is not deposited within the cell. The organic substrates utilized by the \\nRhodospirillaceae may serve as electron donors for generating reducing power or may \\nbe photoassimilated. Because they generally require preformed organic matter for growth \\nand are able to utilize light energy for generating ATP, the type of metabolism they carry \\nout is sometimes referred to as photoheterotrophic metabolism and the organisms are \\ncalled the purple nonsulfur bacteria. \\nIn the light under anaerobic conditions, typical members of the Rhodospirillaceae \\nuse molecular hydrogen or sulfide as an electron donor and can grow without organic \\ncompounds. As such, these organisms may be viewed as photoheterotrophs or as \\nphotoautotrophs, generally requiring organic growth factor compounds. Indeed, most \\nstrains in the Rhodospirillaceae require one or more vitamins. Clearly, the Rhodospirillaceae \\noccupy a boundary position between autotrophs and heterotrophs. The basic metabolic \\npathways of the Rhodospirillaceae are the same as those of other autotrophic \\nmicroorganisms. Their ability to assimilate organic compounds and the requirement of \\nmany members of the Rhodospirillaceae for such compounds establish the resemblance \\nof these organisms to heterotrophs. \\nOXYGENIC PHOTOTROPHIC BACTERIA \\n} \\nOxygenic photosynthetic bacteria are called oxyphotobacteria. Two orders are \\ncontained in this group of the oxygenic phototrophic bacteria. Cyanobacteriales and \\nProchlorales. Both of these orders occupy intermediate position between the phototrophic \\nbacteria and the eukaryotic algae, indicating a probable evolutionary link to these higher \\nphotosynthetic organisms. The primary photosynthetic pigment in both cases is chlorophyll \\na, but prochlorophytes also possess chlorophyll b, making them very similar to the green \\nalgae. Presumably, the prochlorobacteria are more closely related to the green algae than \\nare the cyanobacteria. Clearly, there is a phylogenetic relationship among the photosynthetic \\norganisms, with the Oxyphotobacteria occupying an intermediate position between the \\nAnoxyphotobacteria and the algae. Cyanobacteria, thought to be the earliest oxygenic \\nphototrophs. These are photosynthetic organisms that use water as a source of electrons \\nfor reducing power, liberating 02\\' \\n6C0 2 + 6H 20 ~ C 6H 120 6 + 602 \\nThey are about the same size and shape as some algae, and they do produce oxygen \\nas algae do. But cyanobacteria are prokaryotes. They have an outer membrane and a thin \\npeptidoglycan wall typical of gram-negative bacteria. \\nToday cyanobacteria still play an essential role in the biosphere. As primary \\nproducers, they harvest the energy of sunlight, using it to convert CO 2 into organic \\ncompounds. They were initially thought to be a form of algae and were called blue green \\nalgae until electron microscopy revealed their prokaryotic structure.312 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nTHE CYANOBACTERIA \\nThe cyanobacteria are a diverse group of more than 60 genera of gram-negative \\nbacteria. They inhabit a wide range of environments, including fresh water and marine \\nhabitats, soils and the surfaces of rocks. Some cyanobacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen. \\nThey obtain their carbon (as CO 2) as well as their nitrogen (as N 2) from the atmosphere. \\nCyanobacteria being photosynthetic, many are able to convert nitrogen gas (N2) to \\nammonia, which can then be incorporated into cell material. In addition they need only \\na few minerals and a light source to grow. Cyanobacteria are the major nitrogen-fixers \\nin nature. \\nCHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF CYANOBACTERIA \\nCyanobacteria are morphologically diverse. They are tough but flourish in almost \\nall environments-oceans, lakes, streams and soil. Some genera are unicellular with typical \\nprokaryotic shapes such as cocci, rods and spirals. Others form filamentous multicellular \\nassociations called trichomes, they mayor may not be enclosed within a sheath, a tube \\nthat holds and surrounds a chain of cells. Motile trichomes glide as a unit. Cyanobacteria \\nthat inhabit aquatic environments often have gas vesicles, enabling them to move vertically \\nwithin the water column. When large numbers of buoyant cyanobacteria accumulate in \\nstagnant lakes or other fresh water habitats, they may form mats on the surface. In the \\nbright, hot conditions of summer, these cells lyse and decay, creating an odiferous scum \\ncalled a nuisance bloom. \\n~ \\n~ \\no \\no \\nCD \\nGloeobacter Synechococcus \\nDermocarpa \\nSpirulina \\nOscillatoria \\n~ I:··~; W .~: \\nGloeothece Gloeocapsa \\nClli:;l I ~ no \\nAnabaena \\nCylindrospermum \\nCalothrix \\nFig. 6 : CyanobacteriaGRAM -ve BACfERIA 313 \\nThe photosynthetic systems of the cyanobacteria are like those contained within the \\nchloroplasts of algae and plants. In addition to light harvesting chlorophyll pigments, \\ncyanobacteria have phycobiliproteins. These pigments absorb energy from wave lengths \\nof light that are not well absorbed by chlorophyll. They contribute to the blue green algae, \\nor sometimes reddish, colour of the cyanobacteria. \\nNitrogen fixing Cyanobacteria \\nThese bacteria are ~ritically important ecologically. Because they can incorporate \\nboth N2 and CO 2 into organic material, they generate a form of these organisms. Thus, \\ntheir activities can ultimately support the growth of a wide range of organisms in \\nenvironments that would otherwise be devoid of usable nitrogen and carbon. \\nNitrogenase, the enzyme complex that mediates the process of nitrogen fixation, is \\ndestroyed by 02; therefore, nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria must protect the enzyme from \\nthe 02 they generate. Species of Anabaena, which are filamentous, isolate nitrogenase by \\nconfining the process of nitrogen fixation to a specialized thick walled cell called a \\n\\'heterocyst\\'. Heterocysts are not photosynthetic and, consequently, do not generate 02\\' \\nThe heterocysts of some species form at very regular intervals within the filaments, \\nreflecting the ability of cells within a trichome to communicate. \\nOne species of Anabaena, A. azolIae, forms an intimate relationship with the water \\nfern Azolla. The bacterium grows and fixes nitrogen within the protected environment of \\na special sac in the fern, providing Azolla with a source of available nitrogen. SYllec1lOcocCllS \\nspecies, which are unicellular, fix nitrogen only in the dark. Consequently, nitrogen \\nfixation and photosynthesis are temporally separated. \\nFilamentous cyanobacteria appear to be responsible for maintaining the structure \\nand productivity of soils in cold desert areas such as the Colorado Plateau. Theil\\' sheaths \\npersist in soil, creating a sticky fibrous network that prevents erosion. In addition these \\nbacteria provide an important source of nitrogen and organic carbon in otherwise nutrient \\npoor soils. \\nThe Prochlorales \\nThe prochlorales are similar to the cyanobacteria except that they also synthesize \\nchlorophyll b. Although they originally were considered to be cyanbacteria, their unique \\nability as prokaryotes to produce chI. b is now considered significant enough to separate \\nthem into their own order. The only known genus, Proc1zloroll, occurs as single celled, \\nextracellular symbionts of marine invertebrates. These bacteria appear bright green on the \\nsurface of the animals with which they are associated. Various species of Proc111oron have \\nbeen recognized in field studies, but until the organisms are grown in pure culture, the \\nvalidity of these species remains ambiguous. \\nTHE PURPLE BACTERIA \\nThe purple bacteria are a small group of gram-negative eubacteria. They are \\nunicellular and reproduce by binary fission or, in a few species by budding. Most are \\nmotile by flagella; a few are immotile. Purple bacteria contain pigments on thylakoids, \\nbut they are different from the cyanobacteria in that they contain a special type of314 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nchlorophyll called bacteriochlorophyll, they do not give off oxygen, and they live in \\nhabitats that lack oxygen. These bacteria are named for their predominant colors. They \\nexist as single cells of many different shapes, and are frequently motile. These bacteria \\nutilize sulphur compounds in their metabolism, and some may deposit intracellular \\ngranules of sulphur or sulfates. These organisms live in various aqueous habitats, \\nincluding sulphur springs, fresh water lakes and swamps. \\nAll purple bacteria are, at least potentially photoautotrophs, capable of growing \\nanaerobically in the light with CO 2 as the carbon source and reduced inorganic \\ncompounds as the electron donor.

The purple bacteria, such as Chromatium, also use sulphur, sulphur compounds \\nor hydrogen gas to reduce carbon dioxide. They are distinguished from the green bacteria \\nby their type of chlorophyll, location of stored sulphur and ribosomal RNA. \\nMany species of purple sulphur bacteria are strict anaerobes and phototrophs, but \\nsome can grow in absence of light aerobically, oxidizing reduced inorganic or organic \\ncompounds as a source of energy.

One important characteristic that \\ndistinguishes them from the purple sulphur bacteria is that they preferentially use a variety \\nof organic molecules rather than hydrogen sulfide as a source of electrons for reducing \\npower. Purple non sulphur bacteria are remarkably versatile metabolically. Most purple316 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nnon-sulphur bacteria can grow aerobically in the absence of light using chemotrophic \\nmetabolism.

In some cases, the cellular extensions have a reproductive function, but \\nin others they have a physiological purpose. Several budding bacteria, such as \\nRhodomicrobium, are associated primarily with other groups on the basis of their characteristic \\nmodes of nutrition. The stalked bacteria live attached to the surface of objects in aquatic \\nenvironments. Budding is the term applied to the mode of multiplication that is \\ncharacteristic for the budding yeasts. Contrary to binary fission, it is an unequal cell \\nQ \\nDeveloping bud \\nFig. 9 : Type of budding bacteriaGRAM -ve BACTERIA 319 \\ndivision which proceeds via localized growth. The daughter cell or bud is usually smaller \\nthan the mother cell and reaches normal size only after it has become separated from \\nthe mother cell. The bud breaks off, enlarges, develops a flagellum and swarms to another \\narea to start its own cycle. These bacteria can also grow in very low nutrient habitats. \\nOne type can even grow in distilled water or tap water. \\nThe budding and appendaged bacteria represent a heterogenous group on the basis \\nof a particular morpholgical feature. In some cases, the cellular extensions have a \\nreproductive function, but in others they have a physiological purpose. \\nBudding and append aged bacteria occur in all nutritional categories. Members of \\nthe genus Galliollella are capable of chemolithotrophic metabolism; they are probably \\nfacultatively chemolithotrophic because they oxidize ferrous to ferric iron and fix carbon \\ndioxide. Galliollella are sometimes considered to be sheathed bacteria because their \\'stalks\\' \\nmay be covered with iron hydroxide. The growth of Galliollella species often causes \\nproblems in iron pipes of water delivery systems. \\nTABLE 13 \\nBudding and Appendaged Bacteria \\nDescription Genus \\nProsthecate bacteria \\nProsthecate with reproductive function; from new cells by budding Hyplzomicrobillnl \\nHypllOnlOllaS \\nProsthecate with no reproductive function \\nNonprosthecate bacteria-Reproduce by budding \\nBacteria with exreted appendages and holdfasts \\nReproduce by binary fission only \\nReproduce by budding \\nGenera of uncertain affiliation \\nPedomicrobium \\nTliiodelldroll \\nCaulobacter \\nAsticcacaulis \\nAllcalomicrobi1l11l \\nProstlzecobacter \\nPros tlzecomicrobill1n \\nStella \\nPasteuria \\nBlastobacter \\nSeliberia \\nGalliollella \\nNevskia \\nPlanctomyces \\nMetallogenium \\nCaulococcus \\nKusnezovia320 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nThe cell appendages of the bacteria in this group, known as prosthecae, provide \\ngreater efficiency in concentratiJ.lg available nutrients.

Many of the bacteria in this group primarily occur in aquatic habitats \\nwhere concentrations of organic matter typically are low. Calliobacter, for example, grows \\nin very dilute concentrations of organic matter in lakes and even in distilled water. Its \\nappendages are referred to as stalks.

To illustrate the variations in G + \\nC ratio, the genus Streptococcus has a low G + C content of 33-34% and the genus \\nClostridium has a low content of 21-54%. \\nBy contrast, filamentous actinomycetes of the genus Streptomyces have a high G + \\nC content of 69-73%. Gram-positive bacteria of a more conventional morphology, such \\nas the genera Conjllebacterillm and Mycobacterium, have, respectively, a G + C content of \\n51-63% and 62-70%. \\nThe Gram-positive bacteria contain a number of anaerobic or facultatively anaerobic \\norganisms, some of these are members of the actinomycete group, many of them are \\nunicellular bacteria unrelated to the mycelial prokryotes. \\nMany Gram positive bacteria share the ability to form a distinctive type of dormant \\ncell known as an endospore. Endospores can be readily recognized microscopically by \\ntheir intracellular site of formation, their extreme refractility, and their resistance to staining \\nby basic aniline dyes that readily stain vegetative cells. They are not normally formed \\nduring active growth and division, their differentiation begins when a population of \\nvegetative cells passes out of the exponontial growth phase as a consequence of nutrient \\nlimitation. \\nMYCOBACfERIA \\nThe mycobacteria are rod shaped, non-spore forming, aerobic bacteria that do not \\nstain readily but, once stained, resist decolorization by acid or alcohol and are therefore \\ncalled acid-fast bacilli. Mycobacteria are invariably aerobic. Morphologically they are \\nintermediate between the corynebacteria and the proactinomycetes (Nocardia). They do not322 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nform. mycelia but grow in the form of irregularly shaped, slightly branched cells. They \\nare non motile and gram-positive. One way in which they differ from corynebacteria is \\nthat they are I acid fast\\'. Mycobacteria and nocardia are not decolourised by acid treatment \\nand are designated I acid fast\\'. A few saprophytic mycobacteria can be decolorized with \\nHCI-alcohol, but not with aqueous HC!. The resistance to acid is due to the high levels \\nof mycolic acid in the cell wall, which make the cells of mycobacteria waxlike and strongly \\nhydrophobic. They usually contain granules and vacuoles, they do not form capsules, \\nflagella or spores. \\nMost are strict aerobes that grow well on simple nutrients and media. Compared \\nwith other bacteria, the growth rate is generally slow, with generation times ranging from \\ntwo hours to several days. Some members of the genus exhibit colonies containing yellow, \\norange or pink carotenoid pigments that require light for development, while others are \\nnon pigmented. \\nWorldwide, millions of people are afflicted with tuberculosis and leprosy; certain \\nopportunistic species loosely grouped into a category called MOTI (Mycobacteria other \\nthan the tubercle bacillus) have become an increasing problem in immunosuppressed \\npatients. \\nCorynebacterium, Mycobacterium and Nocardia exhibit a number of similar features in \\ntheir cell wall composition, as well as differences. Their murein skeleton resembles that \\nof the gram-negative bacteria, but it is complexed with an arabinogalactan, a polysaccharide \\nconsisting of arabinose and galactose. This is bound to lipids, namely, mycolic acids. \\nMycolic acids are branched hydroxyl acids (R\\' -CHOH-CHR 2-COOH) carrying aliphatic \\nchain substituents in position 2 and 3. \\nMYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS \\nThe Tubercle Bacillus \\nMycobacterium tuberculosis is the pathogen causing tuberculosis in human beings and \\nwas described by R. Koch in 1882, the tubercle bacillus is a long, thin rod that grows \\nin sinuous masses or strands called cords. It produces no exotoxins or enzymes that \\ncontribute to infectiousness. Most strains contain complex waxes and a cord factor. \\nCulture of Mycobacterium \\nSimple synthetic media: Large inocula grow on simple media in several weeks. \\nSmall inocula fail to grow in such media because of 1he presence of minute amounts of \\ntoxic fatty acids. The toxic effect of fatty acids can be neutralized by animal serum or \\nalbumin, and the fatty acids may then actually promote growth. Activated charcoal aids \\ngrowth. \\nOleic acid-albumin media: May support the proliferation of small inocula, particularly \\nif Tweens (water-soluble esters of fatty acids) are present (e.g. Dubos\\' medium). Ordinarily, \\nmycobacteria grow in clumps or masses because of the hydrophobic character of the cell \\nsurface. Tweens wet the surface and thus permit dispersed growth in liquid media. Growth \\nis often more rapid than on complex media.GRAM +ve BACTERIA 323 \\nComplex organic media: Small inocula, e.g., samples from patients, are grown on \\nmedia containing complex organic substances, e.g. egg yolk, animal serum, tissue extracts. \\nThese media often contain penicillin or malachite green (e.g. Lowenstein-Jensen medium) \\nto inhibit other bacteria. . \\nGrowth Characteristics \\nMycobacteria are obligate aerobes and derive energy from the oxidation of many \\nsimple carbon compounds. Increased CO 2 tension enhances growth. Biochemical activities \\nare not characteristic, and the growth rate is much slower than that of most bacteria. The \\ndoubling time of tubercle bacilli is 12 hours or more. Saprophytic forms tend to,grow mote \\nrapidly, proliferate well at 22°C, produce more pigment, and be less acid-fast than \\npathogenic forms. \\nResponse to Physical and Chemical Agents \\nMycobacteria tend to be more resistant to chemical agents that other bacteria because \\nof the hydrophobic nature of the cell surface and their clumped growth. Dyes (e.g. \\nmalachite green) or antibacterial agents (e.g. penicillin) that are bacteriostatic to other \\nbacteria can be incorporated into media without inhibiting the growth of tubercle bacilli. \\nAcids and alkalies permit the survival of some exposed tubercle bacilli and are used for \\nconcentration of clinical specimens and partial elimination of contaminating organisms. \\nTubercle bacilli are fairly resistant to drying and survive for long periods in dried sputum. \\nVariation: Variation can occur in colony appearance, pigmentation, cord factor \\nproduction, virulence, optimal growth temperature, and many other cellular or growth \\ncharacteristics. \\nSpecies \\nM. tuberculosis \\nM. bovis \\nM. kansasii \\nM. avium-intracellulare \\nM. fortuitum-dle/onel \\nM.leprae \\nPATHOGENICITY \\nTABLE 1 \\nPathogenicity of Mycobacteria \\nHuman Guinea Pig \\n+++ +++ \\n+++ +++ \\n+++ \\n+ \\n+ \\n++ \\nFowl Cattle \\n+++ \\n+++ \\nThere are marked differences in the ability of different mycobacteria to cause lesions \\nin various host species. \\nMycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis are equally pathogenic for humans. \\nThe route of infection (respiratory versus intestinal) determines the pattern of lesions. In \\ndeveloped countries, M. bovis has become very rare. Some typical mycobacteria (e.g.324 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMycob(lcterium kansasil) produce human disease indistinguishable from tuberculosis; others \\n(e.g., Mycobacterium fortuitum) cause only surface lesions or act as opportunists. \\nConstituents of Tubercle bacilli \\nThe constituents listed below are found largely in cell walls. Mycobacterial cell walls \\ncan induce delayed hypersensitivity, induce some resistance to infection, and replace \\nwhole mycobacterial cells in Freund\\'s adjuvant. Mycobacterial cell contents only elicit \\ndelayed hypersensitivity reactions in previously sensitized animals. \\nLipids: Mycobacteria are rich in lipids. Many complex lipids, fatty acids, and waxes \\nhave been iSolated from them. In the cell the lipids are largely bound to proteins and \\npolysaccharides. Some such complexes have been isolated. Lipids are probably responsible \\nfor most of the cellular tissue reactions to tubercle bacilli. Phosphatide fractions can \\nproduce tubercle like cellular responses and cause necrosis. Lipids are to some extent \\nresponsible for acid-fastness. When mycobacteria are defatted with ether, this staining \\nproperty is lost. Analysis of the lipids by gas chromatography can reveal species-specific \\npatterns that aid in classification. \\nVirulent strains of tubercle bacilli form microscopic serpentine cords in which acid\\xad\\nfast bacilli are arranged in parallel chains. Cord formation is correlated with virulence. \\nA cord factor (trehalose-6, 6\\'-dimycolate) has been extracted from virulent bacilli with \\npetroleum ether. It inhibits migration of leukocytes, causes chronic granulomas, and can \\nserve as an immunologiC adjuvant. \\nProteins: Each type of Mycobacterium contains several proteins that elicit the \\ntuberculin reaction. Proteins bound to a wax fraction can, upon injection, induce tuberculin \\nsensitivity. They can also elicit the formation of a variety of antibodies. \\nPolysaccharides: Mycobacteria contain a variety of polysaccharides. Their role in the \\npathogenesis of disease is uncertain. They can induce the immediate type of hypersensitivity \\nand can interfere with some antigen-antibody reactions in vitro. \\nPathogenesis \\nMycobacteria produce no recognized toxins. Organisms in droplets of 1-5 ~m are \\ninhaled and reach alveoli. The disease results from establishment and proliferation of \\nvirulent organisms and interactions with the host. Virulent bacilli (e.g. BCG) survive only \\nfor months or years in the normal host. Resistance and hypersensitivity of the host greatly \\ninfluence the development of the disease. \\nPathology: The production and development of lesions \\nOther Mycobacteria \\nIn addition to tubercle bacilli (M tuberculosis, M bovis), other Mycobacteria of varying \\ndegrees of pathogenicity have been grown from human sources in past decades. These \\natypical mycobacteria were initially grouped according to speed of growth at various \\ntemperatures and production of pigments.GRAM +ve BACfERIA 325 \\nMycobacterium \\na-Nocardia \\n~-Nocardia \\nDermatophilus Streptomyces \\nActinoplanes Streptosporanaium \\nFig. 1 : Mycobacteria, Nocardia and Actinomyces326 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nA few species or complexes that are significant in medicine are outlined below: \\nMycobacterium kansasii: M. kansasii is a photochromogen that requires complex \\nmedia for growth at 3\\'?C. It can produce pulmonary and systemic diseaSe indistinguishable \\nfrom tuberculosis, especially in patients with impaired immune responses. Sensitive to \\nrifampin, it is often treated with rifampin + ethambutol + INH with good clinical response. \\nThe source of infection is uncertain, and communicability is low or absent. \\nMycobacterium avium-intracellular complex: The members of this group grow \\noptimally at 41°C and produce smooth, soft colonies with little colour. Able to infect birds, \\nthey cause spontaneous human disease infrequently. Infection with M. intracellular, \\nhowever, is common in the southeastern USA, where the organisms occurs in soil and \\nwater, and results in skin test reactions to PPD-B. Overt pulmonary disease occurs mainly \\nin immuno-deficient persons. Resistance to antituberculosis drugs is common, and disease \\ndue to this organism requires treatment with rifampin + ethambutol + streptomycin or \\ncycloserine for many months. \\nMycobacterium scrofulaceum: This is a scotochromogen, occasionally found in water \\nand as a saprophyte in adults with chronic lung disease. It is the commonest cause of \\nchronic cervical lymphadenitis in small children and rarely causes other granulomatous \\ndisease. Surgical excision of involved cervical lymphadenitis in small children and rarely \\ncauses othe~ granulomatous disease. Surgical excision of involved cervical lymph nodes \\nmay be curative, whereas resistance to antituberculosis drugs is common. Occasionally, \\ninfection responds to combined treatment with INH + rifampin + streptomycin or \\ncycloserine. \\nMycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium ulcerans: These organisms occur in \\nwater, grow best at low temperature (31°C), may infect fish, and can produce superficial \\nskin lesions (ulcers, swimming pool granulomas) in humans. Surgical excision, tetracyclines, \\nand antituberculosis drugs may be tried in therapy. Mycobacterium fortuitum-chelonei \\nComplex: These are saprophytes found in soil and water that grow very rapidly in vitro \\nand form no pigment. They can produce superficial and systemic disease in humans on \\nrare occasions. M. chelonei has contaminated porcine valves used as prostheses in human \\ncardiac surgery.

Rosenbach (1886) demonstrated a slender \\nbacillus with round terminal spores in case of tetanus.

It is a very serious disease with a high rate of \\nmortality (80-90%). It is very common in developing countries where climate is warm and \\nrural areas where soil is fertile and highly cultivated (where human and animal \\npopulation lives in close association and unhygienic practices are common). \\n• Prevention is by active immunization. \\nC. botulinum was 1st isolated by Van Frmengem (1896) \\n• 8 types of C. botulinum have been identified (Type A,B,C1,C2,D,E,F,G) based on \\nimmunological difference in the toxins produced by them). \\n• They produces powerful exotoxin responsible for pathogenicity and it is not \\nreleased during the life of the organism, produced intra cellularly and appears \\nin the medium only on the death and autolysis of the cell. \\n• C. difficle is not found to be responsible for antibiotic associated colitis by the \\nproduction of an enterotoxin as well as cytotoxin. \\nACfINOMYCETES \\nActinomycetes was first discovered by Ferdinand Cohn in 1875 and it was first \\nnamed as Actinomyces by Harz in 1877. It was first recognized by Gasperini in 1890 \\nas potential destroyers of bacteria and fungi. Morphologically, actinomycetes fall between \\nfungi and bacteria (mould like bacteria). In many respects they resemble fungi, and for \\nthat reason they are known as ray fungi. Their filamentous nature, branching pattern, \\nand conidia formation are similar to those of fungi. Their size and spore characters are \\nsimilar to bacteria. Recent detailed studies have brought out clearly that actinomycetes \\nare quite distinct from the fungi and bacteria in many respects. Their natural occurrence \\nis mostly restricted to soils. They are gram + ve and are related to the coryneform bacteria \\nand mycobacteria by an almost conteneous sequence of intermediate form. The actinomycete \\ncolonies are characteristic in several respects. They produce mass of growth to form a \\ncolony, but an actinomycete colony differs from the bacterial colony in that it consist of \\na mass of filamentous threads with spore-bearing hyphae. They consist of vegetative and \\nsporogenous hyphae. The vegetative mycelium is lichinoid and exists below the surface \\nof the agar medium. The colour of the vegetative mycelium may vary, and it may also \\nproduce soluble pigments in the medium. \\nThe aerial mycelium emerges from the vegetative hyphae in the medium. The type \\nof aerial mycelium varies with the genus and species of the actinomycetes. The chief \\ncharacteristics of spore-bearing hyphae are illustrated. The sporogenous hyphae vary in \\nlength and may be formed in chains, whorls, tufts, or in spring. The method of branching \\nof the hyphae also is characteristic of the species, and serves as a basis for speciation \\nof Streptomyces. Actinomycetes produce true conidia or chlamydospores. Due to \\nsegmentation of old hyphae, cylindrical spores are produced. In the case of sporulation, \\nelectron microscopic studies have revealed that the spores are formed within the hyphal \\nwall, the hyphal contents divide simultaneously to form separate dense particles, whichGRAM +ve BACTERIA 331 \\nare transformed into chains. In some species the hyphal wall persists in the form of a \\nsheath, even after the liberation of the spores. The spores may be spherical, oval or \\ncylindrical. On germination of the spores, formation of one or two germ tubes has been \\nreported. From the germ tubes primary hyphae are formed, which give rise to a network \\nof thin mycelium. In the substrate the mycelium is thin, vegetative, and of varying colour. \\nThe growth of actinomycetes on solid or liquid medium results in characteristic colonies \\nor masses. The cells can be readily stained with methyl-violet, carbol-fuchsin or methylene\\xad\\nblue. They are mainly gram-positive and the acid fastness varies with the genera. In some \\nspecies club formation, which is similar to capsule formation in bacteria, has been reported. \\nA few species of actinomycetes have been reported to be motile, but the presence of flagella \\nhas not been conclusively proved. \\nActinophages have been isolated and shown to be specific pathogens for streptomyces. \\nThey resemble bacteriophages in most respects. For this reason, actinomycetes are believed \\nto be closer to bacteria than fungi. \\nNocardia generally forms small circular transparent glistering colonies on gelatin, \\nand round, curved, slightly arborescent or pink colonies on agar media. Aerial mycelium \\nis colourless and irregular. Actinomyces spp. show scanty growth in gelatin, whereas \\nStreptomyces spp. produce grey colonies, sometime with soluble pigmentation. Some \\nstreptomycetes produce punctiform colonies with white aerial mycelium. \\nMicromonospora \\nActtnomyces \\nNocardia \\nWaksmanta \\nThermomonospora Thennopolyspora Thennoactmomyces StreptosporanglUm \\nFig. 2 : Some actinomycetes showing spore bearing hyphae332 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nNocardias are peculiar in their rapid segmentation of the mycelium into irregularly \\nshaped cells, filaments, rods or cocci. This polymorphism has c~used considerable \\nconfusion in the taxonomic literature. In some cases they multiply by budding to produce \\ncolonies similar to those of micrococci. The concentration and segmentation of the \\nprotoplasm in the filaments is commonly observed. In some older cultures, chlamydospores \\nare also seen. Some nocardias exhibit motility at certain stages of their growth. When \\nstained, young nocardias show undifferentiated protoplasm. The conidia are produced \\nsingly at the end of simple or branched conidiophores. Sporangiospores are borne inside \\nthe hyphal strands, and they are usually spherical in shape. The cell wall substance is \\nneither chitin nor cellulose and it is not resistant to desiccation unlike in streptomycetes. \\nActinomyces spp. are pathogenic in many instances, and are anaerobic or \\nmicroaerophilic. They branch in a characteristic angular manner. Their colonies are tough \\nand sometimes diptheroid. \\nStreptomycetes are mostly aerobic and soil-dwellers, except for a few plant pathogenic \\nspecies. Many streptomycetes degrade cellulose, chitin and other recalcitrant natural \\nsubstances. The vegetative mycelium usually does not fragment into bacillary or coccoid \\ncells whereas conidia are borne in sporophores. Typical aerial mycelium is much \\nbranched, and the conidia are formed in chains. The conidia formation patterns broadly \\ndivided into five groups, viz. (a) straight sporulating hyphae. (b) spore-bearing hyphae \\narranged in clusters, (c) spiral formation in aerial mycelium with long and open spirals \\n(d) spiral formation of the aerial mycelium, short and compact, and (e) spore-bearing \\nhyphae arranged on the mycelium in whorls or tufts. In some cases the capacity to produce \\nconidia and aerial mycelium may be lost due to continued culturing in artificial media. \\nMicromollospora spp. are non-septate and thin. They do not form aerial mycelium \\nbut spread well inside the agar medium. The substrate hyphae are branched with cross\\xad\\nwalls and the aerial mycelium is either not formed or rudimentary. They multiply by \\nconidia formation, either singly at the end of special condiophores, which may be \\nbranched, or in clusters. \\nThe genus Waksmmlia (Microbisporn) is characterized by the formation of spores in \\npairs on aerial conidiophores. The mycelium may be substrate or aerial, and the aerial \\nmyceliunl bears spores which are formed in longitudinal pairs. There are four genera \\nwhich comprise the thermophilic group of actinomycetes. They are: (i) Tl1ermomonospora \\nwhich has long aerial hyphae, forming spores singly on simple or branched sporophores; \\n(ii) Tlzenllopolyspora which has long hyphae with spores produced in pairs or long chains; \\n(iii) TIler11loactinolllyces which has spores singly or in chains, originating directly from the \\nsubstrate mycelium. This is thermophilic and occurs as part of the bacterial flora of damp \\nhaystacks and piles of organic waste where heat is generated. Their spore resemble the \\nendospore of Bacillus and Clostridium. (iv) Pseudollocardia which has septate substrate \\nmycelium, with spores formed from both aerial and substrate mycelium. Some species of \\nStreptomyces are also thermophilic and are grouped among the above four genera. Two \\nother genera of actinomycetes which are less commonly known are: (1) Actilloplmles which \\nhave no aerial mycelium, but produce motile sporangiospores inside sporangial bodies, \\nand (2) Streptospormlgiu11I which has aerial mycelium with coiled sporangiophores andGRAM +ve BACTERIA 333 \\nnon-motile sporangiospores formed inside sporangial bodies. There are also several other \\nincompletely described morphological forms of actinomycetes. \\nIt is easy to differentiate primary and secondary mycelia under the micro-scope: \\nsecondary mycelium is thicker and darker in colour; their cells are roughly of the same \\nthickness as bacteria, i.e. 0.6 to 1.8 Ilm. The division is also bacteria-like in most cases. \\nThe cell wall is also gram-positive and some are acid-fast, and the wall is composed of \\nmucopolysaccharides, together with 2 percent lipid, whereas fungi contain chitin, cellulose \\nand lignin. Thus, cytologically actinomycetes resemble bacteria. \\nThe carbon content (45%) of the actinomycetes cell is not much different from that \\nof fungi and bacteria. Actinomycetes have a nitrogen content of 10%, which is more than \\nthat of fungi, and are closer to bacteria. The amino acid content of actinomycetes and \\nbacteria is almost similar. The work on the mycobacteria has shown that 63% of lipid \\nis present in the cell. In other actinomycetes, the aerial mycelium contains more lipid than \\nthe primary or vegetative mycelium. Streptomyces griseus contains 14% lipid, as against \\n4.4 % in Bacillus subtilis. Cellulose and chitin are absent in Streptomyces. \\nWhen treated with 30% KOH, the cell wall of actinomycetes disappears. If cellulose \\nand chitin are present, they are not soluble in 30% KOH. Lysozyme, which is specific \\nfor mucopolysaccharides, can lyse the cell wall of actinomycetes. Besides, hexosamine \\nhas been detected in the cell wall of Streptomyces spp. S. fradiae and S. griseus contain \\n18.48 % and 19.9% hexosamine, respectively, as against 2 to 3 % in Nocardia spp. There \\nis most of hexose in Nocardia than in Streptomyces. The protein contents of Streptomyces \\nand Nocardia have been studied and found to be similar. Arginine, lysine, hexosamine, \\nalanine, valine, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, glutamic acid, diaminopimelic \\nacid, asparagines, etc are the common amino acids found in these proteins. \\nThe dry powdery appearance of the aerial mycelium of actinomycetes, and the \\ndifficulty of wetting the spores appears to be due to the presence of lipids in their cell \\nwalls. In 1954 O.T. Avery and F. Blank reported that representative species of Actinomyces, \\nNocardia, Streptomyces and Micromollospora were all devoid of chitin and cellulose, and \\nthis is indicative of their closer relationship to bacteria than to fungi. Though several \\nscientists attempted to demonstrate the presence of nucleus in actinomycete cells, the first \\nconvincing account came from L. Grigorakis who in 1931 found that in the thallus of \\nActinomyces bovis, the nuclei divided amitotically, whereas in the aerial spores nucleus \\ncould not be demonstrated. By the Feulgen test some scientists found diffused staining \\nof granules in the cells of actinomycets. Some evidence for the presence of discrete nuclei \\nin the spore-bearing mycelium and in conidia has been obtained. \\nStudies on the cell constituents have indicated the presence of several substances \\nof serological specificity. Diaminopimelic acid derivative and glycogen, manopyrannose, \\narbofuranose, amino sugars, rhamnopyrannose, etc and fat bodies have been reported i\\'l \\nthe young mycelia of Nocardia, Streptomyces and Micromonospora. Several known fatty acids \\nand a new one, named nocardic acid in Nocardia asteroides, have been studied. Presence \\nof vacuoles are commonly found. Volutin and fat globules are also found. \\nThe proponents of two-phase cycle in actinomycetes postulate a haploid substratal334 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nmycelium and diploid aerial mycelium. The presence of certain more or less spherical \\nstructures, believed to be nuclei, has been shown in electron microscopic investigations \\nof Streptomyces griseus. Both nuclear fusion and reduction division are believed to take \\nplace before vegetative growth sets in. Several workers have also observed irregular \\ndistribution of nuclear material in the cell cytoplasm, more than two nuclei in each cell, \\nirregular septation of the mycelium resulting in multinucleate or uninucleate cells, etc. \\nActinomycosis \\nActinomycosis may be defined as the disease caused by Actinomycetes. It has been \\nreported that generally the most affected sites of the body are lungs, jaws and intestine. \\nThe actinomycosis is a chronic pus forming disease caused by the microorganism \\nof the group actinomyces. The disease spreads to surrounding tissue no matter of what \\ntype the tissue may be that means there exists no limitation of anatomical barriers. There \\nmay be a rare hematogenous spread followed by the formation of sinus (enormously \\nexpended vein) tracts that drains suppurative lesions. The granulomatous tumours are \\nformed which usually suppurate discharging a thick, oily pus containing yellowish \\ngranules (sulphur granules). \\nTABLE 2 \\nComparison of Actinomycetes and Moulds \\nAdinomycetes \\n1.

Actinomycetes have provided many \\nimportant bioactive compounds of commercial value and continue to be routinely screened \\nfor new bioactive compounds. These searches have been remarkably successful and \\napproximately two thirds of naturally occurring antibiotics including many of medical \\nimportant have been isolated from actinomycetes.GRAM +ve BACTERIA 335 \\nAll over the world scientists screening actinomycetes at various levels for the \\ndiscovery of high value metabolites because of the following major reasons: \\n• Excellent tract record \\n• Chemical diversity \\n• Chemical surprise \\n• Inherent biological activity \\nAccessing microbial biosynthetic diversity has historically involved the isolation \\nand cultivation of chemically prolific taxa, of those now recognized as such bacteria with \\nin the order actinomycetales. The value of actinomycetes to society in terms of providing \\nuseful drugs, especially antibiotics and anticancer agents and to the pharmaceutical \\nindustry for revenue generating discovery platform, is indisputable. Actinomycete \\ncompounds or derivatives there of accounted for approximately two thirds of the naturally \\noccurring antibiotics as of 1988, making them one of the single most important sources \\nof prescription drugs. These bacteria, which are best known from soils, have been the \\nfocus of aggressive research efforts since the discovery of actinomycin in 1940 from \\nActinomyces antibioticus by Selman Waksman at Rutgers University. Additional actinomycete \\nproducts such as antibiotics like streptomycin and novobiocin and firmly cemented these \\nchemically prolific bacteria in the centre stage of natural products drug discovery research \\n(Jenson et al., 2003). \\nSo many high value metabolites (both primary and secondary metabolites) of \\ncommercial importance have been produced by cultivation of members of this group for \\nthe past 50-60 years and new compounds are discovered, patented and marketed every \\nyear. A search for recent literature revealed that at least 4,607 patents have been issued \\non actinomycete related productS and processes (Labeda and Shearer, 1990). Out of 22,500 \\ntotal bioactive secondary metabolites 10,100 (45%) are reported to produced from \\nactinomycetes (7630 from Streptomycetes and 2470 from rare actinomycetes). The number \\nof bioactive compounds produced from common actinomycetes and the group of compound \\nproduced are presented in table 3 & 4. \\nTABLE 3 \\nNumber of Bioactive Compounds Produced from Common Actinomycetes \\nGenus 1974 1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2005 \\nStreptomyces 1934 2784 3477 4877 5645 6600 7630 \\nMicromollospora 41 129 269 398 492 535 740 \\nActinomadura 0 16 51 164 248 315 345 \\nStreptoverticillium 19 41 64 168 169 244 258 \\nNocardia 45 74 107 262 270 287 357 \\nActinoplanes 6 40 95 146 169 195 248 \\nStreptosporangium 7 20 26 39 57 66 79336 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nTABLE 4 \\nMajor Groups of Bioactive Secondary Metabolites \\nType of activity Actinomycetes Fungi Other bacteria Total \\nPharmacologically / \\nImmunologically active agents 230 750 80 1060 \\nEnzyme inhibitors 380 150 40 570 \\nPhytotoxins/Herbicides 80 380 50 510 \\nPesticides 360 85 10 455 \\nMicrobial regulators 30 30 20 80 \\nOther active agents 320 2305 700 3325 \\nTotal number 1400 3700 900 6000 \\nAntibiotics 8700 4900 2900 16,500 \\nBioactive microbial secondary \\nmetabolites (total) 10100 8600 3800 22,500 \\nThe secondary metabolites produced by actinomycetes possess different kinds of \\nactivity. The secondary metabolites are very complex in structure it needs so many enzymes \\nfor its synthesis. For example nearly 30 different enzymes are involved in the synthesis \\nof the antibiotic streptomycin. Such kind of complex synthesis is not easy to carry out \\nchemically and another important point is a single secondary metabolite may exhibit \\ndifferent activity. Avermectin-a secondary metabolite produced by Streptomyces avermetilis \\nwhich showed antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic and insecticidal activity. Another \\nexample is the ascomycin was reported in 1962 as an antifungal antibiotic produced by \\nS. hygroscopicus var. ascomyceticus. The later study showed that this culture produces \\nimmunosuppressive activity and further analysis revealed that ascomycin is composed \\nof two compounds that is FR900520 and FR900523, related to the immunosuppressive \\nFK506 (Hatanaka et al., 1988) which is produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis. This kind \\nof surprising activity exhibited by actinomycete compounds is one of the reasons for the \\nstanding of actinomycetes among the various kinds of industrial important microorganisms. \\nAntibiotics from Actinomycetes \\nSecondary metabolism and secondary metabolite production is a parental character \\nof actinomycetes which are produced at the end of the stationary phase (idiophase) and \\nare not necessary for the growth of actinomycetes. Antibiotic is one of the major secondary \\nmetabolite produced by most actinomycetes which confers the antagonistic properties to \\nit. The antibiotics include antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic and antihelminthic \\nagents. Most actinomycetes produce chemically diverse group of bioactive compounds \\nincluding antibiotics with inherent biological activity. It is difficult to produce which \\ngenera of actinomycete produce specific chemical group of antibiotics. Another important \\npoint to remember is the antibiotic (secondary metabolite) production is not a genus orGRAM +ve BACTERIA 337 \\nspecies specific, it is strictly a strain 5 specific process. But if one is interested in specific \\nclass of compounds, it is useful to have some background knowledge which is produced \\nby strains of specific genera (Table 5). But it is not true in all the cases (Labeda and Shearer, \\n1990). A novel antiviral agent, fattiviracin FV-8, purified from the culture broth of \\nstreptomyces microflavus strain No. 2445, was reported to have potent antiviral activities \\nagainst human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-l), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-\\n1) varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and influenza A and B viruses (Habib et al., 2001). \\nTABLE 5 \\nSome of the Major Class of Antibiotics and their Producing Actinomycete Genera \\nChemical class of antibiotic \\nAminoglycosides \\nMacrolide and ansamacroIide \\nOepsipeptide \\nPolvether ionophores \\nActinomycete \\nStreptomyces \\nMicromollospora \\nActilloplmles \\nActinomadura \\n000EUKARYOTA \\nAll living cells can be divided into two groups, prokaryotes and eukaryotes, based \\non their ultra structure as seen with the EM. In the microbial world, bacteria, cyanobacteria \\nare prokaryotes. Other cellular microbes-fungi (yeast & molds) protozoa, algae are \\neukaryotes. The eukaryotic cell is a complex compartmentalized unit that differ from the \\nprokaryotic cell in containing a definite nucleus and several other specialized structures \\nlike cell organelles. Although exact cell structures differ somewhat among the several \\ngroups of eukaryotic organisms, the eukaryotic cell is the typical cell of certain microbial \\ngroups (fungi, algae, protozoans and helminth worms) as well as animal and plants. \\nThe term eukaryotes (from the greek-true nucleus) have linear structures of DNA \\ncalled chromosomes. These are associated with chromosomal proteins called histone \\nprotein. These chromosome are found in the cell\\'s nucleus, which is separated from the \\ncytoplasm by a nuclear membrane. Eukaryotes also have a mitotic apparatus (various \\ncellular structure that participate in a type of nuclear division called mitotis). \\nEvidence from paleobotany indicates that the first eukaryotic cells appeared on earth \\napproximately two billion yrs ago. -One appealing theory suggest that these cells evolved \\nfrom prokaryotic organism by a process of intracellular symbiosis. The structure of these \\nnew cells was so versatile that eukaryotic microorganism soon spread out into available \\nhabitats and adopted greatly diverse styles of living. \\nThe first primitive eukaryote were probably single celled and independent, but over \\ntime, some forms began to aggregate, forming colonies. With further evolution some of \\nthe cells, \",ithin the colonies become specialized or adopted to perform particular function \\nadvantageous to whole colony such as locomotion, feeding or reproduction. \\nAt some point as individual cells in the organism lost the ability to survive apart \\nfrom the intact colony, the scene was set for the development of more complex multicellularEUKARYOTA 339 \\norganism. A multicellular organism is more than just an assemblage of cell like a colony \\nbut it is composed of distinct groups of cells that can\\'t exist independently of rest of the \\nbody. The cell grouping of multicellular organism that have a specific function are termed \\ntissues, and groups of tissues make up organs. \\nAll protozoa, algae, fungi live a unicellular or colonial existence. Truly multicellular \\norganism are found only among plants and animals and some of the fungi and algae. \\nOnly certain eukaryotes are small enough to fall into the realm of microbiology, the \\nprotozoa, fungi and algae. The fungi, algae, and protozoa are the eukaryotic microorganism \\nevolved along three distinct lines of nutrient, cellular and energy acquisition. The fungi \\nabsorb nutrients from host or are parasitic or saprophytic. The algae carry out \\nphotosynthesis to form cellular ATP. Protozoa acquire nutrients and energy through \\ningestion of organic compounds often using phagocytosis to bring nutrients into the cell. \\nFungi typically form filamentous mycelia but one group the yeast are characteristically \\nunicellular. The fungi are classified largely on the basis of their modes of reproduction. \\nThe sexual spores of fungi are the most important features used in classification and \\nidentification of fungi. \\nThe algae are classified largely on the basis of pigment production and biochemical \\nnature of reserve food material. \\nThe protozoa are classified largely on their modes of locomotion. \\nNext following headings contain a generalized survey of principal eukaryotic micro \\norganism viz. - algae, fungi, slime molds, protozoa etc. \\nALGAE \\nAlgae comprise a group of chlorophyll containing thalloid plants of the simplest \\ntype, having no true roots, stems, leaves or leaf like organs. They are placed in the division \\nThallophyta along with fungi. They differ from fungi in the presence of chlorophyll \\n(photosynthetic pigment) and in their mode of nutrition. Although most of the algae are \\nautotrophic, i.e. they synthesize their food by themselves, yet heterotrophic and holozoic \\nforms are not uncommon. The term algae is used even if the plant is a unicellular. The \\nthallus is non-vascular and thus has no elements for the transport of fluids. The algae \\ncan afford this simplicity because with only a few exceptions they are water dwellers. \\nThey have non jacketed, either unicellular sexorgans or multicellular in which every cell \\nproduce a gamete. Most of them are among the simplest in the plant kingdom. \\nGeneral Characters \\n1. Mostly aquatic (marine & fresh) \\nDiverse habitats-below the soil level, moist rocks, wet logs, snow etc. \\n2.

Aggregated cells formed irregular colony, and cells multiples \\nregularly. \\n(i) Palmelloid: Circular, non motile cells embedded into gelatinous matrix. Shape· \\nand number of cells are not fixed. Each cell of the colony is free physiologically from \\neach other. eg- Tetraspora, Palmella, Mieroeystis. \\n(ii) Dendroid: Appeared like a small microscopic tree. The branched structure of \\nthe tree is made up due to mucilaginous threads. eg- Chrosodendroll \\n(iii) Rhizopodial: Each cell of the colony fixed with rhizopodia. Eg-ChnJsidiastru11l. \\n(b) Colonoid: Definite size and shape of the colony. Number of cells in colony is \\nalso fixed. The colony is also known as coenobium. They are of two types: \\n(i) Flagellated/Motile: Flagellated cells are connected with plasmodesmata and \\ncircular in shape. Eg- Pandorina, Eudorilla, Volvox \\n(ii) Non flagellated: Non motile cells are present in the colony. Different shapes \\nof the coenobium like, circular, plate or mat colony present. eg.-Padiastrum, Seenedesmus \\nand Hydrodietyon. \\n(c) Filamentous Thallus: These forms of algae are formed by regular division of the \\ncells. They join in a line giving rise to a filamentous form daughter cells arrange in linear \\nforms. In this type, cells are non motile and appeared in a filamentous shape. These \\nfilaments could be either. \\n(i) Unbranched filaments: Simple unbranched filaments are found in members of \\nSpirogrJra, Oedogonium, Ulothrix, Nos toe, etc. In Ullothrix and Oedogonium, hold fast \\ncell present at the basal end of the filament. Free floating filaments are found in \\nSpirogyra. \\n(ii) Branched filaments: Branching can be seen due to the presence of lateral out \\ngrowth at the lower part of filament, followed by formation of transverse septum. eg\\xad\\nPithophora, Cladophora \\nThree types of branching are as follows:-\\n(a) Simple: Thallus made by single filament with a basal cell at basal end. Except \\nbasal cell, other cell induce branching eg - Cladophora. In this type the branching trichomes \\nare attached with the help of basal cell to the substratum on which they grow.344 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(b) Heterotrichous: Both erect and prostrate branching present more evolve thallus \\nas compare to simple one. eg- Coleochaete, Ectocarpus \\n(c) Pseudoparenchymatous: In some members, filaments and branches joined \\ntogether longitudinally or transversely and develops pseudoparenchymatous type of \\nthallus. Depending upon the number of main filament forming the thallus, it is called \\nas uniaxial or multiaxial. \\n1. Uniaxial: When uniaxial branches are fused. Here only the single central \\nfilament possesses an apical cell and this is capable of independent growth eg.\\xad\\nBatrachospermum. \\n2. Multiaxial: When two or more filament develops from a single basal cell and \\nfused together. eg- Polysiphonia \\n(d) Siphonous: Thallus develops from tubular, aseptate branched and multinuclear \\nfilaments. eg~ Vaucheria, Botrydium \\n(e) Parenchymatous: Cellular division in different planes, convert a parenchymatous \\nbody, where daughter cells fused together.

The prokaryotic cells which constitute thalli of cyanophytes (blue-green algae) \\nhave a cell wall which contains a specific strengthening component not found in the cell \\nwalls of other algae. It is mucopeptide. The DNA material representing the nuclear body346 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nconsists of fibrils which may extend throughout the cell or are concentrated in the central \\npart. The mitotic figures are also lacking. The chlorophyll pigment is bound to photosynthetic \\nlamellae or thylakoids which may be arranged in parallel layers in the periphery of the \\ncytoplasm or form a network extending throughout the cell cytoplasm. They are not \\norganized into grana. The chloroplasts are thus absent and so are the mitochondria, golgi \\nbody and endoplasmic reticulum. The ribosomes are, however, present. The nuclear \\ndivision does not take place by mitosis and no cell plate is formed instead there is a ring \\nlike extension of the cell wall. It extends in wards like a diaphragm with decreasing \\naperture and divides the cell into daughter cells. Such simple cells of blue-green algae \\n(and bacteria) which lack a nuclear membrane, mitochondria, plastids and do not divide \\nby mitosis are called prokaryotic. The cells constituting the thalli of all other algae \\nexcepting the blue green are called eukaryotic. The eukaryotic cell has the same structure \\nas is typical of the higher plants. \\nALGAL FLAGELLA \\nThe motile cells of algae are provided with fine, protoplasmic, whiplike threads, \\nthe flagella. They are extremely fine and hyaline emergencies of the cytoplasm. In cells \\npossessing firm cell walls, the flagella are connected with the inner cytoplasm through \\nsmall pores in the cell wall. There is either a single anterior flagellum (rarely posterior) \\nor the flagella occur in pairs, rarely in great numbers on the cell. The . flagella on the cell \\nmay be equal (isokont) or unequal (heterokont) in length. When the flagella are inserted \\nlaterally one is directed forwards in motion and the other backwards. They function as \\nthe locomotory or propelling structures of the cell. Usually there is a single granule at \\nthe base of each flagellum. It is known as the blepharoplast. \\n(a) Structure of the Flagellum: Forming the Lore of the flagellum is an axial or central \\nfilament called the axoneme. The latter is surrounded by a cytoplasmic membrane or \\nsheath which terminates short of the apex. The naked, terminal portion of the axoneme \\nis called the end piece. The tip of the end piece may be blunt and rounded or pointed. \\nIn cross section the flagellum consists of two inner central simple fibrils forming an elastic \\naxial thread. It is surrounded by nine united, peripheral contractile, thicker protein double \\nfibrils. All are enclosed by sheath which is an extension of the plasma membrane. Each \\nperipheral fibril is composed of two thin fibrils. The two central fibrils are single. They \\nlie side by side and are sometimes enclosed by a sheath of their own. The fibrils are hollow \\nand extend along the entire length of the flagellum. The nine peripheral fibrils join the \\nbasal granule but the two central fibrils stop short of the granule. This \\'9 + 2\\' pattern \\nof component fibrils is the basic structures of the flagellum of all organisms except the \\nbacteria. \\n(b) Kinds of Flagella: They are of two main types, whiplash and tinsel. The whiplash \\nflagellum has a smooth surface. The tinsel flagellum bears longitudinal rows of fine, \\nminute flimmer hairs arranged along the axis almost to the tip of the flagellum. There \\nmay be a single row of hairs as in the Euglenophyta and Pyrrophyta or two as in \\nChrysophyceae and Phaeophyceae. The hairs arise from the margins of the peripheral \\nfibrils. The whiplash or smooth flagella are also known by other names such as acronematic \\nor peitchgeisel. The other names for the tinsel flagella are pantollematic flimmer or flimmergeisel.EUKARYOTA 347 \\nThe use of an electron microscope has revealed a third kind of flagellum it which the \\nsurface of the flagellum is covered by scales (Chara) and minute, short, stiff hairs. Manto \\nand Parke (1960) described this type of flagellum in Micromonas pusilla (Prasinophyceae). \\nThe hairs differ from those on the tinsel type. They can be easily detached. \\n~~II~~~~Eu.rStructural granule \\n~~~:ltKt-- Carboxysomes \\nMucilaginous sheath \\nIII1MfHl.m.;\\';\\'--Gas Vacuoles \\n~rl~::7~~~~::\\':- Nucleoid \\n(A) \\nEye spot --.~~D \\nDeveloping septum \\n\\\\\\\\\\'\\\\\\'r\\'tittt1.l:r Photosynthetic lamel iae \\nibosomes \\nMucilaginous sheath \\nCytoplasm \\n•. ~\\'Il<I\\\\,.-Cell wall \\nVolutin granules \\n\"IF-HII!I\\'fP\\'\\'\\' Thylakoids \\nChloroplast \\nmembrane \\nPyrenoid Starch plate \\n(8) \\nFig. 2 : Fine structure of Prokaryotic (A) and Eukaryotic (B) Cell of a unicellular algae348 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nREPRODUCfION \\nIn their methods of reproduction, the algae are as diverse as they are in the nature \\nof the thallus.

As \\nthis stage resembles an algae Palmella hence this stage is called as Paimella stage. On \\nthe availability of water the contents are released forming either zoospores or aplanospores \\nwhich germinatE: to give rise to a new thallus. \\n(x) Carpospore: Formed in carposporophyte, in members of Rhodophyceae. eg\\xad\\nPolysiphonia.350 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nSEXUAL REPRODUCTION \\nExcept cyanophyceae sexual reproduction occures in all algal members. [when \\ngametes fuse to form zygote] on the basis of organs and their complexity, the following \\nsix types of sexual reproduction are recognized in different groups of algae: \\nI. Autogamy: When two gametes of the same mOL\\'ler cell fuse to form a diploid \\nnucleus, it is called autogamy. In this process there is only fusion of two gametic nuclei \\n(Karyogamy). The autogamy lacks incorporation of external genes (do not show new \\ncharacters) eg - Diatoms \\nII. Hologamy: The vegetative cells of different strains (+) and (-) (female & male) \\nbehave as gametes and fuse to form zygote. More advance- it involves fusion of two cells \\nhaving different genetic constitution ego Unicellular forms (Chlamydomonas) \\nIII. Isogamy: The two gametes which fuse to form zygote, are morphologically and \\nphysiolOgically similar (isogametes). They are usually motile and flagellated. eg- Ulotlzrix, \\nChlamydomonas. \\nIV. Physiological anisogamy: Gametes are similar in morphological characters, they \\nshow physiological variation with (+) and (-) strains. eg - SpirogtJra, Zygnema, Ectocarpus. \\nV. Anisogamy: Gametes are morphologically and physiologically distinct. The male \\nor (microgametes) are smaller and more active, whereas female or macro gametes are larger. \\neg- Chlamydomonas. \\nVI. Oogamy: Advanced type of sexual reproduction. Large non motile egg or ovum \\nfuses with a small motile sperm or antherozoid (in Rhodophyceae, sperm are non motile). \\nEgg is formed with in the oogonium and sperms with in the antheridium. eg- Volvox, \\nOedogolliul1l, Chara, Vallcheria, Sargassllm, Polysiphollia. \\nTYPES OF LIFE CYCLE \\nThe sequence of orderly changes in growth and development of an algae is said \\nto be life cycle. During the process of sexual reproduction gametes fertilize resulting into \\na diploid zygote, this undergoes reduction division and forms haploid plants or it directly \\nforms a diploid plant. A generation is considered as a somatic phase. The alteration of \\ngeneration means a situation in which a plant depicts two somatic phases which regularly \\nalternate during the life cycle i.e. haploid (gametophytic) and diploid (sporophytic). \\n(I) Haplontic Type: Plant is haploid and bears haploid gametes in the gametangium. \\nThe gametic fusion results in the formation of a diploid zygote which is the only diploid \\nphase in the life cycle. The zygote nucleus divides meiotically to produce four meiospores, \\neach of these develops into a new individual. Thus, there is an alternation of a haploid \\nplant with a diploid zygote. eg- Chlamydomollas (unicellular), Ulothrix, Oedogonium, \\nSpirogyra, Zygllema and Chara. \\n(II) Diplontic Type: Diploid plant bears sex organ (gametangia) which are also \\ndiploid. The reduction division takes place at the time of the formation of gametes and \\nas such the gametes are haploid. After gametic fusion diploid stage is re-established in \\nthe form of zygote. The zygote does not undergo any reduction divisipn and it gives rise \\nto a diploid plant body. Thus, there is an alteration of a diploid plant with haploid \\ngametes.eg: Cladophora, SargasS1l11l and DiatomsEUKARYOTA \\n~!

Sporangia develop on the diploid plant body and \\nreduction in the number of chromosomes takes place prior to the formation of zoospores. \\nThe haploid zoospores thus formed grow into haploid plants. Sex organs develop on the \\nhaploid plants and these give rise to haploid gametes.

He divided Algae into seven \\ndivisions, which were further sub divided into classes. The names of divisions and classes \\nare given below: \\nDivision 1: Chlorophyta includes about 5700 forms out of which 90% are fresh water \\nand the remaining 10% are marine. Dominant pigments are chlorophyll a and b, the reserve \\nfood starch. Divided into two classes: (1) Chlorophyceae (green algae) e.g., Volvox, Ulothrix; \\n(2) Charophyceae (stoneworts) e.g., Chara \\nDivision 2: Euglenophyta includes 450 fresh water or terrestrial forms. Dominant \\npigments are chlorophyll and ~ carotene and reserve foods are paramylum and fats. Has \\nbeen divided into a single class Euglenophyceae (the euglenoids) e.g., Euglena \\nDivision 3: Pyrrophyta include 1000 species mainly unicellular rarely colonial. \\nPigments are chlorophyll a & c, carotene and xanthophylls. Reserve foods is starch/ oil. \\nDivided into two classes: (1) Desmophyceae (dinophysids) e.g., Desmarestia; (2) Dinophyceae \\n(Dinoflagelloids) e.g., DillophysisEUKARYOTA 355 \\nDivision 4: Chrysophyta represented by 6000 species of which 75% are freshwater \\nand the remaining 25% marine. Dominant pigments are carotene and xanthophylls and \\nreserve food is leucosin and oil. Divided into three classes: (1) Chrysophyceae (golden \\nbrown algae) e.g, Chromulina; (2) Xanthophyceae (yellow green algae) e.g., Botnjdium; (3) \\nBacillariophyceae (diatoms) e.g., Pinnularia. \\nDivision 5: Phaeophyta (Brown algae) represented by 1000 mostly marine forms, \\ndominant pigments are phycophyein and fucoxanthin and reserve foods are laminarin \\nand mannitol. Divided into three classes: (1) Isogeneratae ego Ectocarpus (2) Hetergeneratae \\ne.g. Myrionema and (3) Cyclosporae e.g., Sargassllm. \\nDivision 6: Cyanophyta (Blue green algae). Represented by 1500 mostly fresh water \\nspecies pigments are chlorophyll a & b, C-phycocyanin and C-phycoerythrin and the. \\nreserve food is cyanophycean starch. Motile cells absent. Divided into a single class \\nMyxophyceae ego Nostoc, Anabaena. \\nDivision 7: Rhodophyta (Red Algae) includes 2500 species mostly marine. \\nPredominant pigments are r-phycoerythrin.

The scheme proposed by him is as follows: \\nPhylum I Chlorophyta: Eukaryotic algae with chloroplasts surrounded by one \\nmembrane of chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum. \\nClasses (i) Chlorophyceae \\n(ii) Charophyceae \\nPhylum II Euglenophyta: Chlorophyll a and b, storage product paramylon. \\nPhylum III Chrysophyta-Chl. a and xanthophylls (golden brown algae) \\nClasses (i) Chrysophyceae \\n(ii) Bacillariophyceae \\n(iii) Heterokontae (xanthophyceae) \\nPhylum IV Pyrrophyta: mesokaryotic nucleus, chI a and c. \\nClasses (i) Desmokontae (Desmophyceae) \\n(ii) Dinokontae (Dinophyceae) \\nPhylum V Phaeophyta: ChI a and c, fucoxanthin, storage product chrysolaminarin \\noccurring in vesicles in cytoplasm. \\nClasses (i) Isogeneratae \\n(ii) Heterogeneratae \\n(iii) Cyclosporeae \\nPhylum VI Rhodophyta: ChI a and b, phycobiliproteins, storage product -floridian \\nstarch. \\nClasses (i) Bangioideae \\n(ii) Florideae \\nPhylum VII Cyanophyta - ChI a, phycobiliproteins \\nClasses (i) Coccogoneae \\n(ii) Hormogoneae \\nPhylum VIII Cryptophyta- ChI a and c, starch is reserve food. \\nPhylum IX Chloromonadophyta \\nTHE FUNGI \\nOnce, fungi and bacteria were considered parts of the plant kingdom, primarily \\nbecause they produce spores, have cells walls and obviously are not animals. Now it has \\nbecome clear that the organisms grouped together as fungi are definitely not plants. \\nThe name of the fungi is derived from their most obvious representatives, the \\nmushrooms (Greek, mykes, latin, fungus). They are eukaryotes and share with plants the \\npossession of a cell wall, liquid-filled intracellular vacuoles, microscopically visible \\nstreaming of the cytoplasm and (almost universal) lack of motility. However, they do notEUKARYOTA 357 \\ncontain photosynthetic pigments and are chemo-organoheterotrophs. Most grow aerobically \\nand obtain their energy by oxidation of organic substances. Compared to the plants, which \\nare organized into stems, roots and leaves, fungi show only very limited morphological \\ndifferentiation and practically no functional differentiation. \\nClassification of Fungi and Related Organisms \\nKingdom - Myceteae \\nDivision - Myxomycota - Slime molds \\nDivision Eumycota - True fungi \\nSub division Mastigomycotina - Fungi with motile cells \\nClass - Chytridiomycetes \\nClass - Hyphochytridiomycetes \\nClass - Oomycetes \\nSub division Zygomycotina - Fungi with zygospores \\nSub diviSion Ascomycotina - Fungi with asci \\nSub division Basidiomycotina - Fungi with basidia \\nSub division Deuteromycotina - Fungi without known sexual stages \\nGeneral Characteristics of Fungi \\nFungi constitute a large group of organisms, although about 100,000 species have \\nbeen named, 200,000 more species are estimated to remain undiscovered. Like insects and \\norchids, fungi are quite possibly speciating rapidly than they are being discovered. \\nThe Vegetative body: The vegetative body is a thallus. It consists of filaments about \\n5 ~m in diameter which are multiply branched and spread over or into the nutrient \\nmedium. The filaments or hyphae consist of a cell wall and cytoplasm with its inclusions. \\nThe hyphae may be without cross walls (in the lower fungi) or divided into cells by septa \\nin the higher fungi. However, even in the septate hyphae, the cytoplasm of the cells is \\ncontinuous via a central pore in the septum. The total of the hyphal mass of a fungal \\nthallus is called the mycelium. In certain stages, often during transition to the sexual or \\nasexual reproduction phase, the mycelium forms tissue like aggreagates, the so-called \\nplectenchyma. A typical plectenchyma is the \\'flesh\\' of the mushroom. In the higher fungi, \\nthe mycelium may also form thick strands, rhizomorphs, which function to transport \\nnutrients. \\nNutrition \\nA universal characteristic of fungi is that they are completely heterotrophic; no trace \\nof photosynthesis is found in any stage of any group. However, because they have walls, \\nfungi cannot engulf food as animals do; instead, fungi must obtain nutrients from the \\nenvironment from living, dying or dead organisms. On this basis, fungi are subdivided \\ninto three types: (1) biotrophs (parasites), which draw nutrients slowly from living hosts,358 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\noften without killing them; (2) necrotrophs, which attack living hosts so virulently that \\nthey kill the hosts and then absorb released nutrients. (3) saprotrophs, fungi that attack \\norganisms after they have died from other causes. \\nMany biotrophs secrete chemicals that cause the host cell membrane to become \\nunusually permeable to sugars or amino acids, as they leak from the host cell, the fungus \\nabsorbs them. In sophisticated parasites, damage to the host cell is so slight that the plant \\nresponds as though the fungus were a normal sink for metabolities, and extra sugars and \\namino acids are actually trai1sported by the plant from other leaves to the site of infection, \\njust as though the fungus were a developing fruit or other plant part. In biotrophic attacks, \\nfungal cells may remain confined solely to intercellular spaces; in other species; the fungus \\ncreates a small hole in the plant cell wall, then inserts a small portion, the haustorium, \\nof its filamentous cell through the hole. The haustorium is in close contact with the plant \\ncell plasma membrane, which probably makes it easier to absorb nutrients. \\nExtracellular Digestion: Natural release of sugars may be sufficient for the fungi, \\nbut typically they secrete digestive enzymes that attack host polymers, converting them \\nto sugars, amino acids, and lipids tllat can be absorbed. Saprotrophs depend predominantly \\non this form of extracellular digestion, and many depolymerize and consume cellulose \\n(brown rot fungi), hemicelluloses, and even lignin (white rot fungi). The ability either to \\nabsorb host-produced monomers or to secrete extracellular digestive enzymes is often both \\nspecies specific and tissue specific. Many biotrophic and saprotrophic fungi can attack \\nsuccessfully only a few or just one host species, or even just a single variety of one plant \\nspecies. Many fungi are even tissue specific: Wilt-inducing fusariums must invade xylem \\nand attack xylary middle lamellas; they cannot survive in cortex, pith, or phloem even \\nthough those cells are rich in free monomers. Fungi transmitted by aphids and other \\nphloem-sucking insects usually are able to attack only phloem: their toxins and extracellular \\nenzymes are not effective against other tissues. \\nGrowth and reproduction: Fungal hyphae elongate at their apices (apical growth). \\nIn most fungi every part of the mycelium has the potential for growth (elongation); a small \\npiece of mycelium is sufficient for inoculation to produce a new thallus. However, the \\nforms and mechanisms involved in the reproduction of fungi are extremely diverse and \\nare used as the basis for classification. Two kinds of reproduction are distinguished, \\nnamely sexual and asexual. Most fungi can reproduce in both ways. A universal character \\nof fungi is their formation of spores, resistant resting stages that are the primarily means \\nof reproduction, dispersal and survival, spores are produced either asexually or sexually. \\nAsexual reproduction of fungi is mostly by budding, fragmentation, or formation \\nof spores. Spore formation is the most widely distributed and most highly differentiated \\nmethod. Conidiospores are budded off at hyphal apices (in Penicillillm, Aspergilllls). When \\nthese arise inside sporangia (i.e. receptacles), the fungi are grouped as sporangiospores \\n(Mucor, Rhizopus). In the lower fungi, sporangia are often motile by means of flagella and \\nare called zoospores. The flagella conform to the typical eukaryotic model: they originate \\nfrom a blepharoplast in the cytoplasm and consist of eleven parallel fibrils of which nine \\nperipheral fibrils are arranged concentrically around two central ones (9 +2). \\nThe asexual reproduction characteristic of yeasts (budding fungi) is budding; theEUKARYOTA 359 \\nmother cell forms an out growth which receives a daughter nucleus, where upon the \\nnucleated out growth is pinched off as a \\'bud\\'. Asexual reproduction can also occur by \\nfragmentation of the hyphae into single cells, the oidia or arthrospores (e.g. in the milk \\nmould Endomyces Iactis). In some fungi these cells are surrounded by a thick wall and \\nare referred to as chlamydospores. Finally, there are some yeasts (Sclzizosaccharomyces) \\nwhich reproduce by binary fission in a manner similar to bacteria. \\nA \\n~Rhizoidal \\n,y f,/ yHyphae \\no \\nIter \\ncellular \\nhypha \\n~ \\nHaustorium \\nEctophytic hypha Ectophytic hypha \\nHaustorium \\nlGia ~ p~~ E ~nlF \\nHaustorium \\nFig. 3 : Modes of Nutrition \\nSclerotia (Sing: sclerotium) are more elaborate and even more resistant; they develop \\nas a section of mycelium branches profusely and the hyphae attract each other, forming \\na compact aggregate. The outermost hyphae are swollen and globose and have thick \\nmelanized walls. The inner mass consists of large hyphae (filled with nutrients such as \\noil, glycogen, mannitol, and trehalose) and small, thin-walled hyphae (rich in cytoplasm \\nand organelles). Rather than remaining distinct, the hyphae undergo numerous fusions \\nwith each other, forming a highly interconnected mass. Large amounts of mucilage are \\nsecreted around the hyphae, which seems to act as a water-holding substance. Sclerotia \\nare often formed by biotrophic fungi, and their germination frequently depends not merely \\non good conditions but on conditions favorable for the host as well. The sclerotia of360 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nSclerotium cepivorum germinate only when a host root happens to grow next to it, and \\nthose of Claviceps germinate in the spring, just when the host grasses are starting to \\nproduce flowers. \\nSexual reproduction: This, as in all other eukaryotes, comprises the union or \\nconjugation of two nuclei. In different fungi, the nuclear fusion may occur at different \\nintervals after the first parental contact. Sexual reproduction can usually be divided into \\nthree phases. \\nPlasmogamy, the fusion of two protoplasts. The resulting cell has two nuclei. This \\nnuclear pair or dikaryon does not need to fuse immediately, but it can persist in the \\ndikaryotic state during the rest of the cell division, the two nuclei dividing simultaneously \\n(conjugative division). The fusion of the two haploid nuclei (karyogamy) may occur later, \\noften only after formation of a fruiting body, to give the diploid nucleus of the zygote. \\nFollowing karyogamy, meiosis, the reduction division of the chromosomes to the haploid \\nnumber, takes place. These three processes or stages, plasmogamy, karyogamy, and \\nmeiosis, may occur in immediate sequence in some fungi, but in others they can occur \\nduring quite different stages of development. \\nIn the lower fungi the phase of sexual reproduction is initiated by the formation \\nof gametes, i.e. sexual cells. When the gametes formed by the male and female parental \\ncells are ipdistinguishable morphologically they are called isogametes. The gametes are \\noften formed inside morphologically differentiated cells, which are called gametangia, and \\nwhen these are morphologically distinct, the male gametangia are called antheridia and \\nthe female ones are called oogonia. \\nThe ways in which the gametes are transferred and plasmogamy achieved can again \\nbe sub divided into various kinds. In lower fungi, especially in aquatic ones, both gametes \\nare usually motile (planogametes) and fuse outside the gametangia (i.e. after liberation \\nfrom the gametangia). In the oomycetes only the male gamete is motile; it penetrates the \\noogonium and fertilizes the ovum. Zygomycetes are characterized by gametangiogamy, \\nthe fusion of whole, multinucleate gametangia into a coenozygote. \\nWhen the male and female gametangia originate from the same vegetative body \\n(produced from a single spore), the organism is referred to as a homothallic or hermaphrodite \\nfungus (monozoic). In heterothallic, or dizoic, fungi the thalli are either male or female, \\nthat is, they bear only male or female sex organs. Homothallic fungi can be self-fertilising \\n(autogamous). However, in some homothallic fungi no self-fertilisation occurs due to some \\nphysiological inhibitory mechanism, which is referred to as incompatibility. This is the \\ncase in Neurospora, for example, which, though homothallic, needs conjugation between \\nmembers of different types (+ and - ) to establish fertilization, individuals belonging to \\nthe same type are incompatible. \\nClassification \\nThe classification of fungi, like that of bacteria, is designed mainly for practical \\napplication but it also bears some relation to phylogenetic considerations. The nomenclature \\nis binomial, with a generic and a specific name (eg: Aspergillus lliger). Species are collected \\nin genera, genera in families (suffix -aceae), families in orders (suffix-ales), and ordersEUKARYOTA 361 \\nin classes (suffix-mycetes). The division of mycota, or fungi and moulds, includes the true \\nslime moulds (Myxomycetes), the lower fungi (Phycomycetes), and the higher fungi \\n(Eumycetes). \\nAlexopolous and Mims proposed fungal classification in 1979. They place the fungi \\nincluding the slime molds in the kingdom mycetae of the super kingdom Eukaryota which, \\nin addition, includes four other kingdoms. They divide the kingdom mycetae into three \\ndivisions namely: 1. Gymnomycota 2. Mastigomycota and 3. Amastigomycota. The division \\nis sub divided into subdivision, classes, sub-classes and orders. \\nDivision I Gymnomycota \\nIt includes phagotrophic organism devoid of cell walls.

They \\nare heterotrophic and form spores, but they lack walls and have a unique body \\norganization. In true slime molds, the body is a large mass of protoplasm (slime) with \\na volume of several cubic centimeters containing thousands or millions of nuclei, all in \\nthe same cytoplasm and covered only by a plasma membrane. This mass of protoplasm, \\ncalled a plasmodium (pI: plasmodia), is capable of migrating over a substrate, much like \\nan amoeba, but is so large that it is easily visible to the naked eye. The plasmodium digests \\nmaterial from the substrate as it moves along; bacteria; yeasts, and decayed plant material364 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nare the most common nutrients and are engulfed just as bacteria are engulfed by an \\namoeba. Such consumption of particulate matter is not possible in true fungi because of \\ntheir rigid cell walls. \\nThe slime molds are of two types, acellular and cellular. The somatic phase in the \\nformer is called the plasmodium. It is a free living, multinucleate, apparently naked \\nprotoplasmic mass. It is holocarpic. The somatic phase in the cellular slime molds is termed \\nthe pseudoplasmodium. \\nIn response to environmental cues, a plasmodium aggregates its protoplasm, forming \\none or several mounds; it then extends upward, producing sporangia on stalks. Spores \\nwith true walls are formed and released; the spores are extremely resistant, surviving for \\nmany years even under adverse conditions. Meiosis occurs after the spores form; then \\nthree nuclei degenerate. Upon germination, the spores may release either an amoeboid \\nor a flagellated cell, and the two forms are interconvertible. The cell grows and may \\nundergo both nuclear and cellular division proliferating into a population of haploid cells. \\nEach cell contains mating type factors, and when two compatible cells meet, they fuse \\ninto one mass, mixing the two types of nuclei. Fusion is not limited to two cells; many \\ncells may fuse, resulting in a multi-nucleate plasmodium. Karyogamy occurs shortly \\nthereafter, and nuclei are then diploid. The plasmodium continues to migrate and feed \\nuntil induced to undergo another round of spore formation. \\nThe phylogenetic-evolutionary - relationships of slime molds to other organisms \\nare not known. They may represent a surviving line of evolution which originated not \\nlong after eukaryotes arose and which has changed little since. It is also possible that \\nsome are extremely reduced forms that evolved from more advanced organisms. Uncertainly \\nabout their evolutionary position is compounded because other groups-cellular slime \\nmolds, protostelids and net slime molds have other combinations of fungal and non fungal \\ncharacters. \\nThe characteristic features of Myxomycetes: \\n1. The somatic phase is represented by a multinucleate apparently naked acellular \\nslimy protoplasmic mass called plasmodium. \\n2. The plasmodium is the product of syngamy (Diploid). \\n3. The diploid plasmodium is holocarpic, free living and active. It contain and \\nsecretes slime. \\n4. Normally at the fruiting time, the entire plasmodium is organized into one or \\nmore plant like reproductive structures, the sporangia (sporophores) or under \\nconditions of stress and strains it becomes converted into\\' an irregular hard \\nstructure, the sclerotium. \\n5. The sporangium generally develops a tough non-cellular layer or wall called \\nthe peridium which is often studded with tiny crystals of calcium salts. \\n6. Within the peridium is usually an intricate network of fine tube-like structures \\nconstituting the capillitium.EUKARYOTA 365 \\nGermination Myxamoebae \\nspore-------II \\n/ \\n\" Swarm ~ cells ~ 2> .....

The numerous spores are differentiated from the diploid protoplast of the \\nsporangium by meiosis. \\n8. The encapsulated haploid spores or meiospores are close packed between the \\nfine tubes of the capitllitium but are free from them when mature. \\n9. The spore wall is differentiated into two layers, the outer of which is sculptured \\nor spiny. \\n10. On germination, the haploid spores or meiospore give rise either to myxamoebae \\nor bifagellate swarm cells which function as gametes. \\n11. The swarm cells or myxamoebae do not produce slime. \\n12. The sporangium in Physarum thus functions as an organ of sexual reproduction. \\n13. Sexual reproduction is of isogamous type. \\n14. The diploid zygote, by repeated mitoses but no cytokinesis, directly gives rise \\nto multinucleate plasmodium. \\nThe term Plasmodium is used for a molded object which is multinucleate surrounded \\nby plasma membrane and a gelatinuous slime sheath with fibrils in it.366 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nSomatic Phase: The creeping multinucleate apparently naked plasmodium which \\nrepresents the somatic or assimilative phase in the life cycle of myxomycetes, varies in \\nstructure in the different species. Alexopoulos (1960) by described three types namely \\nprotoplasmodium, aphanoplamodium and phaneroplasmodium. \\n1. Protoplasmodium: The plasmodium in some myxomycetes (order Echinosteliales) \\nis simple and of a primitive type. It is a uninucleate tiny mass of nearly homogenous \\nslimy protoplasm which form pseudopode but shows no distinction into veins. It is the \\nsmallest among the myxomycetes and remains microscopic as long as it exists. The \\ncytoplasmic stream is indistinct, slow and irregular. At the fruiting time it gets converted \\ninto a single sporangium. \\n2. Aphanoplasmodium: This type of plasmodium is characteristic of the order \\nstemonitomycetales. Early in its development the aphanoplasmodium looks very much \\nlike a protoplasmodium. During further growth it elongates and branches, finally resulting \\nin a network of delicate strands. The aphanoplasmodium lacks the slimy sheath. The \\nplasmodial protoplasm is less granular and tl1US transparent and not easily visible. The \\ndistinction into ectoplasm and endoplasm in not conspicuous. The cytoplasmic streaming \\nis, however, rapid and confined by a fine membrane. \\n3. Phaneroplasmodium: It is the most common type and characteristic of the order \\nphysarales. The mature phaneroplasmodium is a massive structure. In its initial stages \\nof development it is very much like the proloplasmodium. The multinucleate slimy \\nprotoplasm of the phaneroplasmodium is highly granular. It is differentiated into \\nectoplasm and endoplasm. At maturity it is divisible into an anterior fan-shaped perforated \\nsheet of protoplasm and posterior zone consisting of a reticulate network of tubular veins \\nor strands in which flows the rapid endoplasmic stream. \\nSclerotium formation: Under conditions of stress and strain, the phaneroplasmodium \\nbecomes converted into an irregular hardened mass of thick-walled cellular units. It is \\ntermed the sclerotium. \\nThe polynucleate thick-walled units constituting the sclerotium are termed spherules. \\nThe sclerotia and spherules remain dormant under conditions unfavourable for vegetative \\ngrowth. With the return of conditions suitable for growth, the sclerodium germinates to \\ngive rise to a new plasmodium. \\nReproductive phase: Normally on reaching a certain stage of maturity, the \\nMyxomycete plasmodium passes into the reproductive stage. During this stage the entire \\nplasmodium becomes converted into one or more fruit-like bodies, the sporophores or \\nsphororigia which bear the spores. This process is termed sporulation. The latter bear \\nspores within sporophores. The sporophores in the endosporus Myxomycetes chiefly are \\nof three types namely sporangia, aethalia and plasmodiocarps. \\nSporangia: Most of the endosporous Myxomycetes (order physarales) produce fruit \\nbodies of this type. At the fruiting time the planeroplasmodium becomes converted into \\na group of several stalked, sometimes sessile sac-like structures, the sporangia. The \\nsporangia in the group remain separate from one another. However, they arise in close \\nproximity from a common thin transparent cellophane like base called the hypothallus.EUKARYOTA 367 \\nThe latter is secreted and deposited during conversion of the plasmodium on the portion \\nof the substratum formerly occupied by it. In some cases the hypothallus is absent. \\nExamples are Aretjria, Physarum, Trichia, Didymium and others. \\nD \\nFig. 5 : Different types of sporangia in slime molds: A. Arcyria, B. Steomonitis; C. \\nComatricha; D. Didymium; E. Physanmr \\nAethalia: Aethalium type of fruit body is characteristic of Lycogala and Fuligo. The \\nplasmodium, at the fruiting time is fairly large structure. It becomes converted into a group \\nof saclike sporangia that do not separate from one another. The entire fructification which \\nis termed aethalium, is enclosed in a common peridium and share a common hypothallus. \\nThe sporangia! walls in the aggregation may be distinct, hardly visible or not present \\nat all. \\nPlasmodiocarp: In forms like Hemitrichia the fruit body is very much like a sessile \\nsporangium that retains the shape of the plasmodial venation. This type of sporophore \\nis called a plasmodiocarp. It is formed by the concentration of the plasmodial protoplasm \\naround some of the main veins followed by the development of peridium around cell. \\nA typical sporophore or sporangium consists of six parts namely hypothallus, stalk; \\nperidium, columella, capillitium and spores. All the sporophores produce spores but may \\nor may not have all the other five parts. Generally the spores are globose in form and \\nhave a thick cell wall which is usually sculptured and rarely smooth. The mature spores \\nare uninucleate and haploid. Meiosis occurs in the spores when young. \\nClassification: Macbridge (1899) was the first to use the term myxomycetes. It is \\ngroup of organism having delicate structure and brilliant colours. They exist in non-green \\nslimy masses of protoplasm sending out pseudopodia. They are found in cold, moist shady \\nplaces in dead organic matter such as decaying logs and fallen dead leaves in the woods. \\nThe class include the true plasmodial acellular slime molds most of which produce \\npigmented spores in small, delicate sporangia. The class myxomycetes is often divided \\ninto the following three sub classes:368 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(i) Ceratiomyxomycetidae: It contains a single order ceratiomyxales represented by \\na single family ceratiomyxaceae. Ceratiomyxa with three exosporus species is the only \\ngenus included in this family. \\n(ii) Stemonitomycetidae: It includes a single order stemonitales which comprises \\nonly one family stemonitaceae. It is endosporous. The somatic phase is of \\naphanoplasmodium type. \\n(iii) Myxogastromycetidae: It comprises four orders namely Physarales, Siceales, \\nEchinosteliales and Trichiales. All are endosporous. The somatic phase is usually of \\nprotoplasmodial or phaneroplasmodial type. The class myxomycetes thus contains six \\norders. Of these Physarales belonging to the sub class myxogastromycetidae is the most \\nimportant. \\nSystematic Position of Slime Molds \\n• Members are regarded by many mycologist as parasitic II slime molds\". However \\nGauman (1926), Bessey (1962), Alexopoulus (1962) included these among the \\ntrue fungi. \\n• In recent years the controversy has been revitalized by inclusion of \\nplasmodiophoromycetes as a class of myxomycotina (Ainsworth 1966, 1973). \\n• Klein and Cronquist (1967) suggest that Woronina and Polymyxa should be \\nseparated from plasmodiophorales because of their cellulosic cell wall and \\nzoospore structures. \\n• Though this group has been included under mastigomycotina we do it with \\nfull realization that these organism have no clear cut affinities with any group. \\nThey are neither true slime molds nor true fungi. The Plasmodium and heterokant \\nzoospores are characters that relate these organism to slime molds but the \\ndifferences are many: \\n(a) Plasmodium in slime molds is free living while obligately parasite in these \\norganism. \\n(b) Presence of zoosporangia and resting spores which are not formed by myxomycetes. \\n(c) Presence of golgi bodies in the Plasmodium and in the zoospore relates to \\nPlasmodiophorales with Mastigomycotina. Myxomycetes lack golgi bodies. \\n(d) Wall is made up of chitin and not cellulose. In myxomycetes the wall of the \\nspores are made up of cellulose. \\nUntil more is known about the site of karyogamy, meiosis and life cycle of these \\norganisms any judgment on their relationship will be only half baked and unprofitable. \\nTHE PROTOZOA \\nThe sub kingdom Protozoa which was originally included in the kingdom protista \\nincludes unicellular, non photosynthetic, eukaryotic microorganism that are considered \\nsingle celled, The Protozoan Animals. \\nThe Protozoa may be defined as \\'microscopic, acellular animalcules existing singlyEUKARYOTA 369 \\nor in colonies without tissues and organs, having one or more nuclei. When in colonies, \\nthey differ form metazoa in having all the individuals alike except those engaged in \\nreproductive activities\\'. \\nGeneral Characters \\nSize \\n1. The protozoans are small, generally microscopic animalcules. \\n2. Simplest & primitive of all animals with very simple body organisation, i.e. \\nprotoplasmic grade of organisation. \\n3. Acellular, animals, without tissues & organs. \\n4. Body naked or covered by pellicle but in some forms body is covered with shells \\nand often provided with internal skeleton. \\n5. Protozoans are solitary or colonial; in colonial forms the individuals are alike \\nand independent. \\n6. Body shape variable; it may be spherical; oval, elongated or flattened. \\n7. Body protoplasm is differentiated into an outer ectoplasm and inner endoplasm. \\n8. Protozoans may have one or more nuclei; nuclei may be monomorphic or \\ndimorphic, vesicular or massive. Vesicular nuclei are commonly spherical, oval \\nor biconvex, consist of a central body, the endosome (nucleolus) encircled by \\na zone of nuclear sap. \\n9. Locomotory organelles are pseudopodia, flagella, cilia or none. \\n10. Nutrition may be holozoic (animal-like), holophytic (plant-like), saprozoic or \\nparasitic. Digestion intracellular, takes place inside the food vacuoles. \\n11. Respiration occurs by diffusion through general body surface. \\n12. Excretion occurs through general body surface but in some forms through a \\ntemporary opening in the ectoplasm or through a permanent pore, the cytopyge. \\n13. Contractile vacuoles perform osmoregulation in fresh water forms & also help \\nin removing excretory products. \\n14. Reproduction asexual or sexual; asexual reproduction occurs by binary fission, \\nmultiple fission, budding or sporulation and sexual reproduction is performed \\nby gamete formation or conjugation. \\n15. Life cycle often exhibits alternation of generation, i.e. it includes asexual and \\nsexual phases. \\n16. Encystment usually occurs to tide over the unfavourable conditions and it also \\nhelps in dispersal. \\n17. The protozoans exhibit mainly two modes of life, free-living inhabiting fresh \\nwater, salt-water and damp places, and parasitic living as ectb & endoparasities. \\nThey are also commercial in habit. \\nThe Protozoa are usually microscopic and not visible to the naked eyes. Their size370 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nvaries from 2 microns to 250 microns (one micron (11) is equal to 1/1000 mm or 0.001 \\nmm). Babesia, Leishmania and Plasmodium are the smallest protozoans known so far. Some \\nof the larger protozoa, like Amoeba and Paramedum, can be seen with naked eyes, \\n. Spirostomum, a ciliate, grows to 3 mm long. Pelomyxa, a giant amoeba, attains a diameter \\nof about 1 to 5 mm. Porospora gigantea, a sporozoa, grows to about 16 mm long. Cycloclypeus, \\na foraminifera, exceeds a diameter of about 50 mm and some shelled marine protozoans \\nhave diameters of about 63 mm. \\nShape \\nProtozoa, the most primitive of all organisms, exhibit nearly all types of body shape. \\nThe body shape of a protozoa is definite but it may usually vary within narrow limits. \\nThe body shape is usually determined by the consistency of cytoplasm, limiting membranes \\nof the body, shells & skeleton. Amoeba has an irregular, asymmetrical body shape because \\nof the absence of rigid body envelope. However, the floating forms usually possess \\nspherical body shape like Noctiluca; the body shape is usually elongated in active \\nswimmers like Euglena and Paramedum, the body shape may be flattened in creeping forms \\nlike OXljtricha. Shells and tests like those of Difflugia and Arcella determine the shape of \\nthese species. It may be funnel-shaped like stentor, bell-shaped like Vorticella and so on. \\nSome of the protozoans like Radiolarians exhibit spherical symmetry and attached species \\nlike Vorticella exhibit more or less radial symmetry. \\nBody Envelope & Skeleton \\nThese protect them from external environmental hazards. The body envelope, being \\nselective in nature, allows exchange of substances across it and helps in perceiving various \\ntypes of stimuli. However, the body envelope, in protozoans, may be either plasmalemma \\nor pellicle. In some species like Amoeba proteus, the body envelope is a thin plasma \\nmembrane or plasmalemma which is mucopolysaccharide in nature. It helps in adhesion \\nto the substratum and in the exchange of various materials. The pellicle is comparatively \\nthicker, tough, elastic and porteinous in nature, it helps in maintaining the general shape \\nof the protozoans and performs the usual functions. \\nThe skeletal layers are secreted in still other protozoans in which their protoplasmic \\nbody remains protected. These include (a) cyst, (b) theca, (c) lorica and (d) test or shell. \\nIt is primarily secreted during unfavourable conditions. The encysted individuals \\ncomfortably tide over the environmental hazards. The theca is another skeletal layer found \\nin many dinoflagellates like Ceratium & Glenodinium. It is a coat of closely-fitted armour \\nof cellulose, comparable to the thick cell walls of higher plants. The lorica, in majority \\nof dinoflagellates, in differentiated into a number of plates arranged into a definite pattern; \\nbut in some forms, it may be formed of two valves. The lorica is still another skeletal \\nlayer found in certain protozoans like Salpingoeca, Monosiga, Dinobnjon, Synura splendida \\nand Poteriodendron, etc. It is a coat of less-closely fitted armour of protozoans than the \\ntheca. The lorica is usually vase-shaped or tubular having an opening for the emergence \\nof the anterior part of the animal or its appendages. The base of the lorica is either attached \\ndirectly to the substratum (in sessile individuals .like Salipingoeca) or it may terminate inEUKARYOTA 371 \\na stalk like Monosiga. In colonial loricated protozoans, one lorica may be attached to \\nanother lorica directly as in Dinobryon or one lorica may attached to another lorica by \\na stalk as in Poteriodendron. The shells or tests are still other skeletal layer of protozoans; \\nthese are of common occurrence. There are loose armour with one or more openings over \\nthe body of protozoans like Arcella, Difflugia, etc. In Arcella the shell is thin and composed \\nof pseduochitin (proteins plus carbohydrates) and ventrally it has an aperture from which \\n3 or 4 pseudopodia project out. In Diffugia the shell is made of sand and other foreign \\nsubstances like fragments of foraminiferan\\'s shell and sponge spicules. These foreign \\nsubstances get embedded in a secreted matrix by the animal, working like cement, to form \\nthe shell. \\nTheradiolarian\\'s shells are internal skeletal layer lying between ectoplasm and \\nendoplasm. It forms a central capsule, which is composed of pseudochitin or silica or \\nstrontium sulphate and secreted by the cytoplasm. The central capsule is perforated by one \\nto many pores through which the extra-capsular cytoplasm extends out as fine pseudopodia. \\nPellicle \\nA \\nB \\nE shell of \\npseudochitin \\nJ K \\nSiliceous \\nshell \\no \\nFig. 6 : Various types of skeletons in protozoa.

Helmet-shaped radiolarian skeleton372 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nCytoplasm \\nThe cytoplasm of protozoa is generally colorless but certain coloured species are \\nalso found; Blepharisma lateritia is rose-red and Stentor coeruleus is blue. The cytoplasm \\nis commonly divided into peripheral clear ectoplasm and inner granular endoplasm. These \\ntwo may change from one to the other as is reported in Amoeba proteus. The cytoplasm \\ncontains various organelles like mitochondria, golgi bodies, endoplasmic reticulum, \\nribosomes, lysosomes, centrioles, microtubules, plastids, etc. \\nNucleus \\nThe nuclei of Protozoa exhibit a greater variety of size, shape and structure than \\nthe nuclei of Metazoa. The nucleus of Protozoa has a nuclear membrane, nUcleoplasm, \\noxychromatin, basichromatin, and there may be a nucleolus. The nuclear membrane \\nremains intact even in cell division. There are various kinds of nuclei in protozoa 1. \\nVesicular nucleus has a large amount of nuceloplasm, the chromatin is small in quantity \\nand it forms small granules, the achromatin (oxychromatin) is more fluid and its network, \\nif present, is coarse, there is a round endosome of basichromatin or oxychromatin, or of \\nboth e.g, Euglena, Arcella, Entamoeba 2. Massive or computer nucleus has a small amount \\nof nucleoplasm, there is a large amount of chromatin forming evenly scattered small \\ngranules, the achromatin is viscid forming a fine network, eg., Amoeba. In the majority \\nof protozoa the nuclei show a structure intermediate between the vesicular and massive \\nnuclei. 3 polyenergid nucleus has several sets of chromosomes, instead of one set inside \\nthe nuclear membrane, this is due to mitosis occurring repeatedly \\'inside the nuclear \\nmembrane. But the sets of chromosomes are finally liberated and each forms a new nucleus. \\nThe polyenergid condition is a provision for spore formation, eg., Radiolaria. \\nLocomotion \\nThe Protozoa perform locomotion or movement by various organelles; pseudopodia \\ncharacteristic of Sarcodina, flagella characteristic of flagellate (Mastigophora), cilia \\ncharacteristics of Ciliata and other contractile structures of pellicle, myonemes, characteristic \\nof Sporozoa and few others. The seat of locomotion lies in the ectoplasm, since locomotor \\norganelles either arise from it or are present in it. \\n(A) Pseudopodia: Pseudopodia are generally temporary out growths of protoplasm \\nfrom any part of the body, they are found in those protozoa which are \\'naked\\' or have \\na very thin pellicle. Pseudopodia may be of ectoplasm or they may also have a core of \\nendoplasm. Following kinds of pseudopodia are found. \\n(i) Lobopodia are blunt, short or finger-like, they are made of ectoplasm with a core \\nof fluid endoplasm, e.g. Arcella & Amoeba. \\n(ii) Filopodia are fine, long threads, often with rounded ends, at times they may \\nbranch, they are made of only hyaline ectoplasm, ego A radiosa-Radiolaria. \\n(iii) Rhizopodia or reticulopodia are thin, long and branching, the branches of \\nadjacent pseudopodia may anastomose to form a network which also serves as a trap \\nfor capturing food, ego Elphidium.EUKARYOTA 373 \\n(iv) Axopodia are long, stiff threads made of ectoplasm, with a hard central axial \\nfilament of endoplasm, unlike others they are semi-permanent, ego ActinophnJs, Axopodia \\nare not organelles of locomotion but are only for capturing food. \\nFig. 7 : Types of pseudopodia. L. Lobopodia of Amoeba; B. Filopodia of Euglypha; C. \\nReticulopodia of Globigeri1la D. Axopodia of Acti1lopltnjs \\n(B) Flagella: Flagella are extremely fine fibres having a central axoneme made of \\ntwo longitudinal fibrils, and an enveloping protoplasmic sheath having nine double \\nlongitudinal fibrils forming a ring. All 20 fibrils lie in a matrix of dense cytoplasm and \\nthey fuse at the base to join a basal granule or kinetosome. The kinetosome may be joined \\nto the nucleus by a rhizoplast. The basal granule is often synonymous with a centriole \\nbecause it initiates nuclear divisions, if it does not act as a centriole then it is connected \\nby a rhizoplast to a centriole or to the nucleus. At the tip of the main flagellum may be \\na very fine and piece or mastigoneme, or the main axis of the flagellum may bear fine, \\nflexible lateral processes or mastigonemes on one side or on both sides. Mastigonemes \\nconstitute the so-called flimmer or ciliary flagellum. Flagella are recognized to be of the \\nfollowing types depending upon the arrangement of mastigonemes in them: \\n(i) Stichonematic: When the mastigonemes are present on one side of the flagellum; \\nit is called stichonematic flagellum. Eg., Flagellum of Eugle1la. \\n(ii) Pantonematic: When the mastigonemes are present in two or more rows arranged \\non both the sides of the flagellum, it is called pantonematic, eg., Flagellum of Paranema. \\n(iii) Acronematic: When the mastigonemes are absent and the distal end of the \\nflagellum ends in a terminal filament. Eg., flagellum of Chlamydomonas.374 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n(iv) Pentachronematic: When the mastigonemes are present in two rows on the \\nlateral sides of the flagellum but the flagellum ends in terminal filament, eg., Flagellum \\nof Urcoelus. \\n(v) In some cases, the flagellum is simple without mastigonemes and/ or terminal \\nfilament, Chilomonas, CnJPtomonas. \\n(C) Cilia: Cilia are exactly like flagella in structure and there is no real distinction \\nbetween them, except in the method of working. In primitive forms cilia cover the entire \\nbody, but in more specialized forms cilia are restricted to certain regions only. Cilia arise \\nfrom kinetosomes, from each kinetosome arises a rhizoplast which does not join the \\nnucleus, nor do cilia bear any mastigonemes. Running slightly to the right of a longitudinal \\nrow of kinetosomes is a delicate thread called kinetodesma. A row of kinetosomes with \\nits kinetodesmata forms a longitudinal unit called kinety, all kinetia of an animal constitue \\nits infraciliary system. Infraciliary system is characteristic of all ciliates, even in those forms \\nin which cilia are lost in the adults the infraciliary system is retained. \\nNutrition \\nNutrition is a process in which food is taken in, digested, absorbed and assimilated; \\nin fact, it is the process by which the organisms derive their nutrients essential for the \\ngrowth and maintenance of their life activities. The modes of nutrition vary greatly in \\nProtozoa because of their various mode of living habits. However, in Protozoa, the nutrition \\nis of the following types: \\n1. Holozoic or Zootrophic \\nMajority of Protozoa nutrite holozoically, i.e., like animals on solid food. The food \\nof protozoa consists of micro-organism like bacteria, diatoms, rotifers, crustacean larvae, \\nother protozoans, algae, small fragments of large animals and plants, etc. This mode of \\nnutrition essentially involves the processes like intake of food, i.e., ingestion, digestion, \\nabsorption and egestion of undigested residues. \\n(a) Ingestion: The mode of food ingestion in Protozoa is characteristically referred \\nto as phagocytosis or phagotrophy. In fact, in flagellates which are colourless or who \\nhave lost their chromatophores capture food with the help of their flagella. The captured \\nfood is ingested either at definite sites on their naked bodies like Budo or through \\ncharacteristic oral apparatus like Euglena where cytostome and cy~opharynx help in \\ningestion. In some other flagellates like Perallema, special rod-like structures called trichites \\nhelp in capturing the food. In Sarcodina, pseudopodia help in food capturing by forming \\nfood cups. \\n(b) Digestion: Digestion in Protozoa is intracellular within food vacuoles. The food \\nvacuoles undergo changes in pH and in their size during digestion. At first the contents \\nof the food vacuole are acidic and the vacuoles decrease in size, during this phase living \\nprey dies. After the initial acid phase the cytoplasm of the protozoan produces enzymes \\nin an alkaline medium, the enzymes pass into the food vacuoles and the vacuoles increase \\nin size and become alkaline. Then the contents of the vacuoles are digested. In fact, \\nproteolytic and carbohydrate digesting enzymes are reported in Protozoa; the proteins areEUKARYOTA 375 \\nconverted into dipeptides in acidic medium and the dipeptides into amino-acids in \\nalkaline medium. The carbohydrates are hydrolysed in alkaline medium. The fat digesting \\nenzymes have also been reported in some Protozoa. \\n(c) Absorption and assimilation: The digested food from the food vacuole is diffused \\nout into the endoplasm and finally assimilated in the body to manufacture the protoplasm. \\nThe excess of food is stored in form of glycogen paramylon, paraglycogen bodies in the \\nendoplasm. \\n(d) Egestion: The undigestible remains of the food are egested out from the body \\nat any body surface, eg., in Amoeba. But ciliates possess a definite opening for the egestion \\nof undigested remains called cytoproct or cytopyge. . \\n2. Pinocytosis \\nPinocytois or cell-drinking has also been reported in some Protozoa like Amoeba \\nproteus, and also in certain flagellates and ciliates. It is related to the ingestion of liquid \\nfood by invagination of the general body surface. It may occur at any part of the body; \\nduring pinocytosis, some pinocytic channels are formed from the outer body surface deep \\ninto the body. The inner ends of these channels contain pinocytic vesicles or pinosomes \\nwhich get separated after engulfing liquid food through the channels. The separated \\npinosomes become the food vacuoles. This process is induced in presence of certain salts \\nand some proteins. \\n3. Autotrophic or Holophytic Nutrition \\nProtozoa with chlorophyll or some allied pigment can manufacture complex organic \\nfood, like those of green plants, from simple inorganic substances, e.g., Euglena, Noctiluca. \\nOften there may be protein bodies called pyrenoids which are the centres of photosynthesis. \\nSome protozoa have no chromatophores but they have chlorophyll-bearing algae \\nZooxantllellae or Zooc1zlorellae which manufacture organic food for the host by photosynthesis, \\ne.g., Ste1ltor, Paramaecium bursaria. Nitrates or ammonium compounds are sufficient as the \\nsource of nitrogen for autotrophic forms. \\n4. Saprozoic Nutrition \\nSome Protozoa absorb complex organic substances in solution through the body \\nsurface by the process of osmosis called osmotrophy. These protozoa are called saprozoic. \\nSaprozoic forms need ammonium salts, amino acids, or peptones for their nutritional \\nrequirements. Decaying of animals and plants in water forms protein and carbohydrates. \\nThe saprozoic Protozo,!-are usually parasites like MonoClJstis. \\n5. Parasitic Nutrition \\nThe parasitic forms feed either holozoically or saprozoically. Thus, the parasites \\nmay be grouped into two categories on the nature of food and their mode of feeding: \\n(i) Food - robbers: The parasites feeding upon the undigested or digested food stuffs \\nof their hosts are known as food-robbers, such as some ciliate parasities like Nyctot/zems, \\nBalantidium. \\n(ii) Pathogenic: The protozoan parasites causing harm to their hosts, usually feed \\nupon the living tissues of the host. They absorb liquid food through their general body \\nsurface eg., TnJPanosoma, Plasmodium, etc.376 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n6. Coprozoic Nutrition \\nCertain free-living protozoans are in habit of feeding upon the faecal matters of the \\nother organisms like ClamydophnJs and Dimastigamoeba. \\n7. Mixotrophic Nutrition \\nSome protozoa nourish themselves ,by more than one method at the same time or \\nat different times due to change in environment. This is called mixotrophic nutrition, e.g., \\nEuglena gracilis and Perallema are both saprozoic and autotrophic in their nutrition, and \\nsome flagellates are both autorophic and zootrophic. \\nREPRODUCTION \\nThe mode of reproduction in protozoa is highly variable among different group \\nalthough it is primarily a cell division. Protozoa reproduce both asexually and sexually. \\nAsexual Reproduction \\n1. Equal or binary fission: Equal or binary fission takes place for reproducing and \\nalso for gamete formation. Usually there is a centriole within the nucleus, b\\'.lt unlike \\nmetazoa no asters are formed, moreover the nuclear membrane persists intact during \\ndivision in most Protozoa. The nucleus elongates and divides amitotically into two parts \\nwhich travel apart, then the cell constricts in the middle to form two daughter cells. \\nMacronuclei of ciliates divide amitotically. Binary fission is simple in Sarcodina like \\nAmoeba where the plane of division is not definite and it is usually transverse in ciliates \\nlike Paramecium but in most flagellates like Euglena it is longitudinal in which the nucleus \\nelongate~ transversely, but the cell divides length wise, while binary fission is oblique \\nin certain cases like Ceratiu1ll. In binary fission (in flagellates) a single flagellum is retained \\nusually by one daughter cell, and the basal granule divided into two, the new basal \\ngranule forms a flagellum in the other daughter cell. When there are many flagella they \\nare distributed among the daughter cells which grow new flagella to co~plete the number. \\nCilia are shared by daughter cells and new cilia are formed by kinetosomes to complete \\nthe number. Chromatophores usually divide but contractile vacuoles rarely divide, they \\nare generally shared or are made anew. Complex organelles are destroyed and then re\\xad\\nmade in the daughter cells. \\n2. Multiple Fission: The nucleus divides repeatedly without division of the cytoplasm, \\nlater the cytoplasm separates into as many parts as there are nuclei, usually some residual \\ncytoplasm is left unsegmented. If multiple fission produces four or more young ones by \\nequal cell division, and the young ones do not separate till the process is completed, then \\nsuch cell division is spoken of as repeated fission, e.g., Vorticella. Multiple fission produces \\nsmall cells which may grow into adults or they may become gametes which require \\nfertilization to form sporozoites (Plasmodium). The multiple fission may lead either to \\nasexual or sexual reproduction. \\n3. Plasmotomy: An asexual division of a multinucleate animal in which the \\ncytoplasm divides but the nuclei do not is called plasmotomy (Opalina, Pel'),\n",

Plasmotomy: An asexual division of a multinucleate animal in which the \\ncytoplasm divides but the nuclei do not is called plasmotomy (Opalina, Pelomyxa). Later \\neach daughter cell regains the normal number of nuclei by nuclear division.EUKARYOTA 377 \\n4. Budding: An unequal division of the parent body produces one or more buds \\nwhich may separate from the parent, the nucleus of the bud is a part of the parent nucleus, \\ne.g., Arcella. The bud is smaller than the parent; the buds may grow into adults or may \\nbecome gametes. When buds are formed on the surface of the parent, then this is known \\nas exogenous budding, e.g., Noctiluca produces hundreds of buds on its surface as small \\nprotuberances. When the buds are formed inside the cytoplasm and may remain within \\nthe parent, then the process is called endogenous budding, e.g, Arcella. Endogenous \\nbudding may be a method of asexual reproduction or it may bring about formation of \\ngametes, eg., Arcella becomes multinucleate, protoplasm collects around the nuclei to form \\nmany amoebulae which escape from the parent and grow into adults. \\n5. parthenogenesis: Parthenogenesis is the ability of the gametes to develop into \\nadults without fertilization by gametes of the opposite sex, the gamete possessing this \\npower is almost always the female one, e.g, in Actinophnjs two individuals get enclosed \\nin a cyst, each divides to form two gametes, one gamete of an individual conjugates with \\na gamete of the other individual, the remaining gamete of each individual develops \\nparthenogenetically into an adult. Thus, gametes which have been unable to undergo cross \\nfertilization develop by parthenogenesis. Potential gametes of Chlamydomonas will grow \\nand divide to become adults when they have missed syngamy. Endomixis of ciliates is \\nalso a parthenogenetic phenomenon. The chromosome condition in parthenogenesis may \\nbe expected to be haploid since no fertilization occurs, but it is generally diploid. \\n6. Regeneration: Regeneration is the capacity to form new tissues to replace a lost \\npart, this capacity varies inversely with the complexity of an organism. In protozoa any \\nnucleated portion is capable of regeneration, while non-nucleated portions are not, e.g, \\nStentor has a long chain-like nucleus, if the animal is cut transversely into say three parts, \\nthen each piece having a portion of the nucleus will regenerate the missing portions and \\nthree Stentors will be formed. \\nSexual Reproduction \\nSexual reproduction occurs by the following methods in Protozoa: \\n1. Syngamy ot\\' copulation: Syngamy is the union and complete fusion of two gametes \\nof the same species. If the two gametes are identical morphologically, though they may \\nbe different physiologically, then they are isogametes and their syngamy is isogamy \\n(MonOCljstis). If the gametes differ in size and morphology, then they ar~ anisogametes and \\ntheir syng2my is anisogamy (Plasmodium). The smaller, usually numerous and motile \\ngametes are male or microgametes; the larger, generally few and inactive gametes are \\nfemale or macrogametes. Meiosis or reduction division occurs generally in the formation \\nof gametes, but in many flagellates meiosis is post-zygotic, that is, it occurs after the \\nformation of the zygote. The fusion of two gametes produces a zygote, its nucleus is formed \\nby the fusion of nuclei of gametes, and it is called a synkaryon. The zygote may develop \\ndirectly into an adult, or it may encyst and undergo multiple fission. Syngamy whether \\nisogamous or anisogamous is always exogamous, that is, the fusing gametes come from \\ndifferent parents, hence, sex distinction may be said to exist in Protozoa, though sexes \\nmay not be distinguished.378 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\n2. Conjugation: Conjugation is a temporary union of two Protozoa of the same \\nspecies for an exchange of nuclear material without the fusion of their cytoplasm, e.g, \\nin Paramecium caudataum. In ciliates there is no formation of distinct gametes. \\nA sexual process somewhat intermediate between syngamy & conjugation occurs \\nin Vorticella in which one individual forms one to four microgametes by repeated fission, \\nand the other individual forms a macrogamete by nuclear modification, the macrogamete \\nis a hologamete because it is not formed by fission. Thus, Vorticella shows sexual \\ndimorphism in its gametes, a microgamete fuses with a macrogamete to form a zygote. \\nThe zygote by three divisions produces seven cells which grow into adults. \\nIn both syngamy and conjugation there is a rejuvenation of the animal by \\nreplacement of the macronucleus with material from the synkaryon, both processes \\nproduce new types of individuals by combination of genes, hence they give the race a \\nbetter chance of survival. \\n3. Automixis: In some Protozoa the nucleus divides into two, the two nuclei fuse \\ntogether, this is called automixis. If the two nuclei which fuse are present in a single cell, \\nthen the process is called autogamy, but if the two fusing nuclei are present in two different \\ncells, then the process is known as paedogamy. Autogamy occurs in a single Paramecium \\naurelia which provides both the fusing nuclei to form a synkaryon. Paedogamy occurs \\nin Actinosphaerium and Actinophnjs in which two cells of a secondary cyst and their two \\nremaining nuclei fuse to form a zygote which reproduces by binary fission. \\nSexual reproduction of Protozoa differs from the sexual reproduction of metazoa \\nin that the protozoan is both somatic and gametic. For many generations there is a somatic \\nphase in which binary fission occurs, then one generation is gametic in which syngamy \\nor conjugation takes place. The function of binary fission is reproduction or increasing \\nthe number of individuals, and the function of syngamy or conjugation is rejuvenation, \\nbut not reproduction although it is called \\'Sexual reproduction\\'. In the life cycle of some \\nprotozoa binary fission alternates with syngamy, this alternation may have regular sexual \\nand asexual generations (Elphidium), but more usually binary fission is repeated for many \\ngenerations continuously, and it is broken only occasionally by syngamy or conjugation. \\nProbably the occasional conjugation occurs only when the physiological condition of the \\nanimal becomes different from normal (Parall~\\'ecium). \\n4. Endomixis: It is a type of nuclear reorganization which usually occurs when \\nconjugation is prevented. In this case fusion of pro-nuclei does not take place. But the \\nmacronucleus is reorganized from micronuclear material. The reorganized macronucleus \\naccelerates the metabolic activities of the individual and helps in the renewal of the vigour \\nas is reported in Paramecium aurelia. \\n5. Hemixis: It has been reported in the various species of Paramecium like P. caudatum, \\nP. aurelia and P. multi11licrOllucleatu11l. In this case, the macronucleus throws away its many \\nfragments of different sizes in the cytoplasm which are absorbed in it. The left out part \\nof macronucleus, then starts behaving in a normal way and becomes the fresh macronucleus. \\nThe micronucleus, however, plays no part in hemixis and remains inactive and unchanged \\nduring this process.EUKARYOTA 379 \\nParasitism in Protozoa \\nThe relationship between two organisms may be symbiosis, commensalisms, or \\nparasitism. \\nSymbiosis is a relationship in which there is reciprocal benefit between one animal \\ncalled a symbiont and the other called a host, the symbiont lives in the body of the host, \\ne.g, Trichonympha lives in the gut of termites in symbiotic relationship, Trichonympha \\nobtains food & lodging, & in return it digests the wood eaten by termites, the termites \\nare incapable of digesting wood. \\nCommensalism is an association in which one organism called a commensal is \\nbenefited, & the other organism known as the host is neither benefited nor harmed, eg., \\nNyctotherus is cockroach gets food from the host, but the host is not injured in any way. \\nThe distinction between symbiosis & commensalisms is not very sharp; Entamoeba coli in \\nman is usually a commensal, but it may become symbiotic when it eats up bacteria which. \\nmay be harmful to man. \\nParasitism is an association in which one organism, the parasite lives on the body \\nor inside the body and at the expense of another organism known as the host. Parasitic \\nmode of life is a secondary state, the parasites having arisen frequently and independently \\nfrom free-living ancestors. The relationship of a parasite to its host is of varying degrees \\nof intimacy, the parasite may be epizoic or endozoic. \\nThe Flagellate Protozoa: The Mastigophora \\nThe Mastigophora are protozoa that always bear flagella as the locomotor organelles. \\nIn contrast to the ciliates, in which cell division is transverse, flagellate protozoa undergo \\nlongitudinal division. This mode of division has already been described for a photosynthetic \\nflagellate, Euglena. In addition to leucophytes, this protozoan group includes many \\nrepresentatives that show no resemblance to photosynthetic flagellates and are for the most \\npart parasites of animals. \\nThe trypanosomes are frequently parasitic in vertebrates, where they develop in the \\nbloodstream, being transmitted from host to host by the bite of insects. The cell is slender \\nand leaf-shaped, its single flagellum being directed posteriorly and attached through part \\nof its length to the body of the cell, to form an undulating membrane. The trypanosomes \\nare osmotrophic protozoa, which absorb their nutrients from the blood of the host. \\nOther parasitic flagellates inhabit the gut of vertebrates or invertebrates. The \\ntrichomonads, which have four to six flagella are harmless inhabitants of the gut of \\nvertebrates. \\nThe Amoeboid Protozoa: The Rhizopoda \\nThe Rhizopoda are protozoa in which ameboid locomotion is the predominant mode \\nof cell movement, although some of them are able to produce flagella as well. The simplest \\nmembers of this group are amebae, which have characteristically amorphous cells as a \\nresult of the continuous changes of shape brought about by the extension of psedudopodia.380 TEXT BOOK OF MICROBIOLOGY \\nMost amebae are free-living soil or water organisms that phagocytize smaller prey. A few \\ninhabit the animal gut, including forms that cause disease (amebic dysentery). Other \\nmembers of the Rhizopoda have a well-defined cell form, as the -result of the formation \\nof an exoskeleton or shell (typical of the foraminifera) or an endoskeleton (typical of the \\nheliozoan and radiolaria). \\nThe Ciliate Protozoa: The Ciliophora \\nThe ciliate protozoa are a very large and varied group of aquatic, phagotrophic \\norganisms that are particular widely distributed in fresh water. The ciliates share a number \\nof fundamental cellular characters that distinguish them sharply from all other protests. \\nThis suggest that despite the very great internal diversity of this group, it is one class \\nof protozoa that may have had a single common evolutionary origin. \\nAt some time in the life history, the cell is motile by means of numerous short, hair \\nlike projections, structurally homologous with flagella, which are termed cilia. Each cilium \\narises from a basal structure, the kinetosome, which is homologous with the kinetosome \\nof a flagellum; however, in ciliates the kinetosomes are inter connected by rows of fibrils \\ncalled kinetodesmata to form very elaborate compound locomotor structures termed kineties. \\nThis internal system persists, even if the cell is devoid of cilia. \\nCLASSIFICATION \\nThe classification followed here is given by the committee on Taxonomy & \\nTaxonomic problems of the society of protozoologists (Honigberg et al. 1964).
